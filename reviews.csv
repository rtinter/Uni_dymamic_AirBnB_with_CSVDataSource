199568,486392,2011-08-29,66482,Victoria & Rob,"The Garden Apartment is lovely. It is open, airy, clean and comfortable. It was lovely to be right off of the garden and able to sit out on the patio where there is seating, including a table for dining. The little kitchenette was well-equipped. Sarah is an attentive and thoughtful host. I very much enjoyed her conversation and company and look forward to our next stay in the Garden Apartment. I heartily recommend this listing!"
199568,491741,2011-08-31,66482,Victoria & Rob,"We were so pleased with the apartment and our host, Sarah, that we stayed another night. Wonderful host and location. Just a few minutes by car from downtown Salem. Could even bike there easily. We will be back to stay here again, many times, I am sure."
199568,608314,2011-10-08,201283,Jenny," I stayed at Sara's apt.for two weeks while working in Salem. Everything was great. Sara is a very gracious host and the apt is large, clean and opens onto a patio and garden. So much nicer than a hotel! Will definitely be staying again when I work in Salem."
199568,615016,2011-10-10,66482,Victoria & Rob,My aunt and I enjoyed our stay in the lovely garden apartment. Plenty of light even in the autumn weather. Sara provided top-quality granola and greek yogurt and a nice selection of ripe fruit. I heartily recommend this rental to anyone!
199568,644195,2011-10-18,933601,Linda And Jerry,"We truly enjoyed a restful time and environment in Sara's accomodations.  Peaceful is how we keep talking about it.  The view of Sara's gardens was delightful, the decor was clean and minmal, the space open, and we had everything we needed, including her gift of a wonderful breakfast.  We learned so much about her interests just by browsing through her library and it was enjoyable to hear about her travels. And one of the best things about our stay was no check-out time, so we could even take a little nap before our 4 hour drive home. Thank you Sara! "
199568,664590,2011-10-25,1296410,Dean,"The Garden studio is very comforable with a bright southern exposure overlooking teh garden.  In addition to a comfortable bed, the studio offered a kitchen w/refrigerator stocked with eggs, milk, jam, etc. washer/drier, hot plate, microwave, toaster, and dishes. Breakfast was DYI for me due to being on eastern time.  The den with wood burning stove made for a cozy place to read, the bathroom had an interesting map of the mideast on the wall, tiled shower small but functional.  <br/><br/>EVERYTHING was very clean.  There also was a sense of sustainablity in the use of re-useable things.  My host was considerate not to expose me to the cold she was sufferning at the time which was greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>Don't be put off by the neighborhood. It is safe and convenient.  <br/><br/>Overall, a great place to stay and a good experience. <br/> "
199568,743572,2011-11-25,1411582,Greg,"Sara is a great host.  She made the breakfast we requested (on Thanksgiving, no less), kept the fireplace going, stocked the bathroom well and explained everything that could trip us up (like the bedroom heating).  The house is quiet as is the neighborhood.  The beds were comfortable, the living room was cozy (TV and a lot of Sara's books) and the view of the garden and the frolicking birds was a nice way to wake up.  Some pointers for future guests:  the bedroom heater tends to start slowly but ramp up - be careful how much you turn it up.  If you get cold easily, take the bed by the heater, because the heat doesn't move over as much to the garden-side bed.  Also consider bringing your own pillow if you need better neck support - the pillows on the heater-side bed were a bit thin for me.  If you're there during cold periods, don't be freaked to see a few ants walking around - it's pretty typical for such a ground-level unit and Sara told us she's working to exterminate them.  Just make sure to put food away in the mini-fridge or cabinets.  We'd stay there again - good value, good amenities, good location, good service!"
199568,747907,2011-11-27,62065,Janet,"We had such a lovely time at Sara's.  The space was beautiful and the South facing windows gave a lovely warm view to a blustery day.  There was a woodstove that made everything cozy, lots of books, and some nice breakfast treats.  We had only a short visit, and wished we could have stayed another night or two.  This would be a great place for an extended stay, if you have work in Salem.  Very close to downtown.  Also if you are doing a Willamette Valley wine tour, this would be a good home base.  Thanks Sara, we will be back!"
199568,815138,2011-12-30,1478026,Sebastian,Sara you are truly awesome!  Thank you for a lovely stay and I look forward to getting back there real soon.  All the best!  Seb
199568,839274,2012-01-04,1339841,Michael,"Sara was a wonderful host. My wife, daughter and I returned very late to a lit fire and warm house which was so much more than we expected. The list goes on : Cinnamon Rolls, Milk, an assortment of Teas etc. The house was spacious with great accommodations for comfort. Thank you Sara.   "
199568,861160,2012-01-14,479365,Stacy,"Sara's apartment was great! Very cozy, with a fireplace, a well stocked kitchen, lots of information about Salem and walking distance to downtown. We would definitely stay here again!!"
199568,894521,2012-01-31,1478026,Sebastian,"Sara, I love staying at your place.  It feels like home.  Thank you so much for everything... leaving is always difficult!"
199568,940985,2012-02-22,1588278,Kristi,"Sara, our ""house mom"" for our week stay in Salem, was so very kind and considerate. From a lit fire when we arrived late to gluten free bread (she knew I had Celiac), homemade jam, organic fruit bowl, fresh juice, and other tasty selections set out for us, we felt cared for and nurtured all week! The privacy of this Garden Studio Apartment was perfect with its own kitchen (the photo doesn't do it justice), living room lined with books, large bedroom and own bathroom. The view of Sara's garden was magical and a breath of relaxation after long days of training.  I hope we need to return to Salem soon so we can stay here again! "
199568,944648,2012-02-23,66482,Victoria & Rob,"I stayed at Sara's with my sister this time. Spoiled Sis usually would stay at The Grand Hotel, but now that she has experienced staying at Sara's, the Grand is no longer good enough!  We were so comfy reading by the gas fireplace, and the beds were so comfy, and Sara's company was so fine when she accepted our invitation to visit over a glass of wine, that we decided to stay an extra night so we could experience all that a second time. Really, this is a special bnb and a special hostess. You could not do better than to stay at Sara's. "
199568,989657,2012-03-11,1405658,Karen,"Very nice, on very short notice. I had a lovely time. Comfortable, sparkling clean, spacious, and nice host."
199568,1118544,2012-04-12,2016982,Gabriele,"This is the best place to stay in Salem. The Garden Studio is warm and inviting, and it was much bigger than it appears in the pictures. It felt like home, very cozy and very inviting. Sara is such a nice and warm person, providing gluten-free food and making great restaurant suggestions. I stayed in Salem for a conference and wished I would have had more time enjoying the studio and chatting with Sara. I also loved the view and quiet of the garden. I will be back for a vacation some day. Like I said, the best place in Salem is the Garden Studio."
199568,1144237,2012-04-17,1381233,Pamela,"Such a wonderful experience staying here. Everything was a delight-- the lovely garden, beautiful rooms, peaceful location and most of all, Sara herself. We're looking forward to our next visit to West Salem."
199568,1148156,2012-04-18,1421154,Andrew,"This basement apartment is a fantastic space.  It is very light, has all of the amenities one would ever need, and even has access to the comfortable back patio.  The decorations, welcoming feeling, and cleanliness were all top notch.<br/><br/>The spot is a bit of a trek to downtown but on foot, but totally doable.  If you are walking downtown I suggest taking a bit extra time to go on the pedestrian bridge versus the more direct road bridge, a very cool trial. I wish I had my bike to explore more!<br/><br/>Sara is easy to deal with, this apartment is fantastic, and it is a very good value.  Would definitely stay here again.  "
199568,1154644,2012-04-20,1731762,Patricia,We had an excellent stay. Enjoyed drinking coffee out on the patio in the morning and sitting in front of the fire at night.
199568,1222675,2012-05-03,2105822,Robert,"great accommodation, very roomy and a good location. loved the fire that Sara built for us!"
199568,1266894,2012-05-12,2120316,Carolyn,"Sara was great--so thoughtful and pleasant.<br/>The apartment is very spacious, comfortable, and quiet. <br/>The garden is beautiful too--it is definitely a garden studio apartment!"
199568,1283124,2012-05-15,1708673,Deborah,"This was a perfect introduction to airbnb.  Sara is lovely and welcoming and the garden apartment far exceeded our expectations. It is decorated well, bed was very comfortable and it was fabulous having a small kitchen  and access to the garden patio.  I never want to  stay in a hotel again. We will definitely recommend Sara and her apartment to anyone we know visiting Salem."
199568,1296661,2012-05-17,836987,Jonathan,Sara was an amazing host. My visit to Salem was business related and very busy. Sara was very helpful with working around my crazy schedule to get me the keys. The place was very nice and felt like a home. She has a beautiful garden and patio area that is great for sitting and enjoying a cup of coffee in the morning. I hope next time I am in Salem I can bring my family for a visit of leisure.  
199568,1363276,2012-05-28,2172421,Andrea,Loved it just as much the second time.  Especially the laundry!
199568,1406778,2012-06-03,2172421,Andrea,"Sara is a great host.  The garden studio is a large apartment with everything you need.  The little kitchen was so convenient, and Sara had even stocked the essentials.  We started the fire on the last night of our stay and it was very toasty.  The backyard garden is very private, and so beautiful!  We extended our stay and Sara was very accomodating.  Would definately stay again."
199568,1494232,2012-06-16,2413209,Bill,"I Highly recommend staying with Sara.  My wife and I were riding a tandem bike from Eugene to Portland.   Sara helped us by finding local bike maps even before we arrived.  For breakfast she prepare non-gluten ingredients to meet our special needs.  The space is bright and clean and includes a large kitchen with a washer dryer!.  It even has a wood burning stove for extra warmth, and a beautiful garden.  You may not want to leave."
199568,1502654,2012-06-18,1795798,Angela,"This studio is great! It's very peaceful and serene and Sara keeps it clean and well stocked. It's pretty much the perfect home away from home. Sara is an excellent host, very easy to talk to and provides great info on the area - she even filled me in on the local vernacular :)<br/><br/>I will definitely stay again next time I'm in Salem."
199568,1572490,2012-06-26,2425067,Faith,"Sara is so warm and welcoming. It was my first time on airbnb so I was worried it might be a bit awkward, but it wasn't at all. I highly recommend Sara as a host."
199568,1786646,2012-07-24,2033371,Mary,"My mother and I really enjoyed our stay at Sara's garden studio apartment.  It was clean, comfortable and was our home away from home for 11 days.  We would definitely stay here again when visiting the area.  Thank you Sara!"
199568,1811130,2012-07-27,791585,Shari,"We stayed two nights in this lovely place.  The apartment is private, roomy and tidy with lots of good books and resources about the area.  The garden is spectacular.  Sara was a great host--we really enjoyed talking with her and wish we would have had more time to talk.  She was extremely helpful and provided coffee, berries, and granola for breakfast--unexpected but very much appreciated.  Highly recommend staying here."
199568,1917348,2012-08-07,3002990,Amy,"Sara was so sweet and helpful! We had a very busy schedule while visiting Salem since we were visiting our friends for their wedding just outside of the city. There were alot of events planned where we didn't come back until late in the night but Sara made everything so easy. Since we didn't get back until late sometimes, it was great that we had a separate entrance to enter the apartment. You wouldn't even know that anyone was upstairs, it was so quiet! The apartment was very clean and well kept. The kitchen was totally stocked with everything you can think of and she even had the fridge stocked with the essentials! This was our first air bnb experience and we will defiantly rent again if all our hostesses are like Sara!! Whenever we are back in Salem this is the only place we will stay now!"
199568,2175641,2012-09-02,1851439,Darwin,"Sara and her apt. are wonderful! She provides everything a traveller might need. Our stay there was very convenient, peaceful and pleasant"
199568,2461401,2012-10-01,2057093,Rebecca,"I rented this place for a whole month(!) and Sarah was a great hostess. She was so friendly and made me feel at ease being so far away from my friends and family. Her apartment was clean and comfortable. There is a mini-fridge, stove top, washer and dryer available. Lots of good parks nearby for running or walking. The neighborhood was safe and I would stay here again if in Salem. "
199568,2784080,2012-11-02,980966,Cis,"I was on a Travel nurse assignment and spent one month of it at a hotel type apt, very nice to have it cleaned but it was close to the highway and really kind of dull and not much nature around. When I saw the garden apt it was just what I wanted and when I got in touch with Sara she was a sweetheart, easy to talk to and has become a friend. The apt is sweet and surrounded by gardens, really is what I needed and wanted. Have another month to go and Sara has been very accomodating. She also knows everything there is to know about the area!!!"
199568,3896745,2013-03-25,5393077,Porthos,"Since this was my first experience as an Airbnb guest, I didn't know exactly what to expect...but I was pleasantly surprised. Sara was an excellent host, very attentive to my (rather minimal) needs. The apartment was removed enough from the hustle and bustle of city traffic to be peaceful, but close enough that I could get where I wanted to go without difficulty. All in all, it was a VERY pleasurable experience...and exactly the kind of thing for which I was looking while staying in Salem. I hope my next experiences with Airbnb come even close to approaching this caliber."
199568,4058197,2013-04-06,5693807,Sharon,"Sara's apartment is very charming and spacious.  I loved the cozy bed. I enjoyed the patio and garden, which I'm sure must be beautiful in summertime. (I was there in rainy April.)  Everything was very clean and comfortable.  I liked the little book-lined sitting room, and the kitchen had everything you'd need.  Sara is warm and helpful and I would have enjoyed chatting with her if I'd had more time, especially about her garden.  A delightful place to stay if you're visiting Salem!"
199568,4199983,2013-04-17,5869650,James,"I came to Salem for a conference and was not familiar with the area. Sara and the Garden Studio Apt. were wonderful! Sara met me there to give some instructions on the fireplace, amenities etc. and just to be a great and personable hostess. I indicated that I was interested in birding while I was in the area since I was traveling by foot while attending the conference and she immediately had me borrow a book specializing in the specific bird species of the area that I took on my walks each day. Her library is a wonderful resource for any traveler- just as Sara is fount of knowledge herself! I left knowing that this will be the place that I stay in Salem from now on!"
199568,4593853,2013-05-14,4371576,Ellen/ Tom,We recommend Saras' garden apartment in Salem.  This is a very pleasant space to be in with a lovely garden all around.  Sara is a welcoming and good host.  We were  treated to breakfast supplies that were delicious and much appreciated as it saved on some running around and expense over a busy weekend.
199568,4751100,2013-05-23,48796,Joan,The room was spacious and clean. The kitchen had basic staples. Sara was warm and inviting. The bed was comfortable. If we ever came to Salem we would stay here again
199568,5009006,2013-06-07,6181664,Bonnie,"Sara is a very friendly, helpful, and accommodating host.  The apartment has tons of information on the area and she provided great recommendations on places to visit in the area.  The apartment is exactly as shown in the photos and is stocked with anything you would need to make it functional.  She was also very helpful when my traveling partner had a dental emergency and got us in with a specialist recommended by her dentist - that's not something you want to just find using google!  I look forward to staying there again!"
199568,5054384,2013-06-10,889267,Linda,"We had planned to stay two nights, but a medical emergency required an additional two nights.  Sara made other arrangements for the guests who would have had the space we were in.  She was very graciously accommodating in our time of need."
199568,5632222,2013-07-09,4994085,Joseph,Loved Sara's Garden Studio. It was great space for our family and she was so accommodating. It is also really close to a number of food spots and quick trip across river to downtown Salem. Plan a trip in July to get some fresh berries from the garden!
199568,5842734,2013-07-19,6181664,Bonnie,Staying at Sara's was the best decision I made here in Salem!  It's such a beautiful property with something new blooming all the time. The location is great for accessing downtown and really any other parts of Salem. It's also a half mile walk to the grocery store and post office. Sara makes great recommendations and is willing to share a lifetime of knowledge of the area. I will be back!
199568,6727987,2013-08-23,6181664,Bonnie,Sara is a wonderful host.  It is almost like staying with family - she is outgoing and friendly and respects your privacy.  Sara has a very comfortable home and beautiful (and fruitful) garden.  I would definitely stay there again next time I am in Salem.
199568,7741880,2013-10-01,8037695,Clare,"Sara is AMAZING!!!!! And so very thoughtful!  Her studio apartment felt very much like home during my stay and it was very hard to leave.  Sara has a lot of knowledge of Oregon and the tourist places to visit and even provided me with a driver's manual to help me drive on the ""wrong"" side of the road.  I will definitely be coming back to Oregon and will definitely be looking up Sara's studio apartment again.  Thank you so much Sara for everything.  xoxo"
199568,8048911,2013-10-14,7374035,Sandra,This is a spacious apartment located within a quick drive to downtown Salem or Willamette University (where we were visiting our son).  Sara greeted us and made sure we knew where everything was.  The kitchen is well equipped.  Would definitely stay here again.
199568,8255255,2013-10-22,8738359,Julaina,"My mother and I stayed at Sarah's place and absolutely loved it. The apartment was very clean, spacious and inviting. We felt comfortable right away. Sarah made sure we had breakfast foods and all the information we needed for the apartment and the Salem area. We appreciated the privacy we had, coupled with the warm and friendly interactions we had with Sarah. If we ever have a need for a place in Salem again, we'll be checking if Sarah's is available. I'd love to enjoy a morning cup on the patio everyday. Such a gorgeous garden! We highly recommend staying at Sarah's."
199568,9317636,2013-12-21,9709586,Brad & Andrea,Sara was an exceptional host and very accomodating at all times.  Very friendly and totally separate entrance from main house on th upper level. The studio apt is actually quite large and clean with all the necessary items.  Parking is very easy and the location very good.  Close to downtown Salem.  We have nothing but positive comments and memories of our 1 month stay at Sara's. 
199568,9459951,2013-12-30,8585643,Lori,"I stayed at Sara's apartment with my husband and daughter and it was the perfect place for us. We loved it!!! Sara was a wonderful host: friendly, showed us around her apartment, helpful with suggestions of places to go and where to acquire things we might need in Salem, and then left us to ourselves. Sara also provided a wonderful variety of food, which was a sweet surprise!  Her place was great for the 3 of us.  Plenty of room, warm and cozy, quiet, and a lovely view into the garden.  I would like to go back in spring or summer and enjoy the yard and patio.  The kitchen was stocked with a wide variety of pots, pans, knives and cute dishes.  Great to be able to fix small meals.  The apartment is very visually pleasing with Sara's furnishings and art. And she also has a huge selection of books to keep you entertained.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is off a busy road, but it was quiet at Sara's home and felt safe. We were able to walk to stores in the area, which had everything we needed and if we'd had more time, we would have walked to the waterfront park.<br/><br/>Our experience at Sara's garden apartment was better than we anticipated and we all hope to stay there again in the future."
199568,10305295,2014-02-11,1739511,Giovanni,"Sara is a kind, graceful and accomodating host. The booking process was easy and smooth, the stay was very pleasant, and even though I was stuck in the apartment for a couple of days, due to a freak snow storm, I couldn't have been in a better place, with a wood-burning stove, plenty of wood, a fully stocked kitchen, cozy living room, comfortable bedroom and bathroom."
199568,12878844,2014-05-13,7374035,Sandra,This is the second time we have stayed at Sara's and this time we were able to enjoy the beauty of the garden in full bloom.  Would stay again if we are there in the future.
199568,14309366,2014-06-16,1626931,Tacoa,"We enjoyed our stay at Sara's.  She lives in a quiet neighborhood and has a lovely secluded backyard for her guests to enjoy.  The bed and pillows were a little too firm for me, but did enjoy the other furnishings and mini kitchen area.  Thanks Sara!<br/>"
199568,14786545,2014-06-26,3295766,Janet,Really enjoyed our stay at Sara's. Would recommend.
199568,15085757,2014-07-02,5659080,Jay,"We enjoyed our stay in Sara's Garden studio in Salem.  It was very spacious, with a separate sitting/dining room and a kitchen.  It's more like an apartment with large bedroom than a studio.  It was well furnished and the gardens were very pleasant.  You had to walk through them to get to the unit.  <br/>The unit was very clean, large, private and very pleasant to stay in.<br/>We never did meet Sara, but her daughter was in contact with us -- so everything was arranged and fine.<br/>We would be happy to stay here again if we are back to Salem."
199568,15556826,2014-07-11,960637,James,"Very nice! I spent 6 nights while I conducted business in town.  Everything is as described in the description / photos and other reviews so I won't  repeat it all.  I'll just add a few things and say that Sara was very welcoming and helpful!<br/><br/>The neighborhood is quiet, and very close to several parks to enjoy (don't miss the pedestrian bridge over the river).  Access to downtown is very easy.  The backyard garden is a very peaceful place to sit and enjoy.  There is a table/chairs to eat meals or do some work.  Lots of books and TV/DVD to keep you entertained along with good wireless internet.  It's great to be able to make some meals when you travel and the self-contained kitchen area has everything you'd need.<br/><br/>It was perfect for what I needed - would definitely stay here again if I'm in the area."
199568,15965174,2014-07-19,7728503,Regina,"This is an amazing spot...much more than we expected. Sara was so helpful with info about Salem and the areas around it, and she was also flexible for our schedule. The place was so clean AND roomy. The outdoors, just gorgeous. Parking was right outside the door and the neighborhood was great! Can't wait to visit Salem again and stay at this Airbnb. Thanks, Sara!"
199568,16069755,2014-07-21,15832888,Kelly,"Our stay in Salem was great. The apt. was clean and cool and very quiet.  The apt. is close to the park, downtown and shopping.. and there are great tamales at the bottom of the hill.  Sara was helpful and kind and overall the visit was great.  The entire place was very well-appointed and Sara made every effort to ensure our pleasant stay. Thank you!"
199568,17317948,2014-08-10,9493157,Jim,"Thank you kindly, Sara!  We really enjoyed meeting you - your welcome was warm  and we appreciated your thoughtful check-ins to make sure we could find everything and to make sure we were enjoying our stay.  <br/><br/>Your  apartment was delightful, clean, safe, peaceful, and true to your description.   Our favorite part of our stay was sitting in your garden with our morning  coffee.  Thank you for your sincere hospitality - we loved the fresh berries and hope to stay with you again:)  <br/><br/>Best,<br/>Jim and Michael<br/><br/><br/><br/>"
199568,17600069,2014-08-14,7528941,Thomas,"Sara's place is wonderful! It is a spacious apartment, very well equipped, clean, with a great patio to relax. The place is very quiet. Downtown and shops are within walking distance. Sara was a perfect host, helpful, communicative, and cordially. I can definitely recommend Sara's apartment!"
199568,17999874,2014-08-20,7463981,Sarah,"Beautiful 'mother-in-law' apartment that 3 of us stayed in! Sara was very helpful, made excellent recommendations and made us feel very comfortable and welcome. Great place to stay as it was relaxing and close to many of Salem's amenities!"
199568,18304915,2014-08-25,2471769,Suzanne,"I stayed in the garden studio apartment with my two teenaged daughters.  At first they were skeptical that we were ""staying in someone's house"" rather than a traditional hotel.  But within hours they were commenting about how much they like the place.  I agreed. <br/><br/>We had plenty of room.  And there was a lovely garden that we enjoyed sitting in.  We all felt like we had the space, peace and privacy that a hotel does not afford.  I felt like I was staying in a friends apartment -- there were lots of homey touches like a great selection of books and provisions for the first morning. Sara also left a notebook listing everything from the wifi code to local restaurants.  <br/><br/>Sara was out of town during our stay, but she had arranged for her adult daughter to be available for help.  We ended up calling her for help with the wifi.  She was totally responsive and had the wifi up and running within the agreed upon timeframe.  <br/><br/>In short, it was a great stay.  I look forward to returning.  Feels like home away from home."
199568,19398825,2014-09-11,2694279,André,"Sara was a wonderful host. She responded to my request right away. That prompt communication continued throughout my stay. Upon my arrival, she was kind enough to have laid out some snacks, provide me a tour of the space, and point me in the direction of some local restaurants. <br/><br/>The space was just as described and offered all I could possibly need during my visit to Salem. I would definitely stay again!"
199568,19995446,2014-09-21,5846820,Deb (& John),"Spacious, secluded & sparkling clean!  Sara's place is perfect and especially nice if you are staying for any length of time.  All if our needs were met!  Graciously!"
199568,20394398,2014-09-28,9794929,Lisa,"Our host was very responsive & helpful.  The place was perfectly clean, and as described.  We really appreciated this option, as I was ""over"" hotels and our need was immediate.<br/>"
199568,20764075,2014-10-05,5468245,Carla,"This was my second time staying at Sara’s.  It is such a comfortable and peaceful place to stay – I can’t imagine staying anywhere else when visiting Salem.  Sara is an awesome host… she is very warm and easy going.  She is available if needed, but still gives you your privacy.<br/><br/>The kitchen is well stocked, including all you need for making coffee and some healthy snacks.  I appreciate that the bathroom is also well stocked with a hair dryer, shampoo and even hairspray.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend Sara’s place to anyone visiting Salem."
199568,21281247,2014-10-14,7524342,Kelly,Sara was very accommodating during our stay.  She was flexible on our arrival time and even provided a few small things we needed for packing before we left.  The apartment was very spacious and the sitting room with the eating table was just lovely.  We didn't realize from the listing that the apartment actually had a kitchenette so were pleasantly surprised to see that!  Essentially the kitchen was fully stocked and Sara left us breakfast food AND snacks for the entire stay....MUCH more than we've ever had left out for us at any other airbnb site.  She even left us fresh fruit and veggies from her garden.  We had a very nice stay and would recommend her apartment to others!
199568,22403660,2014-11-05,5216693,Kevin,"I live in Salem and stayed here for three weeks while looking for a long-term rental. The place is nice and the bedroom is spacious. There is a wood-burning stove and plenty of wood to help keep the place cozy.<br/><br/>The kitchen has a toaster oven and a portable two-burner electric stove. Not a full setup, but enough to easily make some small meals. <br/><br/>I work downtown, and it is about a 30-minute walk. This takes you through parks on both sides of the river. In the rainy season, you'll get a bit soggy on the trip, but it would be a great walk in the dry months. <br/><br/>Sarah was a nice, friendly host. This is a great place for one or two people. I would stay here again. "
199568,22799982,2014-11-15,18916001,Kalila,"This was a perfect place to land for a college visit to Willamette.<br/>It is cozy, and inviting, and just as pictured. The three separate yet connected spaces provide flexibility for both my son and I.  Sara is warm and helpful and helped us stay warm by getting a roaring fire going on a particularly cold night.  The neighborhood is easy to navigate- just about two miles from Willamette, close to everything. <br/>"
199568,23161485,2014-11-24,21189234,Eric,"Sara was a great host. My plans changed at the last minute and she was very accommodating. The apartment was even bigger that I expected, it was clean and the bed was comfortable. I really only slept at the apartment and never cooked, but the kitchen looked well stocked and ready. I would definitely recommend both the location and the host, Sara."
199568,24604004,2014-12-31,16511241,Kailea,"Sara was a great host. We were unable to stay at her garden studio apartment, but had a second property available very close to the train and the rest of town. The neighborhood was quiet and the house was beautiful. Perfect for a couple looking to getaway for a little while. Sara patiently waited for my boyfriend and I to arrive (our train was delayed) and was very welcoming. She let us know about restaurants and the park and the nearest supermarket. We really couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to stay and a more helpful host. Thank you!  "
199568,34304275,2015-06-07,31373702,Meredith,"Sara was an amazing hostess! We loved the garden studio and it was perfect for our family. Our girls enjoyed waking up each morning and spending time in the garden. The location is perfect for getting around Salem. We will be back again!<br/>"
199568,34970536,2015-06-14,32370550,Carol,"This lovely property with fantastic garden is quiet, peaceful, and private, while being close to downtown Salem.  We spent four nights here during our relocation to Salem.  Sara is a welcoming and helpful host; she has filled the spacious studio with wonderful books, art and pottery pieces.  The decor is tastefully and charmingly eclectic.  We give Sara and this property our highest recommendation!"
199568,35470817,2015-06-19,24378048,Loren,"Sara is a wonderful and welcoming host and her Garden Studio apartment is fantastic. The apartment is comfortable, spacious and well-stocked with just about everything needed. Sara had fresh fruit and veggies and wine waiting for our arrival. There was a more than adequate variety of breakfast items along with milk, tea and coffee to send us off with a good start each day. The quiet location is only a few minutes drive from the heart of downtown and is easily walkable through pleasant parks and trails and the old railroad bridge across the river. We were in town for an American Volkssport Association convention and with morning walks and afternoon convention sessions our schedule was very full. It was so relaxing to come back each evening to the privacy and serenity of Sara's beautifully landscaped garden apartment. If we are ever back in Salem we will certainly look first to Sara for our lodging."
199568,36671225,2015-06-30,10095153,Lola,"If you are unsure about Airbnb, stay at Sara's and you will be an instant convert!  This lovely, huge and spotlessly clean downstairs apartment, with private patio, full kitchen (small fridge and two-burner cooktop), washer and dryer, and all the closet space you might want was the highlight of our trip.  Sara was excellent at keeping in touch through texting and e-mail.  She greeted us the evening we arrived by bringing us fresh raspberries, yogurt, English muffins, and soy milk.  Also in the fridge were cut vegetables and hummus for dipping, a variety of jams (some homemade), oranges, apples, a kiwi, half and half for coffee, a bottle of wine.  There was granola in the cupboard and trail mix on the counter.  We read through the binder of local information (restaurant menus, etc.) and my husband took some of the walks she suggested.  We were walking distance to a grocery, restaurants, and a riverside park where there was a world music festival going on, yet Sara's house is an oasis of calm and quiet.  We opened the blinds and the patio door and luxuriated in the garden setting."
199568,37082209,2015-07-04,19661150,Donald,"We communicated with Sara as we arrived and she was there to greet us. She showed us the apartment and went over what we needed to know. She also informed us of places and local events happening in the area and how to get there.<br/><br/>The apartment was as described and was clean and well provisioned. It was in a very quiet neighborhood with a private entrance and a private patio garden to sit and read in.<br/><br/>We would certainly recommend this to others and return if heading to Salem again. "
199568,37698557,2015-07-09,15809141,Thomas (&Quot;Andy&Quot;),"Sara is a wonderful host. She goes the extra mile. The apartment is excellent, clean, spacious, and well appointed.  This was outstanding value."
199568,37969296,2015-07-12,32601126,Ashley,"My husband and I had a wonderful experience staying at Sara's studio apartment. It was beautiful, spacious, and fully equipped with anything we would need, including a fridge full of yummy food that Sara had thoughtfully bought. Sara sent us very detailed instructions in advance and gave us a quick tour when we arrived, so everything went smoothly. She also provided us with a binder of useful information about Salem, which was much appreciated for two people who had never visited the city before. Also the location of her place is great and very convenient - minutes from downtown, but in a quiet neighborhood. We would stay there again in a heart beat!"
199568,38933332,2015-07-19,30206340,Casey,We very much enjoyed Sara's cool apartment on a hot Oregon weekend.  Our 5 yo son enjoyed an eclectic collection of children's and art books and a family Go-Fish game on the a beautiful garden patio.
199568,39405925,2015-07-23,33602615,Katharina,"We very much enjoyed staying at Sara's beautiful, spacious, downstairs apartment in West Salem. We had a refrigerator filled with yummy breakfast items and also enjoyed eating our meals on the grapevine covered patio. We had an interesting talk with Sara and felt instantly connected to her.  This is definitely a place that I would highly recommend. Katharina"
199568,40032570,2015-07-27,6950786,Sandy,"Sara's studio is very spacious and well-lit. She has a great collection of books about the region, and was also available to give recommendations. I would recommend her place for visitors to Salem. "
199568,40922378,2015-08-03,12513490,Kiley,"My husband and I stayed at Sara's in law apartment for a long weekend in July and were so glad we did. The neighborhood was very peaceful and quiet and a great home base for our wine touring. We loved her place- from the beautiful decore to the garden patio- we felt so at home. The master bed was maybe the most comfiest I have ever slept in and the living room/library was a great spot too. Sara really thought of everything and had breakfast items and and snacks waiting for us in the kitchen. If you are considering staying here, we would definitely recommend it. Such a beautiful, comfortable roomy apartment."
199568,42744062,2015-08-15,19176907,Jeff,"We enjoyed our stay with Sara, check in was smooth and the apartment was clean and comfortable. Very nice outdoor area too.  Thanks Sara."

My husband, my daughter and I had a great stay.  We felt that finding Sara's place was a stroke of good fortune.  I would recommend it many times over!"
199568,45463826,2015-09-03,33570021,Roberta,Sara was wonderful.  She was very welcoming and kind.  She had a lot a great information in a binder about the Salem area.  The neighborhood of West Salem is a lovely mix of older and new homes and is very safe.  The site was more than we expected and we were pleasantly surprised.  We would stay there again.
199568,45845006,2015-09-06,31246522,Joanne,We really enjoyed the garden studio. Lots of room and very comfortable. Sara is a good host and welcoming. 
199568,47292176,2015-09-17,19039658,Robin,"Sarah's place was just perfect for us. Very quite, comfortable and convenient to downtown . Sarah was great, friendly but gave us our space. Would definitely recommend."
199568,47738064,2015-09-21,16244946,Robert,"We were in Salem for a friend's wedding (actually in Independence, at the Rogue Hop Farm) and were thrilled to book with Sara. The house is easy to find, and the lower level kept nice and cool during a hot summer weekend.<br/><br/>The kitchen is well-stocked with dishes and utensils, and Sara was kind to ask us prior to our arrival what we preferred for breakfast -- she had the little refrigerator stocked with fruit, eggs, and yogurt. There was a little coffee maker, along with an electric kettle and french press (which we prefer). <br/><br/>There are two beds -- a queen and a twin (I think) and the queen size bed has a very firm mattress, for those that prefer firm mattresses. <br/><br/>Sara was a wonderful host, and we had a very relaxing and enjoyable stay in Salem! Thanks, Sara!"
199568,48099169,2015-09-23,3023162,Carol,"Sara's garden apartment is lovely.  Very clean.  Stocked with welcoming goodies in the fridge.  Sara was a gracious, friendly, warm hostess.  She brought down a bottle of wine and some snacks to share with us as we sat outside in her yard and chatted. It was a nice way to unwind after a day-long road trip.  We were very comfortable and would stay again."
199568,48484742,2015-09-26,44959225,Brandon,"This is a lovely place to stay. Sara is very welcoming, and friendly(she had some toys that she put out for our 3 year old:) The location is nice and quiet, with a garden patio right out the door. The space is good sized and well appointed. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again, great experience!"
199568,53950481,2015-11-15,29531218,John,"We enjoyed our stay at Sara's. She was very hospitable, yet unobtrusive and still seemed to know exactly when we needed to see her. We felt welcomed our entire 6 weeks in the charming garden apartment. For the first four weeks our weather was mild so we could enjoy the outside patio, in a a very pleasing landscape, and each evening would find us under the grape arbor with refreshments discussing the day and planning for the next day. The apartment itself is nicely appointed and decorated, providing an overall cozy feeling, especially as the days began to get cooler and rainier. <br/>Sara is highly knowledgeable about OR and Salem - she gave us many pointers that we used to become more familiar with Salem and OR.  <br/>Salem turned out to be a very good location for us as we explored McMinnville, Portland, and Corvallis. And, when we needed a break, we took Sara up on her suggestions for long walks by heading to parks in Salem and several others an hour or so from Salem. Needless to say, OR has some spectacular forests and coastal preserves. Overall, we had an excellent stay at Sara's."
199568,56101604,2015-12-08,25955158,Corrie,"Sara was wonderful and her place was PERFECT.  I'm just sorry I didn't get to visit with her longer.  Such a busy time of year for me,  that I was exhausted! Her bed was VERY comfortable and I was not expecting her to have the fireplace going when I arrived.  Made it nice and warm and cozy!  I do hope she allows me to come visit again! <br/>Thanks Sara!"
199568,58285775,2016-01-02,8585643,Lori,"Sara offers a wonderful place to stay.  This was our 2nd visit, and it was just as great as the first!  Sara is very welcoming, easygoing, friendly and helpful. You couldn't ask for a better host.  The apartment is so comfortable and has everything we need.  The neighborhood is quiet and within walking distance of shops and a beautiful riverfront park.  We will definitely stay here again when we're in the area."
199568,61175306,2016-02-01,16789630,Anna,"Sara was a very welcoming hostess.  She greeted me as I drove up to the house and showed me around the apartment, as well as provided maps and a magazine that highlighted local attractions.  <br/><br/>I was working a distance from the city during my stay so I wasn't there often during the day, but enjoyed my brief interactions with Sara and wished I wasn't so busy so we could talk longer.  She was very accommodating and allowed me to move furniture around to make the space work for me.  She also checked in occasonally to see how the kitchenette space was working for me.  I did find that for me personally, I needed a full size kitchen to feel at home.  There were windows in all the rooms of the unit except the bathroom and kitchenette.  Someone who likes natural light when they cook might want to consider this.  <br/><br/>The neighborhood was pleasantly quiet and there were several conveniences within walking distance.  I enjoyed the park that was within walking distance as well as the river.  <br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed my stay and would recommend it for anyone looking for a weekend stay or few weeks stay.  "
199568,61715067,2016-02-07,16312400,Laurie,"Sara is wonderful-- she is warm and friendly and goes out of her way to make you feel like a family friend who has come to visit.  We arrived very late at night, yet she was kind, greeted us with a bottle of wine and snacks and exactly what we asked for in the refrigerator for a lovely breakfast-- and terrific coffee too!  You are minutes away from stores and a lovely walk across a bridge to Salem's sweet downtown.<br/><br/>The apartment was a nice surprise-- much much larger than we thought. It has two very large sleeping areas with privacy. I was there with my adult son and adult daughter and there was plenty of room.  There is a marvelous library and sitting room, with a fireplace that Sara  keeps lit for your return from a rainy Salem day.  The kitchen is a full kitchen with every imaginable cooking tool, spices and some staples. We were very happy to leave food there for the next lucky guests.<br/><br/>More than that-- we were in Salem to visit a critically ill family member and the week after we left, another set of family members arrived for a few hours-- and Sara took them in!    She made the sun shine in the middle of an Oregon winter and we are so very grateful.   You will enjoy this beautiful garden apartment and this warm  and friendly host.   We always stay in airbandb and Sara's place is one of the very, very best.  If you are going to Salem, this is the place to stay."
199568,62214222,2016-02-12,52481624,Megan,Sara was a wonderful host and very pleasant to chat with. The apartment was large and open as well as nice and clean. I'd recommend staying with Sara any time you're in Salem.

199568,62993997,2016-02-19,32074463,Anne,"Sara was a warm, welcoming host - all of our communication with her, both online and during our stay, was pleasant and efficient.<br/>The neighborhood is quiet and convenient.  The garden apartment is spacious, clean, well-equipped.  Much more than a studio - both the kitchen and the ""library"" are separate rooms in addition to the large bedroom area.  Comfortable bed(s) & plenty of nice linens.  Great to have W/D use.  Sara had asked what items we preferred for breakfast & also left treats of chocolate & fruit.  All in all, highly<br/>recommend a stay with Sara.<br/>"
199568,63442169,2016-02-22,59392071,Christopher,"Hard to imagine a more perfect Airbnb: kind hostess; quiet, safe, neighborhood; comfortable bed; nice sitting area with pretty garden view and cozy fire.  Thank you so much!"

There were lots of books, including kids books, which we really enjoyed. There is a beautiful garden to enjoy, and it felt very private. Sarah brought in some of our favorite foods for breakfast, which was really going out of her way to make our stay nice. She even picked us blackberries from her garden! Yum.<br/><br/>We visited with our 3-year old son, and in his words, ""Sarah is really nice!"" We would definitely stay here again."
199568,83918494,2016-07-04,52990288,Kate,"We absolutely loved our stay at Sara's. She was kind and friendly, the apartment was lovely and perfect for our needs. Sarah was very helpful in making it toddler safe for our son and she kindly provided blocks for him to play with. The garden was so beautiful and much larger than expected. Our son spent as much time playing outside as he could. The kitchen was just what we needed, I was able to cook our meals without issue using the hotplate and microwave. The linens on both beds were soft and pretty. We enjoyed the artwork and textiles in the apartment very much. The selection of books was very interesting and started my husband and I on some good conversations. Sarah directed us to an excellent park about a 20 mins walk (with toddler) away with an excellent playground, walking trail, and green space. The nearby grocery store had the organic items that we needed. We had such a lovely time and hope to stay there again next time we are in the area."
199568,84670087,2016-07-08,9407200,Sharon,Sara is a wonderful hostess.  The kitchen was well stocked and she had  fresh picked cherries for us.  Her place is spacious and very quiet.  We met Sara the next day and she is a very gracious lady.  We will stay again.

199568,87186407,2016-07-19,57550752,Carlie,"Comfortable, quiet, charming are just a few words  to describe Sara's Garden studio apartment.  I slept great and especially enjoyed  the garden area outside the grape arbored patio and very private back yard.  Sara was so gracious with all the breakfast food that she left for me and my husband.  It was a pleasure to interact with her and stay in her studio apartment.  The neighborhood had very little traffic.  There is a large grocery store a few blocks away with a great selection of organic produce, hot and cold food bar, and deli, along with more conventional items.  We hope to return another time to enjoy the serenity of being in Sara's place."

The apartment was in a residential area about 5 - 8 minutes drive from campus and the shops and restaurants of downtown Salem, which was perfect for me. The apartment was spacious, comfortable, quiet and peaceful. The host was very kind and gracious, and quick to respond when I had any questions or needs. She provided delicious breakfast items and fresh, organic fruit upon my arrival. I'm a stickler for cleanliness and I found this apartment to be very clean and tidy --- far cleaner than the hotel I stayed at in Portland. If you're looking for a quiet and comfortable place to stay near downtown Salem, I highly recommend this apartment. "

199568,158658201,2017-06-07,73399354,Virginia,This is a lovely place and so comfortable. Sara has thought of everything a guest might need. I just wish we could have spent more time there and with her! 
199568,160364149,2017-06-13,130082312,Lisa,"Make yourself at home in Sara's wonderfully comfortable home, surrounded by the most beautiful garden.  It is the perfect place to relax with a good book. If you don't have one, Sara has an amazing library. <br/>"
199568,161860079,2017-06-18,245162,Stewart,"My wife and I spent two nights at Sara's at the beginning of a 17 day road trip from California to Canada and back. The apartment was exactly as described and depicted in the listing. <br/><br/>At the risk of repeating other travelers' descriptions, there are four separate rooms in the apartment: kitchen, living/reading room, large bedroom and 3/4 bathroom. <br/><br/>The kitchen is well equipped and Sara goes further providing granola, coffee, honey and other useful items. Any cooking would have to be done on a two-burner hotplate. We stuck to the water boiler, French Press and microwave.<br/><br/>Modern washer and dryer were great. The queen bed mattress is a bit too firm for me but I'm 63 and fussier than I used to be. Ten years ago it would have been fine. The daybed was softer and worked well for me.Towels were plentiful and of good quality. <br/><br/>Other features we appreciated were off-street parking in the driveway, a quiet neighborhood within 10 minutes of downtown and the courtyard garden outside our door.<br/><br/>We appreciated Sara's flexibility when we arrived later than originally planned. She was quick to respond to questions and communicated clearly.  Sara is an outstanding host, both welcoming and professional and genuinely interested in making sure travelers have a positive experience. This will be our first choice for future visits to Salem."
199568,163981629,2017-06-25,13667631,Susan,"Easy access to Salem.  Beautiful, spacious, and relaxing rooms.  Excellent host."
199568,164806963,2017-06-29,44618389,Jessica,"Sara's place was very comfortable, relaxing, beautiful yard to enjoy and overall a great place to stay in the Salem area.  Many extra special touches to make it feel like home.  Thanks again!"
199568,167742545,2017-07-07,46886568,Joseph,"Perfect place for our stay in Salem. Comfortable, well-maintained, and very well-equipped space with a very quiet, private backyard patio out the door. Sara was also very warm and welcoming. I almost hate to give such a glowing review, because it may lead to Sara's place being booked the next time we want to reserve it! ;-)"
199568,169819816,2017-07-13,137550668,Harry,Sara has a lovely place and my wife and I were very comfortable there. It is a perfect location for anybody in town for a softball tournament at the Wallace Marine Complex. Easy walk if you desire. Sara is a very nice host.
199568,171130940,2017-07-16,133654917,Lindsey,We chose Sara's apartment for the proximity to family we visited.  The area is residential and quiet but not secluded by any means.  It was well equipped to eat in as well as close to restaurants and the highways.  Communication was just what we needed.  Wifi worked great as we watched movies on the iPad at night.  TV was great for the morning - my son watched KQED cartoons while he ate breakfast.  Patio was serene but we didn't get to use it much since our schedule was packed.  Washer and dryer were an appreciated perk as well!
199568,172077658,2017-07-19,2862913,Jo,"Loved the ambience with great art work all around and a beautiful garden to enjoy, plus a friendly visiting neighbor cat.  The host was wonderfully helpful and receptive to make the stay very comfortable and enjoyable."
199568,174400537,2017-07-25,43122384,Trish,Wonderful backyard. Sara had food for us for breakfast. So nice
199568,175366617,2017-07-28,74684846,Cira,"We chose Sara's place because we were visiting friends in Salem, but wanted to have our own space. We were very happy with the accommodations. My husband and I were traveling with our one year old son and, while the apartment isn't childproof, per se, it was pretty easy with a toddler. There wasn't much he could get into. The apartment was very clean and the bed was firm and comfortable and Sara is very nice. Sara left a selection of breakfast foods--some English muffins, fresh fruit, cereal, coffee, etc which was really nice so we were able to have a light breakfast before heading out for the day, rather than eating out 3 times a day. Overall a great experience. "
199568,178526315,2017-08-05,60095509,Katie,The garden apartment was just what we needed when visiting Salem. I visited during one of the hottest weeks and this basement apartment kept us cool. The garden creates a quiet retreat but you are close to lots of things to do. Sarah is on site if you have any questions. The apartment is very clean and is stocked with last minute things you might have forgotten.
199568,179550580,2017-08-07,2141591,Kathy,"Sara's garden apartment is beautiful and comfortable, the pictures don't do it justice. Sara was very friendly and helpful, once we were oriented to the space we had complete privacy but Sara was very prompt with answering texts if we had questions. Highly recommended!"
199568,182511193,2017-08-14,20867355,Gregory,"We were pleasantly surprised at how large Sara's garden apartment was. It was clean, bright, cozy, and well-kept with a lovely garden outside and a plethora of fascinating books on the shelves. Sara kept in communication with us throughout our stay and responded swiftly when there was a minor issue with the toilet. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend the place to friends."
199568,184014406,2017-08-18,17224595,David,"The space was lovely, and Sara was a thoughtful and gracious host who was quick to respond to our messages. We really appreciated the selection of breakfast foods, and the patio/garden area was nice to sit outside and enjoy during the summer evenings. The beds were really comfortable with plenty of space for us to spread out. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
199568,185840589,2017-08-22,128397737,John,"This was our first stay at an Airbnb. We were pleasantly surprised at the very clean and well maintained space. Anything you would need Sara has thought about and provided to make your stay feel like home. <br/><br/>We came down for the eclipse so spent three nights. There was plenty of space, nicely decorated with artwork. The private patio was perfect in the evening for cocktails or to enjoy the beautiful garden. The apartment is a very close drive to restaurants and night life. Sara has also put together a book of restaurant menus and reviews to help you navigate the downtown. There is a small fridge and well maintained kitchen so we were able to put together a few meals.<br/><br/>Sara was a great host who took the time to get to know us. She had many recommendations that added to our enjoyment of the time there based on our conversations. Sara's local knowledge made our eclipse viewing experience unforgettable.<br/><br/>Would definitely book here again if we are ever in Salem. "
199568,204368409,2017-10-17,85545382,Martin,Sara is an incredibly smart and attentive person. I would recommend to anyone to stay at her place. Thanks Sara!!!
199568,205275371,2017-10-21,127835262,Shirley,Sara was there to greet us and was very hospitable. The rooms were clean and well provided with items such as shampoo and other odds and ends. The one thing you need to keep in mind is to ensure you notate the security code so that you can use it when needed.
199568,217101420,2017-12-07,87089127,Hung,"Sara’s place is a very cozy place and the photos did not do the place justice. The living room has a really good fireplace but remember to wear a pair of gloves to move wood. The place is very close to get to from Salem; most stuff you might need is close by too (Roth’s grocery and the Woodburn outlets are only a 30 minute drive away). Sara replies very fast and her place has almost everything you need. The area is safe and residential and very quiet at night. So if you’re in need of a place to stay for a longer period in Salem at a very reasonable price, Sara’s place is an excellent choice."
199568,299794625,2018-07-31,196905459,Ellyn,"Peace, quiet, comfort. No hassle. Like staying at an old friend’s place."
199568,304544324,2018-08-09,119443831,Chelsea,Sara was wonderful and provided what was advertised. She made herself available and had a lovely introduction and gave us our privacy. Very good location and near active places in town. 
199568,321121355,2018-09-09,63411639,Annie,"Loved our near month stay in this garden apartment. It's spacious, comfortable with a great private patio.  Our host, Sara was pleasant and easy to contact.  We would stay here again!"
199568,322674792,2018-09-13,195025075,Mary,"Great apartment close to downtown Salem, wineries, cycling routes and birdwatching at the NWR.   Very nicely equiped kitchen, off street parking, private entrance and comfortable living space."
199568,328948838,2018-09-27,7390894,Husam,"Clean, peaceful, private, and convenient location."
199568,345350131,2018-11-04,37254899,Michelle,"Sara was very easy to communicate with, she is a thoughtful host and provided more than we could ask for. She was very accommodating and seems like a thoughtful human in general. <br/>The space is bigger than described, the bathroom is very spacious as are the sleeping areas. The French doors that open up the garden make for a very serene and peaceful morning. The library area was very comfortable for conversation and perusing a variety of books. The neighborhood felt very safe. This was a perfect end to a busy day."
199568,346194721,2018-11-07,59949655,Lynn,Sara is a great host.  This is in a quiet neighborhood in an older house. The apartment opens to a patio which would be great to use in the warmer months.  Very roomy and comfortable.  She has everything you need and lots of extras.
199568,352066861,2018-11-24,219526702,Sharon Dawn,Well worth the trip.  We really enjoyed our stay.
199568,356266922,2018-12-07,152505782,Samantha,Sara is a wonderful host! She is very personable and thoughtful. The space has everything that is needed!
199568,364955229,2018-12-31,118424264,Susie,Friendly quick response. Clean roomy space in quiet neighborhood. Bike paths to historic downtown Salem.
199568,482010084,2019-07-05,95730669,John Paul,"Sara is a sweet hostess. This space is quiet, clean and private. There are awesome walking/biking trails close by. Would stay here again if in Salem."
199568,486548127,2019-07-12,258888208,James,"Nice place located near downtown Salem, Oregon. Kitchen is limited in size and cooking options but my daughter and I planned on eating at restaurants mainly so that fit our intentions. Great host that communicated timely and gave us good advice on the area."
199568,490459394,2019-07-18,3453121,Kay,Sara's place was just want we needed for our time in Salem. It was clean and so roomy. The patio off the bedroom is so beautiful and calming. We enjoyed browsing her book selection. Sara was very helpful with information about the area. She provided tasty breakfast items for us and had several ways to make your morning cup of coffee. We will be back to stay with Sara again.
199568,492965458,2019-07-21,12397797,Desarae,"Sara's space was beautiful, roomy, and peaceful. My favorite part was the backyard garden and patio. Sara herself is personable and accommodating and even had breakfast food and fresh fruit for us when we arrived. The whole place is sparkling clean and her book collection is fun to peruse. Highly recommend and would stay here again."
199568,502509203,2019-08-04,170800060,Pamela,The place and the hospitality were superb! The BNB was lovely.  Ericka was a gracious host.  I feel as though I've made a new friend. We appreciated the patio & garden and had our meals out there.  There is a grill for outdoor cooking.  It is a perfect spot for longer stays. Full use kitchen with washer and dryer. Sitting room and two bedrooms. We really appreciated being able to stay there. We will look to stay there again when in Salem.
199568,508967422,2019-08-13,188040062,Furch,Wonderful place that it would be a pleasure to stay at again!
199568,515994040,2019-08-23,26762986,Melody,Loved Sara's place. She and her daughter were very responsive and helpful! Great suggestions for local spots to check out. Incredibly charming place!!
199568,523514617,2019-09-03,278342564,Robert,"This place has lovely décor, is immaculate, includes all the necessary amenities,  has a beautiful backyard, and is in a very convenient location.  The host is friendly and gracious. We had a great experience, and we would definitely book a return visit."
199568,525400861,2019-09-07,277175538,Debbie,"Sara’s place is a beautifully decorated little apartment full of vintage touches, and it’s extremely clean. It’s in a convenient location, and Sara is very helpful about the area. The private garden is wonderful. We enjoyed our four days there very much."
199568,532426498,2019-09-19,90092094,Kim,Very private and comfortable. Highly recommend.
199568,550922449,2019-10-19,19343002,Eric,The garden apartment is cute and quite spacious. It feels homey and is very comfortable. It is perhaps my favorite Airbnb stays to date.
199568,563420846,2019-11-12,262110281,Sarah,"Sara is a fantastic host. She provided for every need and added thoughtful touches above and beyond, like homegrown and homemade breakfast goodies waiting for us upon our arrival. She was responsive to questions and both open and available, but left us to our privacy otherwise, which we appreciated. The Garden Studio Apartment was perfect for our stay in Salem. It has some (very) minor quirks such as a small tv with limited cable, or a small kitchen (but cleverly laid out & well supplied) - nothing that was an issue for us in the least. On the contrary, it suited us perfectly. It was clean and snug, quiet and restful, with a cozy gas fireplace,  comfy plush couch, shelves full of good books and comfortable beds. We could look out upon the private garden sanctuary from the dining table, sitting area or bedroom, or better yet we could just walk out and sit in it. We would definitely stay in it again for a future trip to the Salem area.  Highly recommend!"
199568,567519379,2019-11-22,306567050,Robert,"A very beautiful space, quiet and refreshing.  Calm and soothing atmosphere. Sara is wonderful host and this will be our first choice when we return to Salem. Thank you Sara."
199568,583439650,2019-12-28,300515232,Jerry,"This is probably one of the best AirB&B's in Salem, OR.<br/>Our Host, Sara, is a great lady..makes sure all is taken care of and every detail completed. Cozy garden apt. with gas fireplace, well stocked  kitchen, large  bedroom w/patio doors to outside patio. Second bedroom and bath<br/> makes up the rest.<br/>So cozy and welcoming...we felt at home for our extended stay.<br/>Many places to go for lunch or dinner and ww were able to take our daily walk in the park close by.<br/>All was such a delightful stay!!!<br/>L & J"
199568,592311128,2020-01-12,146675859,Traci,"Sara was a great host! The apartment was clean and well stocked, and she was very responsive to messages. Sara also was willing to share information about the area and was fun to talk with."
199568,599312360,2020-01-29,281874549,Mary,"Sara's garden apt is quiet, clean,  and delightful! Sara had extra local information,  maps, restaurant menus,  and walking tours. The apt has a mini fridge and one can access a freezer in the nearby  garage. Beds were comfy and temperature was easy to control. Her place is on a pretty hill with easy walking or driving access to everything needed.<br/>I would definitely stay there again; Sara is super!"
199568,616113413,2020-03-08,229899316,Tiffiny,"Sara was absolutely amazing, very accommodating, and great to talk to when our paths crossed.  Very private, and she's very responsive.  A fuse blew during my stay in the bathroom, and she was able to get it fixed really quickly!  I would absolutely recommend her place.  Really great!"
199568,620030001,2020-03-20,219318797,Scott,The host canceled this reservation 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
199568,555170842236579363,2022-02-04,214326529,Ireen,What a wonderful and cozy place with the most kind and accommodating host!
199568,556556729151433494,2022-02-06,221385868,Josh,"Sara made us feel very welcome, was great with our 7 year old son, and her place is great!   Thank you!!!"

199568,581990845667096357,2022-03-13,434536306,Vera,"I don't know how I found this listing but I am so happy that I did. I left Texas for an 8 week contract in Oregon, first time there. Let me start by saying that the pictures don't do this listing justice. The place is absolutely beautiful, big, clean, quiet and very comfortable. Sara was such an amazing host and the Airbnb exceeded my expectations. She went above and beyond by welcoming me, walking me through every aspect of the beautiful studio, going with me on walks (after I voiced a desire to start exercising), giving me numbers of her family and friends to contact while she was on vacation, giving me information about where to get groceries, where to go for locally made bread, coffee, etc. The studio was fully stocked with breakfast items, toiletries, and so much more. The fireplace in the den was perfect for the rainy days of Oregon. The host offered to pick me up from enterprise when I dropped off my rental car. Also offered to take me grocery shopping in her car. I felt like I was at home, among family, during my time here. Sara is very respectful, friendly, accommodating, quick to resolve issues, and easy to talk to. If work brings me to Salem again, I will definitely book this place again."
199568,602173161240742692,2022-04-10,31209036,David,"We enjoyed this beautiful, clean, peaceful garden apartment this past weekend!  The kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed and many extras.  The bed was very comfortable as were the other seating spots in the apartment.  We used the outdoor space as well with a picnic and BBQ.  Sara has made the apartment and garden spot feel very homey and comfy and we plan to return on our next visit to West Salem!"
199568,610866372587298750,2022-04-22,32553809,Heidi,Sara was such a wonderful host and her apartment is so cozy. We were so glad we decided to stay there while we were in town. We would highly recommend her place to anyone traveling through the Salem area.
199568,612413703306841283,2022-04-24,221385868,Josh,We love staying at Sara’s garden apt!  Sara is friendly and the apt is great for us!

199568,621064739972783037,2022-05-06,31934793,Martha,"The Garden Studio apartment was perfect for me on an almost week-long visit to my elderly father, who lives nearby at Capital Manor.  It was just close enough so that I could go back ""home"" to eat my lunch and ""recharge my batteries"", and then head back to Capital Manor for the rest of the afternoon. On chilly mornings it was so pleasant to sit drinking my coffee next to the warm fireplace. Thank you, Sara!"
199568,623273986235686694,2022-05-09,64572419,Cameron,Super clean and cozy space. Had everything we needed for our trip. Thank you Sara and Eryca!
199568,627626693091312166,2022-05-15,172432954,Rosana,"Sara's basement apartment is lovely and clean; a good size for 1-3 people to stay. The fireplace and heat exchanger kept the rooms warm enough, and Sara showed me how to use everything. The kitchen is a little small and haphazard, but it had everything needed if you wanted to cook. You can hear the floor creaking above and the sound of conversation but otherwise it's very quiet. <br/><br/>The neighborhood is clean and safe, a short 7-min walk from some local restaurants and a market. I'd absolutely recommend for someone to stay here for a short trip!"
199568,633405885327662991,2022-05-23,241368010,Alexis,"Was a wonderful spot for visiting family. Very convenient location to store, restaurants, etc. Cozy home and beautiful yard! Sara was a wonderful host!"

199568,663779605205707985,2022-07-04,32661903,Erin,"Sara’s place is amazing and located in West Salem, but it’s an easy drive to everywhere! Sara made sure to think of everything, and even let us borrow a blanket to visit the park (a must with the rose garden). <br/><br/>I cannot recommend this place enough"
199568,666792956094178648,2022-07-08,465225624,Judith,"This apartment was perfect for the two of us on our visit to Salem. Sara was beyond helpful! I took full advantage of the lush and beautiful garden to sit outside and do a little work. My husband got some kind of pollen in his eye and had a pretty big allergic reaction;  nothing life threatening but super uncomfortable! Sara came to the rescue with an OTC allergy medicine that made him a little drowsy, but did the trick. The location was incredibly convenient to downtown restaurants and on our frequent house hunting excursions. The space is larger than it looks and incredibly clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the fireplace in the evening and we used the kitchen each morning to make breakfast. Sara also had a freezer we could access for our ice cream! This was our first Air BNB experience and Sara made it amazing."
199568,668939767643959736,2022-07-11,427214682,Chauncey,"I had a nice and quiet stay here. Its very much like a sublet except homier, which is perfect if your looking for your own space where you dont share amenities. Also, there is a nice backyard space which is packed with nice plants and feel tranquil. A lot sunlight enters the whole place as well."
199568,671754982448762190,2022-07-15,424621559,Cora Sue,"We were in Salem for a softball tournament and the close proximity to the ball field, restaurants and grocery store was very desirable. The apartment had everything that we needed and it was very peaceful and quite.  We felt as though we were in a country retreat with the view out the french doors to the patio, flowers and trees.  For those who enjoy reading, there is the library OR bring your own and enjoy the atmosphere.  Will absolutely return if we have another tournament in Salem."
199568,675418294723006233,2022-07-20,289280829,Heather,This was the perfect secluded space to stay in. The kitchen gave me the opportunity to make my own meals as I have many food allergies. The space was like a cottage in a fairy garden. I loved it! And getting to it was incredibly easy. Sara was very sweet and kind.
199568,681928477517405674,2022-07-29,38597536,Carol,"Sara’s place is very comfortable and charming. Super clean, plenty of towels and breakfast items. Sara was so friendly and helpful, very responsive. We enjoyed our stay!"

The bedding is super comfy, temperature easy to adjust, kitchen well-equipped and overall- clean and homey.  I was super glad she had a tea kettle and extra tea bags on hand.  Coffees too.  I felt very safe and secure in the sweet, hilltop neighborhood."
199568,738517181470023696,2022-10-15,431025161,Sarah,Sara provided some extras which made me feel extra welcome  — very yummy coffee and granola that I recognized as being from Trader Joes (which I generally don’t eat because I love it too much).

The property is charming, beautiful, clean, quiet, and meticulously maintained. We decided that after our stay here that we preferred this lovely carriage house over our own home.  Bill and Julie... Adopt us please!?<br/><br/>The space had been recently remodled/updated and the two crucial facets of a b&b were top notch... the bed was large and oh so comfy, the shower was spacious with plenty of pressure and hot water. Equipped with everything we needed, this room was PERFECT. Bonus points for being walking distance to Bush's pasture park where we were working for the weekend.  <br/><br/>All in all we wouldn't change a thing. Highly reccomended!"
7293821,40875407,2015-08-02,40120251,Elizabeth,"Julie and Bill's place was my boyfriend and my first ever Air B&B experience and we loved it. The place was extremely clean and well stocked with showering items, dishes, linens and some delicious fruit, granola, and iced tea. We enjoyed the patio after dinner (we ate at the littlest roadhouse) with a bottle of wine and gorgeous wine glasses. We slept so well in such an amazingly comfortable bed. In the morning we enjoyed a walk around the park and checked out some local spots in town which Julie and Bill recommended. We will definitely recommend to friends and hope to come back for more stays! Thank you Julie and Bill for welcoming us to your home and to the state of Oregon."
7293821,41493593,2015-08-07,39395123,Emily,"From the second we arrived Julie made us feel very comfortable. Every day she made sure we had everything we needed. The room was impeccable. It was exactly how it was described. Very clean and well appointed. Julie left drinks and snacks in the refrigerator (yogurt, granola, bagels, fruit). This was our first airbnb experience and we really felt julie went above and beyond to make our stay great. If we are ever in Oregon again, we will absolutely stay with Julie. "
7293821,41710929,2015-08-08,40631899,Roberda,"What a perfect little getaway nest! The hosts were so thoughtful in the appointment of the apartment and the setting was peaceful, beautiful and convenient. A lovely way to spend a night away from home."
7293821,42228111,2015-08-11,40732110,Michael,"The place was immaculate and inviting. If I had the time I would have enjoyed a longer stay here. The hostess was very kind, worked with my schedule, and has my highest recommendation to any prospective tenants. "
7293821,43821066,2015-08-22,29765753,Sally,"This was the perfect Airbnb experience for my husband and me. This is a well-loved, recently renovated home with a wonderful, private mini apartment for rest and relaxation in a beautiful neighborhood. And our host, Julie could not have been more gracious and welcoming. Fesh tomatoes and basil from her garden were waiting for us, together with homemade muffins, scones and granola, and delicious coffee from The Archive. Did I say perfect? Thank you, Julie, and next time, we look forward to meeting Bill."
7293821,44470107,2015-08-26,8919014,Kelly,"We ended up adding an additional night to our original 4 night stay. I guess that tells how we felt about Julie and Bill's place. The studio is cozy, but nicely decorated, very clean and just a very nice relaxing place to stay. Great quiet and tree shaded neighborhood and Julie may have the most nicely landscaped house in all of Salem. Did I mention Julie's scones? - To die for. We worried about the apartment getting warm being above a garage without air conditioning on hot summer days and evenings, but it was never an issue and we never even turned on the fan. Comfortable bed. Very private, but Julie and Bill are often up for a glass of wine on the patio, if desired. This will be tops on our list next time we are in Salem."
7293821,45294067,2015-09-01,6354138,Kate,"Our stay at the Chauffeurs Room was exceptional! Julie was friendly and helpful, but also gave us our space. The room was beautiful and very clean. Breakfast goodies were provided for us, even milk for the coffee! Everything was delicious! The neighborhood was very safe and lovely. In my opinion, there's no better place to stay if you're visiting Salem. Thanks Julie!"
7293821,46341983,2015-09-09,30658943,Ryan,"Julie's listing was perfect.  As I travel the country facilitating cooking workshops, I prefer the quaintness of a place that feel like a cozy home, to mentally prepare for my work.  Julie's accomodations were perfect. From tomatoes and basil from the garden to homesee granola and zucchini muffins for breakfast, these small details accented an otherwise perfect stay. She even let me harvest some fresh herbs from her beautiful garden. It was a beautiful estate that her and her husband have meticulously renovated... an obvious passion project with thoughtful details around every corner."
7293821,47448928,2015-09-18,23345328,Sheri,"Staying in the Chauffer's room was my first time at an Airbnb listing and I am sold! I can't imagine ever staying at a hotel again. My arrival time changed by a few hours and Julie waited up for me, left a bowl of pasta in the fridge (it was delicious) and met me with a warm smile when I arrived. The room was fabulous, comfortable, and exceeded my expectations. I hope to return soon!"
7293821,47682573,2015-09-21,23606976,Diana,"Our experience with Julie was great from start to finish.  She was friendly and very responsive to our messages when booking and when figuring out arrival times.  We really felt at ease about the process and about what to expect.  She and her husband greeted us warmly when we arrived and let us know the best way to reach them if we needed anything.  The neighborhood, house, and especially the gardens are stunning!  And the room was perfect for my husband and I.  It felt comfortable and spacious - it was so well designed and decorated.  The local goodies for breakfast were delicious!  Our only regret is that we had to leave quite early to meet a friend and didn't get to thank Julie in person for a great stay!"
7293821,48365036,2015-09-25,44890432,Andrea,"Julie welcomed me to her home with a yummy glass of wine and light snacks.  The room looked exactly as detailed in the listing, and really the amenities anticipated my wants before I knew them myself. Breakfast offering was great."
7293821,49188739,2015-10-01,10952700,Meghan,"Really enjoyed my stay in the Chauffeurs room. Clean, comfortable, and welcoming setup. Also in a nice neighborhood that feels safe to walk / jog in. Hosts were lovely - I arrived late and left early and they left some thoughtful notes and a snack for me when I arrived, and a healthy breakfast in the morning. Would love to stay here again."
7293821,49822711,2015-10-06,44386144,Jacqueline,Julie and Bill were very hospitable and accommodating.  Lovely new studio apartment and a wonderful historic area of town close to everything. The muffins and other treats were  very welcome after a long day of travelling.  
7293821,49990340,2015-10-08,41103070,Katie,"The Chauffeur Room was amazing! The room was clean, beautiful, and the amenities were really nice. Loved the muffins! "
7293821,50127525,2015-10-09,8903,Jenny,"Julie met me with a glass of wine and a friendly smile after I had driven  three hours at the end of a workday to Salem.  It was much appreciated!  The room was cozy, the shower exceptionally clean and well appointed and the bed super comfortable.  I also was especially impressed with the ample amount of snacks and breakfast items available for guests. Thanks for making my very short stay in Salem enjoyable!"
7293821,50631537,2015-10-13,41152412,Melissa,"This was my first AirBnB experience, and it's hard to imagine another topping it. Julie is an absolute delight and her Chauffeurs Room is beautiful. My daughter and I stayed here for one night as part of a visit to Willamette University. The apartment is located in a charming, safe neighborhood and is convenient to all that Salem has to offer. The bed is very comfortable and the apartment is incredibly clean. I really do wish we could have stayed longer!"
7293821,51048699,2015-10-17,281872,Anna,"This property is adorable, cozy, safe, centrally located, clean, well priced, and the host is kind and genuine. The home made breakfast treats she leaves in the room upon arrival are delicious. If this room is available to book for your trip, don't hesitate -- you won't be disappointed. "
7293821,52305019,2015-10-27,42239565,Annie,"The Chauffeur's Room is a sweet, comfortable place in a wonderful neighborhood!  My daughter and I stayed just one night while on college tours but would have liked to stay longer and explore.  Everything we needed was provided, with special touches like homemade granola, cookies hot from the oven and dining recommendations.  When the Wi-Fi didn't work, Julie responded immediately and restarted it.  It still didn't work for us but that may have been from our end.  We enjoyed the cable TV instead.  Our stay in Salem was made personable and easy with these hosts. "
7293821,52702674,2015-11-01,25282673,Megan,"Julie met us when we arrived. She is very welcoming, explained the key system: all very easy. The apartment is lovely as are the gardens and the neighborhood. And Julie provided delicious homemade gluten free granola, homemade gluten free muffins, juice, coffee, tea, bottled water, and almond milk. In addition the bathroom was stocked with shower supplies, hair dryer which was lovely. Highly recommend experiencing this lovely spot.<br/>"
7293821,53670964,2015-11-10,19989181,Gina,Julie was very nice considerate and thoughtful. The room set up was great. Everything I needed was there. 
7293821,54351078,2015-11-18,10952700,Meghan,"Julie and Bill are wonderful hosts, and I have now stayed at the Chauffeurs Room for my 3rd time while staying in Salem. Each time it has been a really warm, thoughtful experience, and they have been very inclusive and considerate. The room is lovely, clean, and in a great neighborhood in Salem. Fridge always is stocked with some great treats."
7293821,55162053,2015-11-28,49569931,Iona & Huib,"This was a delightful and cozy place for my partner and I to stay.  We were welcomed very warmly, and the apartment had everything we needed.  The apartment is very tastefully decorated, everything is of a  high quality.  In addition to all of this, the apartment is located in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood and downtown Salem is within walking distance.  Also, this was the perfect location from which we could to explore the wonderful wines of Willamette Valley.  "
7293821,56849817,2015-12-19,47702795,Veda,"We enjoyed our stay.  The place was immaculate and inviting and our hosts were wonderful...so warm, available and did all they could to make our stay fantastic."
7293821,57456597,2015-12-26,19845334,Nicole,"We stayed in Julie's Airbnb over Christmas Eve and Christmas while visiting family. Their accommodations were wonderful! Warm, comfortable and very clean. This was far better than any hotels we've stayed in in town. We'd definitely recommend them and stay here again!"
7293821,58360860,2016-01-02,6818358,Margot,Immaculate and very cozy place. Great attention to details making our stay very comfortable. Breakfast goodies were a nice surprise and much appreciated. We will be back.
7293821,60019930,2016-01-18,50991974,Bruce,"Julie has a wonderful and cute home that will make anyone feel comfortable and cozy on those rainy Salem days!  Fantastic neighborhood, and we won't stay anywhere else when in town.   "
7293821,61462625,2016-02-04,3551315,Stephen,"Julie could not have been friendlier or more accommodating (as example, she got me almond mill when I mentioned being lactose intolerant). The Chauffeur's Room is a great little apartment that has everything one might need. It is attached to a beautiful home in a very elegant and secluded neighborhood (the Governor's mansion is just down the street) yet only minutes from downtown. I will definitely stay there again."
7293821,61729088,2016-02-07,17249094,Anna,"We loved our stay in the Chauffeur's Room!  The space is adequate for two.  It has a queen bed, comfy chairs, kitchenette that if fully loaded with any essentials you may need for a few days stay.  The shower space is spacious although for the taller human specimens it may be a bit short.  The hosts were very welcoming and went above and beyond assisting us with our ventures.  We loved that we were ""on our own"" for breakfast, if you will.  Our room had a plate of muffins, yogurts, granola, orange juice, coffee, tea, bottled water, fresh fruit, yoiu name it. This allowed us to come and go at our own schedule without having to wait around for ""breakfast to be served."""
7293821,61871806,2016-02-08,15018426,Tricia,"As many others have attested, Julie is a delightful hostess - warm, welcoming, and responsive to all requests (since my stay was only for one night, I didn't get to meet Bill). Their home and garden is beautiful and well-kept in every way. Julie kindly dug around for a CD player and an alarm clock for me, as well as offering me a surprise lunch when I arrived. Her treats were yummy. The upstairs space is very private and quiet, with many thoughtful details. And the neighborhood is a wonderful place to walk, with lovely views out to Mt. Hood, and the surrounding hills and valleys. It's also close to many points of interest, but I elected to just stay put! Yep, this is another great Airbnb find! Thanks so much, Julie!"
7293821,62259093,2016-02-13,53950057,Mark,"Julie was an excellent host who greeted us on arrival and made sure we had everything we needed (including some delicious crumpets and muffins for our first morning's breakfast). The room was perfectly cozy and well-appointed, and wonderfully quiet and private. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the shower was great. And their beautiful villa property was just the right location for our family visit in Salem. We would definitely stay there again on our next visit to town."
7293821,62431094,2016-02-14,8694445,Rita,"Our hostess, Julie, was very welcoming and helpful regarding the room, the area's walking routes and antique stores. We loved the room. It was as described; maybe even better than depicted. Quaint, very clean, a comfy bed... and the homemade scones and granola were so delicious. We ate every last drop of both. Would recommend the Chauffeur's Room at the Villa and we hope to come back when it's warm out to enjoy the beautiful outdoor space! The property and the neighborhood are both beautiful and very close to everything!"
7293821,62907222,2016-02-18,14656873,Juan,"Great apartment as described.  Very peaceful.  Very clean.  Would certainly stay again.<br/><br/>Julie most welcoming with muffins and water bottles/milk in the unit."
7293821,63589040,2016-02-24,23143319,Kristi,"Julie was excellent with coordinating our arrival, everything was just as shown/described on the listing page, and my boyfriend and I felt very comfortable in the Chauffeurs Room.  The flannel sheets were cozy, and the bed was very comfortable!  There were cookies and muffins for us in the morning :-) Julie's home and the neighborhood in general are beautiful.  Thanks for a great stay Julie!"
7293821,63684190,2016-02-25,54597164,Christina,Everything was absolutely perfect!!!!! Great location and very private. I will absolutely stay there again! :-)
7293821,63785448,2016-02-27,50997633,Richard,"Julie has just the right personality for being a host. She made sure to be there at my expected time of arrival, made me feel like an honored guest and was exceptionally friendly. The unit is unusual, literally a former chauffeur's quarters above the garage. It's private with its own separate entrance and has everything one would need to spend a few comfortable nights. "
7293821,64288675,2016-03-02,12834577,Jill,Julie was the sweetest and most attentive host! Her home is gorgeous... Love the neighborhood. Such a nice quiet spot with all the little things taken care of. Will recommend this spot to everyone!!
7293821,65064618,2016-03-10,10177993,Megan,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was a great welcome into the Airbnb community. The Chaffeur's  Room at the Villa was comfortable, clean (which I am truly finicky about) and adorable. It was stocked with everything I needed to make my stay run smoothly. The hosts were a joy to interact with and were very organized and considerate. I will definitely be back. -- Karri E"
7293821,65449668,2016-03-13,58927757,Elizabeth,"Julie met us when we arrived and made us feel very welcome. My daughter and I were in Salem for wedding dress shopping. The neighborhood is lovely and quiet. Really enjoyed our surrounding, very quiet and serene. Julie and Bill had Breakfast items ready for us in the fridge (which is awesome) for the morning. The scones were handmade and so great! We can't say enough about our stay, it was perfect for our busy weekend. There wasn't anything that Julie and Bill forgot. They really know how to make you feel at home and yet provide a very peaceful and private retreat. Can't say enough good things about our stay. Thank you Julie and Bill!"
7293821,66257207,2016-03-20,44346844,Jamie,My husband and I enjoyed our stay very much. I wished we could have met Julie but our schedules were just off. Everything was as described and every comfortable. The neighbor was kind and curious about where we were from. It feels like a home away from home for sure. Very private. 
7293821,66646274,2016-03-23,17891763,Sally,"All my thanks, Julie and Bill, for a warm and welcome stay at your Chauffeurs Cottage.  It was just the experience I was looking for!  All the extras were truly appreciated, and I felt pampered!  I hope we will stay in touch!<br/>Sally"
7293821,69402575,2016-04-11,33521912,Jill,"Julie and Bill are very welcoming and wonderful to interact with. And Julie is ridiculously adorable as a host. I show up to a gorgeous property and find an infectious smile and sunny disposition, am shown a very clean and tidy room looking just like the photos, and find homemade cookies and a welcome note as we thought I might arrive when they were not home. Love that. She made sure I knew she was available if I found myself in need of anything at all, then took her leave so that I could get settled in. <br/><br/>I start looking around and find: a glass container of homemade granola with a banana for me to have for breakfast. Hmm...I'm going to need milk, so I look in the fridge. Yep, there's milk. Plus yogurt, bottles of water and orange juice. Julie, you rock. I don't drink coffee or tea but I notice some of that lying around too. <br/><br/>Other unexpected things I found: Adult coloring books and colored pencils, travel and lifestyle books, board games, an oscillating fan, portable heater, portable stereo w/cd player, clothes drying rack... she really does have it covered, in my book.<br/><br/>Omg. And the bed. That delightful fluffy cloud of a bed. Bliss. Well, for me, anyway. We all have different needs when it comes to a bed.<br/><br/>I could go on but you're probably tired of reading at this point so I'll wrap it up with: Enjoyed my stay, was pleasantly surprised, exceeded expectations, charming hosts, would recommend to anyone, and will definitely and eagerly stay here again.  :)<br/><br/>Ok I lied. One more thing: the neighborhood. Filled with beautiful historic homes. Including the one you are staying at. I went for a walk to explore and you should too, its a great neighborhood. It is a bit hilly, though, so that might be a challenge/hinderance to some. A nice bit of fitness for others. I straddle the line on that one, but it was worth it.  ;)"
7293821,69533095,2016-04-11,61933595,Randy,"We had a great time.  The room and the neighborhood was beautiful with lots of mature landscape and blooming flowers.  We did not get to meet Julie until we were ready to leave, but her communication was excellent and we had no problems getting settled and were very comfortable.  When we are back in the area, we will try to stay with Julie again."
7293821,69848738,2016-04-14,66236485,Rb,"This was the most superior lodging experience I have had (and I travel for work often).  Everything about the stay was perfect and, if you enjoy beautiful architecture and stunning landscaping, you're going to love this place (the photos cannot do this place justice)."
7293821,70217610,2016-04-17,4913888,Borrego Surf Club,"The only place to stay in Salem! The neighborhood and house are goregous.  Julie, the Owner, has great taste and has made the small space very comfortable and cozy. You can tell she loves hosting, as she left my wife and I fresh baked muffins and granola for breakfast. Every last detail was thought of and we could not have been happier."
7293821,70623164,2016-04-19,29485922,Karen,"Julie was a lovely host. She made us feel very welcomed. The room and bathroom are beautifully appointed and everything you could ever need was provided including great homemade muffins. We really appreciated the good quality shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion. There was also plenty of off street parking right outside. We cannot recommend the chauffeurs room more highly."
7293821,71132308,2016-04-23,66569512,Air2016,"Perfect!  My wife and I stayed for two nights while visiting our daughter at college. Very comfortable. The room was well done with modern conveniences but retained the charming character of the house. We highly recommend it. (Oh yeah, the muffins and granola was delicious "
7293821,72182384,2016-05-01,20035862,Rick,"This place is very cute and has everything you need. The neighborhood is so gorgeous and quiet, the main house is truly a Mediterranean mansion, and the hosts are so friendly and accommodating. I'd stay again for sure."
7293821,72886027,2016-05-05,27295425,Melissa,Nicely appointed apartment. Very comfortable. We enjoyed a nice walk to The Kitchen for breakfast at Julie's recommendation. It was a lovely neighborhood & a wonderful rest on our I-5 journey.
7293821,74927307,2016-05-17,64037107,Chad,"Julie made Sue and I feel warmly welcomed and even had fresh baked muffins out for us with homemade granola and a few other things in the fridge - this kid of attention make all the difference in a world of options. She is kind-hearted and thoughtful. We can't say enough good things about her:) <br/><br/>The Chauffeurs Room at the Villa is beautiful and the grounds are stunning - it a great neighborhood to walk or stroll our newborn! Highly recommended place to come for a few days or a few weeks, as we did! "
7293821,75934865,2016-05-23,64037107,Chad,"When we arrived Julie had bottles of water out and homemade granola and muffins for us, not to mention a few goodies in the fridge. The neighborhood is beautiful, the gorgeous homes and friendly people were a big bonus for us. We had just adopted a baby girl, Aya! and were in need of lots of stroller time and the neighborhood was perfect. Julie is kind hearted and very thoughtful and willing to always go the extra mile for her guests - we felt at home at the Chauffeurs Room, and highly recommend it to anyone heading for Salem for 1 night or, as we did, 16 days! Julie is fabulous, can;t say enough good tights about her:) "
7293821,76343665,2016-05-26,9060596,Tom,Beautiful alternative to Salem hotels.  Everything you need to have a home away from home.  We will be back :)
7293821,76845837,2016-05-29,67822796,Jeff,we arrived in Salem for our stay and were immediately impressed with the neighborhood. beautiful homes each uniquely different on wonderful lots. julie was working planting flowers in her yard. she was very responsive to all our communications. she was expecting us and graciously showed us to our quarters. the space is very well equipped with most things that one would need. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. we were close to downtown area and could easily go in and out to other places. she had some wonderful muffins and other food to start the day. we only were able to stay 2 days but could easily have stayed longer. will definitely visit again if in the area. <br/><br/>thanks jeff and shirley
7293821,78372728,2016-06-06,47392499,Will,"We enjoyed a wonderful visit with Julie - she is quite gracious.  The weather didn't cooperate - it reached 101 in early June - but we had a lot to do in the Salem area.  Wonderful restaurants and we rode our bikes on Minto Island - very close by.  The place was so private - surrounded by trees.  We would enjoy staying there again for sure.<br/>"
7293821,79822910,2016-06-14,68015877,Andrew,The spaces was a wonderful relaxing getaway while in town for a weekend. The grounds and property were stunning!
7293821,80737410,2016-06-19,35525348,Benjamin,Julie's place is amazing. She was an excellent host! We would love to come back next time we are in Salem. 
7293821,81909413,2016-06-25,63024702,Lorin,"This is a cute, functional place on a beautiful property with a nice garden.  The hosts are so welcoming and friendly.  The neighborhood is one of the best in town, filled with older, elegant homes.  You can walk to a nice, quiet park with a playground - it's several blocks away and as mentioned, the neighborhood is really pretty."
7293821,82085986,2016-06-26,16815579,Nancy,"We were fortunate to find this little gem available for our stay in Salem. The location is in a wonderful, quiet neighborhood but only a few minutes from downtown. The hosts made us feel very welcome from the first minute we arrived. The apt was private, clean and included all necessities we could possibly require.  The shampoo and soap products were wonderful, and the bed/bedding was the best I've ever slept in! Fresh fruit, granola and Almond milk awaited us for our breakfast.  I would highly recommend this cozy studio for anyone looking for a quiet and relaxing stay."
7293821,82982621,2016-06-30,53841437,Dave,"As our first AirBnB experience, it was truly great. Our hosts (Julie and Bill) were very welcoming, and the apartment was quite nicely appointed and well-suited to our needs.  It sat on top of the garage and was private from the rest of house.  Julie surprised us with a delicious treat for breakfast-- freshly picked blueberries from her garden!  "
7293821,83208112,2016-07-01,24331494,Nancy,Fantastic hosts.  Extremely clean and darling accommodations.

7293821,84524853,2016-07-07,21172075,Mike,"Julie was a great host and supremely nice.  The property itself is a guest house above the garage with it's own entrance so you can come and go as you please without disturbing anyone.  The neighborhood is adorable and very quiet and pleasant.  You're about 1.5 miles from Downtown Salem so easy access is had to everything you might need.  We used Salem as a base for exploring wine country and this location served us perfectly.  I'd highly recommend staying here if you need a spot in Salem with one caveat; this space is not great for tall people.  I'm tall and had to crouch the whole time.    I'd hit my head in the stairwell, the room, the shower, and the bathroom.  So, if you're over 6'0"", you've been warned.  "
7293821,84774807,2016-07-09,7893880,Stephanie,The Chauffeurs Room was charming and had everything you would need! Julie was very friendly and accommodating! We highly recommend staying here.

It is quiet, charming, decorated with style, and perfectly maintained with everything we needed (hair dryer, shampoo and soap, coffee, refrigerator, microwave, wifi, slippers, and even an ironing board and iron--we were going to a wedding so that was handy!). The garden is gorgeous, and this is a beautiful neighborhood, just minutes from downtown by car. The owners are wonderful. Thank you for the treats!  They were perfect for the morning so we could take our time getting ready for the day. "
7293821,85900418,2016-07-13,81959439,John,"Julie and Bill were very sweet people to meet. Their house is tucked away in a historic neighborhood of Salem. Everything was very clean, neat, and well kept. The accommodations are comfortable and access to the place is easy and the environment of the inside and outside are calm and quiet, which is welcomed during business travels. "
7293821,88891914,2016-07-25,8205995,Richard Or Rose,Julie and Bill were both very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed meeting them both. The apt was very clean and very comfortable. The space was well planned and appointed. I am only sorry my wife did not get to stay this time.  Hopefully she can next year. Lovely setting with outside sitting area and Julies lovely garden. Thanks for a great stay.
7293821,89246371,2016-07-27,81959439,John,"Such a great place to stay, in a nice quiet part of town, that's easily accessible. Julie is a wonderful host. "
7293821,89434550,2016-07-28,19418386,Lynn,"Wow!  Julie was a really great host and her house (and apartment of course) are gorgeous.  Julie went out of her way to be available and helpful. She gave us ideas about places to eat and  go for a morning run.  She also gave us lots of interesting information about the history of her home. In addition to all this, the shower in the apartment is simply the best ever.  We definitely enjoyed our stay!!<br/>"
7293821,89711159,2016-07-29,79182391,Victoria,Julie was great!  Awesome experience for us as first time AirBnB visitors.
7293821,90587463,2016-08-01,19092989,Anne,"Julie's place was just perfect!  Everything you need- super comfortable bed and lovely calming space.  Her garden is beautiful.  I was really just there to sleep so did not explore Salem.  Shower pressure great, toiletries provided.  Yummy muffins for breakfast.  She was very flexible about all arrangements.  Would stay here again for sure! "
7293821,91257152,2016-08-04,85505691,Carrie,"My family and I had a fantastic stay here. The Chauffers Room was perfect for us and it even came with delicious muffins, granola, and coffee. The room is so beautiful and clean and the grounds all around their home are idyllic and relaxing. We felt so welcomed and at home. Julie gave us perfect recommdations for places to visit and things to do. We loved staying here and will definitely return again. I recommend it for anyone looking for a beautiful and relaxing place to stay with kind, warm, and welcoming hosts. "
7293821,91723587,2016-08-06,10102069,Nicholas,"Julie personally greeted us upon arrival and was most welcoming.  The Chauffer's room was comfortable and well appointed. Julie and Bill seem to have thought of everything a guest would  need, right down to slippers and homemade granola. A wonderful stay! "
7293821,92665623,2016-08-09,81905306,Blair,"Our stay was nothing short of wonderful! Julie was so welcoming from the moment I stepped on the grounds of her home. The room was so clean and had everything we could ever need (from a microwave to a fridge, extra blankets and pillows, to all bathroom necessities). I highly recommend staying here; we are actually already booked for another stay with Julie and Bill. Such a beautiful home with amazing and kind hosts!!!"
7293821,92897173,2016-08-10,81492111,Andie,"Located in an upscale, quiet neighborhood, Julie's home was a perfect stay for us in Salem. Like the cutest B&Bs, it's beautifully appointed, designed and decorated with every detail considered. We were very comfortable there and wouldn't hesitate to return!"
7293821,93551771,2016-08-13,642445,Christine,"Julie was very welcoming and helpful. The room itself, is modest in size, but totally comfortable with everything I could possibly need. And it was the prettiest room I ever stayed in too, looking like it had been put together by an interior decorator. I loved the colors, art, and high quality bedding. And there were unexpected niceties, like milk, almond milk, butter, and bottles of filtered water in the frig. Though the room was small (but not uncomfortably so) it is part of a large estate that is absolutely gorgeous. As a guest, I was invited to enjoy the grounds. This home is located on top of a hill, in a lovely, leafy, neighborhood. It was very quiet at night, and I felt very safe there. It is only a few blocks from a main street which can either take you directly downtown to a concentration of shops and restaurants or away from downtown to many other shops and restaurants in strip malls. For dinner, I ended up at a natural foods store nearby where I got a wonderful meal from the deli. The next morning I shopped downtown at Macy's, Penney's and Ross's for clothes. So even though it is a quiet residential location, it is very  it is a convenient location for dining and shopping."
7293821,94052968,2016-08-14,4965941,Barbara,Very lovely apartment with all the amenities. Our hosts were gone for the weekend but their communication was great.  There is a beautiful yard and garden for enjoying a sit down before heading out for the evening.  Very very nice neighborhood.  It was nice to have a large fan as it was quite warm this weekend.  The shower was the best!  
7293821,95755170,2016-08-20,33876600,Shirley,"Very cute little apartment in a very quiet neighborhood in Salem.  I was a bit curious about what a ""Chauffeur"" Room meant.  It is literally above the garage, so sometimes you can smell the gas/noise when one of the car's enters/ exits.  "
7293821,96073402,2016-08-21,71965882,Louise,Julie was so welcoming and understanding that our arrival was delayed a few hours.  We kept in contact via text about our delay.  She was peacefully waiting for us on her front porch when we arrived.  And she had iced tea ready us.  This home is located in a beautiful neighborhood of established homes and trees.
7293821,97446712,2016-08-27,81959439,John,"Nicer than any hotel room in Salem, for a better price and wonderful friendly people. "
7293821,97831564,2016-08-28,67663091,Susan,"We loved our time in Salem and the Chauffeurs room was the perfect place for us to stay. Julie is a thoughtful, friendly, and welcoming host. Her home is only a few minutes away from the downtown area but is amazingly quiet, calm and peaceful. The room is clean and well decorated with all the amenities one would need and and even a few extras provided by this gracious host. Thank you Julie!"
7293821,98382123,2016-08-30,29868894,Mary,"The Chauffeurs room was a charming, small apartment above the garage unit.  It was very well appointed and Julie the hostess was very welcoming. The main house is quite beautiful as were the mature trees and the quaint garden. My only regret is that we couldn't stay longer to explore the historic neighborhood and city and relax on the beautiful patio with a glass of wine.  I look forward to our next visit and would definitely stay with Julie again ! "
7293821,99330458,2016-09-04,20781383,Geri,"This property is located close to downtown Salem in a beautiful historic neighborhood.  The apartment was very quaint, and comfortable.  The hosts were very friendly and gracious.  Our stay was enhanced by their thoughtfulness.  We loved our stay and would consider staying here again ."
7293821,100708176,2016-09-10,70066155,Valarie,"We had such a wonderful stay in the Chauffeurs room Sept 3-10... the room is so cute and cozy, and is equipped with everything you need. The bed is comfy, the shower is hot and has great water pressure. Julie is a super special lady and we had some great conversations with her...even got to meet her adorable grand-daughter during our stay. We weren't in the room very much, as we chose to spend the majority of our time time exploring wine country, the coast, and the mountains. But coming back every night was like coming home. Julie is so sweet and accommodating, we really, really enjoyed our stay. We'd definitely book here again if coming back to the area. Thank you so much!"
7293821,102154345,2016-09-17,89870457,Lenore,"This was awesome! Julie has thought of every detail! I felt like I was at home! This is going to be my ""go to"" place in Salem...book now, you will love it!!"
7293821,103591909,2016-09-23,28481247,Mandy,"Julie was the kindest host, checking in to be sure I had everything that I needed, leaving freshly made muffins, and assuring that my stay was better than expected! The apartment was adorable, and comfortable and the perfect escape for a relaxing moment. As I overlooked the beautiful gardens and took in the falling rain, I felt as if I were in a dream land! Julie had prepared far more than I could have expected in terms of breakfast items, tea, bathroom necessities and sweet momentos. The experience far surpassed any expectations! I would recommend this location to anyone and am wanting to go back! "
7293821,104317599,2016-09-26,81548050,Doug,"Julie was friendly and helpful between our booking and arrival and during our stay.  The refrigerator was stocked with breakfast basics,  homemade granola, cookies and coffee on the counter.  The room is beautifully appointed with a breakfast counter and walkin closet."
7293821,105178649,2016-09-30,7648106,Rebecca,"Julie was an amazing and attentive host. Her home is beautiful, so comfortable and welcoming. The breakfast options were home made and delicious. Before I arrived, She responded to all communications within a few hours. During my stay, she was always available; there was a great combination of friendly conversation and giving me my privacy. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Salem. Highly recommend!"
7293821,105695323,2016-10-02,43049568,Melinda,"Julie was a wonderful host. She made everything very comfortable and went out of her way.  And while I stayed in her lovely home instead of the Carriage house because the shower repair wasn't quite complete, it more than exceeded my expectations. Julie was in touch during the week preceding my visit so there were no surprises.  I would definitely return. "
7293821,106181284,2016-10-04,66537202,Andrew (Andy),"It was a wonderful experience staying with Julie!  Although the Chauffeurs Room wasn't available, I stayed in a beautiful room (the Maid's Quarters) in the main house.  Julie and her husband have done a exquisite job of renovating a turn of the century house in a quaint neighborhood of similar large, older, and well kept homes (including the governor's mansion).   The room was very well appointed with a very comfortable bed and an on-suite. <br/><br/>Julie is the consummate host, always finding just the right balance between being helpful and recognizing your need for privacy.  She was very quick to reply to my request (which I made on the same day as I was seeking accommodation). She even texted me when I forgot an item at the house and offered to mail it to me (fortunately I was still in town).  I am looking forward to staying there again when I am next in Salem!"
7293821,107496676,2016-10-10,89870457,Lenore,I was back for another week!! Julie is the very best host in Salem!! My stay was just as perfect the second time!!

7293821,110815141,2016-10-28,81959439,John,This is always my first choice when I stay in Salem. Julie is a fantastic host and I think the decor And linens are different every time I stay. And that's coming from your typical non-observant male.... 
7293821,111292752,2016-10-30,6746674,Jayme,"This suite is absolutely perfect. It's cozy, Julie has thought of everything you might need while you stay, it's design is absolutely gorgeous, and the location is great. She went above and beyond to make us feel welcome! P.S the cupcakes were yummy :) "

Our accommodations included a comfortable bed, television, dishes, tiny kitchen (fine for us),  nice sized refrigerator, tea, coffee, granola, fresh baked zucchini bread, closet with room to hang clothing and a nice  private bathroom.  This accommodation is located in a beautiful area of Salem and we enjoyed exploring the neighborhood on foot when we had a chance."
7293821,114102505,2016-11-15,99435412,Carrie,"This was my first experience using airbnb. It was a great experience. Our host Julie was so sweet. When we arrived (early, I might add) she had the most amazing carrot cake muffins for us. Seriously, the best muffins I have ever had. The chauffeurs room is decorated so beautifully. It also has everything you need. Plenty of comfy blankets, 2 heaters. She has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable. The property and neighborhood are so beautiful. Julie was quick to respond to any questions that I had. It was such and great trip to a beautiful house and a beautiful city."
7293821,115571778,2016-11-25,78179542,Syl,"Julie showed us to our room, turned on the heat, gave us a list of restaurants to go to, made sure we have coffee, sugar, and milk, orange juice, and left us some cookies. The place was very clean and smelled clean. It was also quiet. "

7293821,116688715,2016-12-02,51317834,Pheebs,Adorable little chauffeur's room above the garage in a fantastic old neighbourhood with a real historic feel. Julie had fresh baked bread for us upon arrival and check in could not have been easier. I'm usually pretty antsy about cleanliness and I did not hesitate to touch anything. The bed linens and bathroom were super clean. The entire place was welcoming and cozy. Very quiet at night and none of the points of interest I went to was more than a ten minute drive away. Will definitely stay again next time I'm in town. Would definitely recommend!
7293821,120325580,2016-12-09,81959439,John,There was plenty of room to practice my nunchuck and bow staff skills. I would recommend this stay for any ninja practitioner. Probably one of the best places to stay in Salem ever!

7293821,127481656,2017-01-18,15927282,Sybil,"Julie was super nice and welcoming. The property is simply gorgeous, and must have some fascinating Salem history I'd have loved to learn more about. The apartment was lovely and cozy and warm in the midst of a winter storm, and is very private and quiet. Wonderful extra touches - yummy granola and fresh milk for breakfast, some delicious cookies as a welcome, and wonderful cozy bedding.

Easy to find, in a lovely, quiet neighborhood, I couldn't have asked for better. Highly recommended as a ""home base"" for anyone traveling in the Salem, OR, area! "

Is above the old carriage house (now a garage) and has a fully equipped kitchen, flat screen TV and great internet service (I had to work quite a bit and never experienced any problem at all).    The bed was incredibly comfortable and we were toasty warm during the chilly nights.  Wonderful goodies in the bathroom to take care of any shower needs and really terrific hair products.   The location is VERY convenient to Willamette U - for all you college parents, it is a perfect place to stay while visiting your student, close to downtown and the U.  The neighborhood is gorgeous and I'd live there in a heartbeat.  Totally enjoyed our stay."

Julie put my mind right at ease from the beginning with her quick responses to my questions before I had even booked the room. Julie accommodated me in every possible way, with little added surprises along the way. The room was very clean, and had everything I needed and more. The bed was comfortable, and the shower perfect. Julie leaves no stone unturned when stocking the room with your needs. The neighborhood was safe, upscale, and very beautiful and scenic. Julie's home is absolutely gorgeous, along with all the other homes in the neighborhood. It was secluded and serene, but just minutes or walking distance from the main street. I would never book anywhere else when visiting Salem but here, if Julie will have me. I without a doubt, highly recommend this room if you want to stay at a place that is your home, away from home, and literally is a little piece of heaven !"

She has a wonderful flower/vegetable garden that is lovely to walk through, and there is a picnic table to sit and enjoy the beautiful surroundings.  The entire area of Fairmount Hill is stunning, full of well kept historic homes and cottage gardens.  The room was very clean and well furnished and there is a small kitchen area so we were able eat in some nights.  There are many good restaurants within a couple of miles.  We felt at home in this setting and recommend the Chauffer's Room to anyone.  "

It's one of those rare places that's even better than it looks in the photos. The neighborhood is quiet, the property is beautiful and the hosts are friendly and wonderful. I'll definitely aim to stay here again if I ever need a place in Salem. I can't recommend their place highly enough."

7293821,178027855,2017-08-04,12299610,David,"Cozy, comfortable, beautifully decorated and extremely well equipped former chauffeur's quarters on a restored 1920s villa in a lovely residential neighborhood in Salem, OR. Our hostess was extremely caring and made sure we were comfortable during an unusual heat wave. She left fruited ice tea and cold watermelon for our arrival. A very nice welcoming touch. We would stay here again without a doubt. A+++!"
7293821,178555763,2017-08-05,79139746,Natalie,"What a beautiful place! Located in a quiet, gorgeous neighborhood in Salem. I was traveling solo and felt very safe. Beautiful space made for a good nights rest. Would highly highly recommend!"

Julie's home and grounds are pleasantly landscaped and relaxing. The small apartment itself is above a garage and has a fun attic feel of sorts. Best features include lots of windows, feeling like you're sleeping in the treetops, the pebble floor of the shower, and the handy little kitchenette."
7293821,182041570,2017-08-13,29127692,Patricia,"We were very comfortable here. This space had everything we needed/wanted, was a great place to stay when exploring the Willamette Valley wineries!

The studio isn't big, but it's well appointed and has everything you need. Plus the property was very peaceful. We sat outside admiring her garden a couple times during our short trip. I highly recommend this place for a couple looking to make Salem their hub."

This place was so charming and comfortable - situated in a lovely older neighborhood close to downtown.  Julie was terrific and so welcoming.  It felt like you were staying in a European flat!

This place certainly spoiled us!

Once I moved my bag into the house Julie even brought me a tasty/refreshing drink.  It was a fabulous treat making it easy to settle right in for the night. The house was exceptionally clean and comfortable.  The bed was very comfort with plush bedding.  It was a busy trip, but I truly appreciated coming home to a relaxing place stay. Thanks again!!"

I would highly recommend Julie's place and plan to stay there again myself.

It is clean, thoughtfully appointed, centrally located, and convenient to many nice places to eat. Your host is warm and welcoming. You will find her highly responsive with answers to questions and help coordinating your arrival. She is also forthcoming with recommendations about the area, if you need information or guidance. The apartment is situated behind a handsome house in a gracious neighborhood of elegant older homes and gardens-- very beautiful-- and very convenient to downtown Salem. An excellent value.

The space is clean and well-lit and there are plenty of thoughtful touches throughout, including Julie's homemade granola! This would be a great choice for anyone wanting a central location in the Salem area and a quiet environment (with your host close by if needed)."
7293821,226442952,2018-01-10,66537202,Andrew (Andy),"We rented both the Maid's Room and the Chauffeurs Quarters.  What a unique B&B!  Set in a century old house, the rooms gave insights into early 1900s life in Oregon.  HOWEVER, the real key to our stay was Julie.  It would be hard to find a kinder, more empathetic host!  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to our next visit.  All the usual stuff -- comfy bed, clean, lots of hot water, good cooking facilities. <br/><br/>It was better than going to stay with Grandma!"

7293821,286229515,2018-07-05,77976080,Angela,Julie was an amazing host! We wanted to go to the 4th of July fireworks and she kindly provided a blanket for sitting on at the park. She greeted us upon arrival and had cookies waiting for us. The neighborhood and her home are beautiful- we would absolutely stay again!

7293821,288827320,2018-07-10,12118834,Amy,"As we were driving up to the house the first thought that came to mind was “Oh I’d love to live in that house!” And OMG the place is so freakin unbelievably cute! Inside, outside, the manicure grounds plus the usage of the patio and gardens. It’s like a house out of Beverly Hills. The neighborhood is absolutely gorgeous, quiet, clean, and safe! Definitely a small price to pay for a piece of paradise. The accuracy of past reviews drew me to this place. <br/><br/>We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and Julie’s hospitality. I loved that she showed us the suite barefooted. Since for me I’ve accustomed to leaving shoes at the door. The bed is super comfy with it’s high end ensembles. I hope that one day she’d consider her home a bed and breakfast she has all the magical touches and feel to operate one."
7293821,290067020,2018-07-13,42787260,Layne,Julie was a friendly host and her place was just what we needed.  My wife and I were in Salem for a conference so we had little time to enjoy the beautiful landscaped gardens and patio but that would have been wonderful.

7293821,291886982,2018-07-16,3629152,Wilma,Comfortable quiet everything  you need. No air conditioning BUT how often does it get to 95 degrees in Salem also the fans provided helped a lot. Neighborhood was fun to walk around and see historic homes
7293821,294186557,2018-07-21,20946428,David,"This is quite a wonderful alternative to a hotel.  It's located in the heart of one of the most desirable neighborhoods in Salem (a half a block from the Governor's Mansion) and on an amazingly beautiful property.  The unit itself could be called a ""carriage house"" as it's above a portion of the three car the garage.   It is a bit small (maybe 300+ sq. ft.) but it has windows on three sides and the gardens are fabulous.  I'd take my coffee in the morning (a beer in the early evening also) and sit out in the gardens reading my book.  The outdoor aspect of this property was just marvelous!   And it's very centrally located as well.  For about the same price as the very average hotels next to I-5 (I've stayed at several of them) there is no comparison.   "
7293821,296893462,2018-07-26,71492882,Emily Jane,"I always try to stay at Julie's if it is available when I am in town. It's perfect for work travel. Julie provides fresh milk, a cookie, granola, and even had kept the room nicely cool for me on a hot day. It's in a nice neighborhood and very peaceful! "
7293821,297324142,2018-07-27,128888515,James,"It is in a lovely location, in walking distance of several places to eat. Julie’s house is beautiful and we enjoyed sitting in her garden. The room is compact but very clean with a lovely shower and all amenities that you need."

7293821,303622401,2018-08-07,13230659,Amy,"Apartment above the garage - it is the coziest, cutest unit that has everything you need! Very comfortable for a smaller space with a studio feel - bed, 2 leather chairs, micro kitchenette with coffee pot and granola and cookies / pretzels. The bathroom is beautiful - all white tile and spotless. Extras like lotion, eye drops, shampoo / conditioner and soap is all there. The closet has plenty of space to hang clothes, has laundry basket and ironing board. Plus your own refrigerator which Julie thoughtfully puts milk and water in for you. The courtyard outside the house is amazing, as are the gardens and the pergola covered in grape vines. You can really relax here and interact as much or as little as you like. I’ll stay no where else when I return to salem. :)"

7293821,305099651,2018-08-10,13875019,Tim,"Julie’s place was in a very nice neighborhood.  The house and grounds are beautiful and immaculate.  The space is small, but she made good use of it.  I was especially fond of the grotto-like tiled shower.  My only caveat would be if you are a sleeper who needs cool air, and the nights are especially hot, as the place does not have installed A/C.  This did bother us, however.  Julie is a very gracious and helpful host, who I definitely recommend."

7293821,319198771,2018-09-05,29392944,Kimberly,"We were fortunate that the Chauffer's Room was available for a last minute stay in Salem. The room was lovely.  We slept well in a cozy bed with soft linens and  pillows.  The bathroom was nicely tiled, great shower, and all the necessary amenities.  This small space had everything we desired.  For breakfast we had the most delicious granola, fresh grapes from the garden and coffee.  Julie's garden was in full bloom and she was a gracious and friendly host.  We enjoyed a relaxing reprieve and hope to return again some day."

7293821,338169157,2018-10-18,141893260,Sue,"We had such an amazing stay at Julie and Bill's apartment. The space is totally private, with your own entrance, immaculately clean, super, super quiet and a wonderful oasis in Salem. The gardens are gorgeous and we really enjoyed sitting outside and having a glass of wine, early evening, just enjoying the greenery. We absolutely loved the neighborhood. We enjoyed walking around and exploring - but it was great to be able to walk downtown, with close proximity to lots of restaurants and all that Salem offers. <br/>Julie and Bill are fabulous hosts -- if we could give them 10-stars we would. Loved all the personal touches they add to the experience. Baked goods when you check in, homemade granola, coffee and tea to start your stay and all the lovely soaps, shampoos and body lotions. Plus.... a comfy bed to die for! Top-notch linens, towels and everything you'd expect to experience in a 4-star hotel. All-in-all a fabulous stay and we would strongly recommend this gem to others. <br/>Thank you Julie and Bill for such a lovely stay!"
7293821,339653760,2018-10-21,9241849,Stefan,"We stayed at Julie's place for a night and had a pleasant experience! Their home is located in a cute neighborhood of Salem, half a block from the governor's mansion. The room we stayed in, the Chauffeur's Room, is in a detached unit behind the house with a separate entrance with plenty of privacy. Julie met us when we arrived and was super-friendly and gave us some tips for restaurants and bars to check out. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was well-stocked, and didn't run into any problems. We look forward to coming back here again!<br/><br/>Thanks Julie!"

The design of the room was so well thought out that it felt bigger than it actually was and everything a person needed was supplied. Julie was very welcoming and made me feel at home right away. The main house and gardens were beautiful and historic. The location is great! Downtown, the State Buildings, Willamette University and the Willamette River were all close by. I tried a couple of recommended restaurants and they truly were fantastic. <br/>Stay in the Chauffeur ‘s Room when you go to Salem!"

The bed was very comfortable and kept us very warm, as did the heaters. We were able to go do our errands for the day and come back to a private and peaceful environment. The only thing that could have been modified was the shower as it was a bit small and awkward for my fiancé who’s about 6 feet tall, however the water pressure was amazing! Overall, we loved our stay and would definitely recommend Julie’s place for anyone looking for a home away from home."

I can't say enough about her VERY comfy place, from the amazing bed (best bed I've had of all the many places I've traveled), the big amazing walk-in shower with the best water pressure, the beautiful neighborhood (and it's quiet), to the little treats she left in the studio including the homemade muffins and sourdough bread! It's 1 flight of stairs up to the studio, so if stairs are an issue, that would be my only hesitation. I can't wait to return! Thank you Julie (and Bill, her husband)."

Her and William’s home is amazing.  And the private quarters seems like a quiet, special hideaway from the state’s capitol, even as the Governor’s mansion is nearby.  We didn’t use the A/C even though it was August, but the room didn’t feel stuffy with the windows and fans.  Bed as comfy as could be.  Super quiet.  Loved the little treats Julie presented.  Would definitely recommend!"

The owners responded promptly to all inquiries and our self-check-in was flawless.  The quiet neighborhood is lovely and very convenient to the city.  I realized after our first night that the intermittent sounds I had been hearing were the acorns falling from the large oaks onto the roof adjacent to the windows, which we had open."

Julie and her husband, Bill, were so kind and thoughtful. Julie really went the extra mile with making the space feel cozy with sweet, thoughtful touches like breakfast foods, coffee, tea, yummy sourdough bread with delicious jam! My partner and I felt very relaxed and welcomed and appreciative of all the effort put into this space! I only wish we could have spent more time chatting with them had conditions of social distancing not been in place. Very grateful for the warm conversation we did get to share! Very kind souls for the weary traveler :-)"

The outdoor patio is adorable and the perfect place for morning coffee or a night time drink, it is very private. The neighborhood is also great with lots of historic homes to walk and look at, very safe too. Julie was excellent at communicating with us and even had some items for breakfast prepared and two cookies upon arrival. Would rec this place to family and friends any day!"

As others have said, the bed is super comfortable and the shower is amazing (I didn’t want to get out!), but beyond that, it’s all the little touches that make this suite special. From the baked treat that was left for my arrival, to the extras like granola, honey, milk and raspberry jam. Bill and Julie are both very friendly and welcoming and their property is gorgeous. Looking forward to staying again this week."

There was fresh bread and granola along with other organic breakfast offerings. The bed was super comfortable and the room was very clean. A few things to note, there is a steep staircase leading to the room and the shower has a very low ceiling and entrance-I had to duck to get in it at 5’5”."

This was one of the best places I’ve stayed. <br/>From the beautiful property to the baked goods, this place is better than a nice hotel. <br/>Clean private room (and I’m picky.. it was spotless), quiet, nice hot shower with great water pressure, did I mention the baked goods?!? Gave recommendations for local food, met us and chatted a bit and gave me tips for bread baking! Everything about this place was amazing. Would definitely stay again."

The neighborhood is peaceful and is only a short drive from downtown Salem.  Julie was very neighborly, offering us slices of freshly baked sourdough bread and some cookies when we first arrived!  If you want a calm place to stay while you enjoy what Salem has to offer this is what you’re looking for!  <br/><br/>Small thing worth mentioning:  The room is compact and parts of the ceiling, particularly in the bathroom, have an angle which can make it slightly challenging if you’re a tall person.  Again, the room is very cozy and has all the essentials but if you’re especially tall this Airbnb may pose some challenges."
7293821,469592242394859566,2021-10-09,101303441,Amir,Julie was an incredible host and her space was exactly what I was looking for. Hope I can stay there again soon!

The studio apartment over the garage was sparkling clean, bed was comfortable and the kitchenette was well stocked. There was enough room for two people but no more than that. Julie left us homemade muffins that were outstanding and homemade granola as well as coffee and tea. The studio does have A/C that worked well on 95+ degree days in Salem. They also allowed us to store our bikes in their garage instead of keeping them on the back of our Jeep. Quiet, beautiful neighborhood and very convenient to the center of Salem. Julie provides information on local restaurants and other things to do in the area. Highly recommend."

Everything is wonderful in this cozy studio: a shower with good water pressure (and amazing Oregon water!), a comfortable bed, spotless new kitchen, and the nicest host in the world. <br/><br/>Hotel options in Salem are generally mediocre anyway, so I’m delighted to have found this is luxury for less than a hotel room!

I stayed 2 nights at this place for photographing solar eclipse, which was an amazing event. but my soul was enriched and received more than that,  Nancy's warmness, kindness, sincerity truly made me felt like family while I stayed there.  Her communication was always right on, she did extra mile effort to make sure I was comfortable at her house.  Her cooking was awesome and delicious, plenty of food, fresh fruit, Zen garden, quiet environment, friendly nice neighborhood.  I really enjoyed this stay so much.  I will give 10 stars on all category easily.   Nancy, Thank You so very much for all you'd done.

8524259,276419627,2018-06-13,24919674,Barbara,Nancy's place is lovely and modern. ..well appointed and a great location.  Nancy was very hospitable and sharing.  You need to provide your own breakfast but that's not a problem as a fantastic supermarket is very close.  Great host...great stay.
8524259,750826626,2021-04-21,51814961,Hilda,Nancy was very generous with her beautiful home. Her home was extremely comfortable especially the bed. I slept quite well while there. She made 2 lovely breakfasts during my week stay. If I was to visit Salem again there would be no doubt in my mind to stay at Nancy’s home again. I give my stay there an A+
8698684,57531025,2015-12-27,35248426,Ryan,"Our stay in Christy's home was wonderful. This home is an inviting and comfortable home with oodles of charm.  The front covered porch allowed us to enjoy the evenings relaxing even in the winter. The cats that belonged to Christy's tenant, hung out with us on the front porch as well. The home was newly remodeled on the inside with the exterior in the process of being completed. Christy had setup a beautiful Christmas tree that was enjoyed over our holiday stay. The restroom has a charm just like the rest of the home, with a claw foot tub and shower, a little bit to get use due to shower curtain surrounding you. The kitchen was nicely appointed with everything you would need to make a meal.<br/><br/>Christy was a wonderful and attentive host, very quick in responding to my questions about the house and the surrounding area. The neighborhood was quiet and a few minutes drive to downtown Salem. We found a great breakfast place close to the house called The Word of Mouth Bistro. A must visit, just be prepared to wait, as this restaurant can get busy but the bloody Mary's and coffee are worth the wait! Christy provided us with a list recommendations of places to eat, drink and visit in the area that was very helpful. We never got to meet Christy personally but I feel like I know a little about this world traveler. A very gracious host and a charming older home set in a quaint neighborhood, we will stay here again the next time we are in Salem."
8698684,62139416,2016-02-11,2357190,Magz,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8698684,64245889,2016-03-01,57972634,Tom,"I had a great long weekend at Christy's house: perfect for the quiet retreat I was looking for. Just as advertised: cozy and recently renovated inside, work still going on outside, but I didn't mind that, and I look forward to seeing how it turns out. Roomy and comfortable, and Christy was welcoming, flexible, and helpful with suggesting local highlights. (The Word of Mouth breakfast was as good as advertised.) And the location is ideal: a low-key residential neighborhood a short, pretty walk away from the train station and downtown Salem. I'd be happy to return. "
8698684,64900879,2016-03-08,26342198,Will,"Super friendly host, very welcoming and accommodating. Great location, very close to downtown Salem. Front porch is awesome space to kind of feel like you're outside, but you're still protected from the rain. I look forward to renting the house again in the future."
8698684,65610362,2016-03-15,57928847,Katie,"My husband and I stayed in Christy's house and it was great! Her home was cozy, clean and in a convenient location in Salem. Christy was easy to communicate with and made our stay very relaxed! We would definitely stay at Christy's again!"
8698684,68480996,2016-04-05,18926880,Enola,"Our stay at Christy's home was very comfortable. We had everything we needed. The outside of the home is still a bit of a work in progress but the inside is lovely with many charming artistic touches. The backyard was serene, it was enjoyable to hang out under the flowering fruit trees. The neighborhood is quiet but still within walking distance of all necessities including a charming Farmer's Market. I would definitely recommend this home when visiting Salem or surrounds."
8698684,69495570,2016-04-11,41458732,Kristian,"Had a great time staying at Christy's place, it fit exactly what we needed. Nice quite neighborhood, within walking distance of downtown.  "
8698684,71328550,2016-04-24,5551741,Annah Taft,"We really enjoyed staying in Christy's Salem house.  It was spacious, and we really liked the funky cool interior colors and decor.   We used the kitchen to cook dinner for friends.  And as advertised, WOM is just a few blocks away - an easy walk."
8698684,77013473,2016-05-30,29197765,Rohit,"The place was as described, and although we were there for only one day, we enjoyed the stay.  Christy opened her home to us and made us feel welcome.  As stated by Christy, the outside of the house is being renovated, but the inside presents well and quite comfortable.  I would recommend it for the warmth of the host, the quiet neighborhood and proximity to the centre of town, walking tracks etc. "
8698684,79367166,2016-06-12,46039172,Jared,Christy was great to communicate with and the house worked great for us. The cherries in the fridge from the tree out front was a nice touch!
8698684,82072040,2016-06-26,1705668,Laura,"Christy is a wonderful host! Together we were able to figure out some last minute snafus with our schedule of arriving and getting into the house, and she was both understating and flexible. Four of us stayed two nights so that we could do the PetalPedal bicycle ride in Silverton. Her home is great, beds comfy and the claw foot tub a dream after a long bike ride!  The house and the backyard are a project of love for her, and are both lovely and vibey by Oregon standards. Our friends are musicians and really hit it off with Chad, the downstairs lodger, so we had a superb night of built in entertainment. Christy's recommendation of the bottle shop and  Word of Mouth were big hits. Sunday morning at WOM was certainly one of the best breakfasts we have ever had. We love AirBnB because it gives us the ability to drop into a new place and neighborhood. We will definitely look forward to next years ride with a stay at Christy's! "
8698684,83566680,2016-07-03,65534700,Stephanie,"We came down for a wedding and we were so glad we stayed at Christy's house. It was close to where we were going, spacious,  and the back hard was super cool. We would stay there again."
8698684,84039666,2016-07-05,16913653,Maureen,"Although we did not meet her, Christy was in contact with us during our stay and made us feel very welcome.  We loved the house and neighborhood.  The furnishings were very comfortable and it felt like home.  The backyard was a nice place to hang out in the evening.  We wish we could have stayed longer."
8698684,90533132,2016-08-01,27362271,Hannah,"Super cute house with amazing backyard. The garden/pool/fire pit was by far the best part, we could have stayed out there all weekend! The house was close to bars/restaurants so we could walk everywhere and Christy was very responsive and prompt. We enjoyed everything about our stay and would definitely stay there again! "
8698684,92195432,2016-08-07,80488850,Kelly,Christy's home is comfy and cozy. The backyard was just the spot after weeks of work on sons wedding. 
8698684,93521477,2016-08-13,59645751,Erin,Christy's house was great! We would stay there again!
8698684,94121633,2016-08-14,13891648,Anna,"The house is charming and clearly in transition per Christy's description. Her vision for the space is evident, and her personality shines throughout.<br/><br/>Though we visited Salem on one of the hottest days this year, Christy provided several fans to make our stay more comfortable and the backyard was a lovely place to visit and cool off in the evening.<br/><br/>We would definitely stay here again and recommend Christy's place to other potential guests."
8698684,104295756,2016-09-26,91988448,Antoinette,"Great communication! This comfy home is very close to downtown, Willamette University and the State Capital. Christy is delightful to work with, and is fixing her adorable place up to make it even more adorable. Would be perfect for families visiting their kids at Willamette."
8698684,108773070,2016-10-17,47073887,Maggie,"This has to have been one of the most warm, easy-going, relaxed home-away-from-home feeling venues we have ever stayed in. It was clean, colorful, and cozy. Christine met us, explained a few things, and left our little family of four to enjoy our weekend together. Nice neighborhood, great location, and a host who definitely knows how to pay attention to detail."
8698684,113761411,2016-11-13,97708616,Aimee,"Super quiet little house, very cozy. Cute home in progress but you can see it being worked on. Terrific value with four people! Christina was lovely to work with."
8698684,114920422,2016-11-20,52990288,Kate,This is a beautiful home. Christina was very friendly and helpful. The neighborhood was quiet with lots of neat things to walk to.
8698684,115707169,2016-11-26,13070202,Tarak & Divya,We enjoyed our stay at Christina's place.  It was very convenient for our trip to Salem and this warm and inviting home had a lot of character!  It was great to be able to walk around the neighborhood and even walk to some restaurants and breweries.  Loved the gas stove and oven for heating up meals and warm drinks.  Thanks!
8698684,123113534,2016-12-27,29163584,John,A warm and comfortable home. I highly recommend

8698684,157833099,2017-06-04,79248535,Kimberly,"Very comfortable home.  We were traveling with my three year old granddaughter.  Furnishes were sturdy, nice and comfortable, but not so fancy that we were constantly worried that she would damage something.  The bathtub was amazing for me -- what a wonderful soak -- but did present a challenge for bathing the little one, as the tub was so deep it was hard to get her in and out.  If you have a little one, the large kitchen sink might be a better bath choice.  "
8698684,159685516,2017-06-11,119051878,Lynette,Charming and comfortable. Neighbors were very friendly. Quiet street. Very close to Dutch Bros. A great place to unwind and relax after our day of family activities. 
8698684,162122474,2017-06-19,117312021,Nilsa,"Three words to describe this place: unsanitary, filthy and dirty. I was amaized by the poor condition in terms of cleaning and clutter. Bathroom sink didn't drain, had mold and toothpaste all over including mirror. Toilet had yellow ring inside bowl. Bad, bad experience!"
8698684,185474909,2017-08-21,9926921,André,"Had a good stay during the eclipse. Backyard was perfect to enjoy it. Price went up for the eclipse week-end but that was the rules of the game.<br/>Very pleasant and welcoming attentions were waiting for us in the house, it felt like arriving in a friend's place with everything you need handy.<br/>We would have appreciated to better undestand that the backyard was shared with lower level tenants before arriving. But everybody was nice and easy.<br/>We had a very good WE."
8698684,221505717,2017-12-26,151470502,Keri,"Beautiful hime, tons of room to enjoy your stay."
8698684,223708720,2018-01-01,26874962,Ben,Good place a 5 months<br/>Minute drive from downtown Salem. It's a nicely upgraded Craftsman home and very cozy.
8698684,238438164,2018-02-25,68870152,Steffani,I was extremely happy with my experience! I loved Christina’s home. Everything was clean and there was plenty of space for all of us. I would absolutely recommend this home!

8698684,249182659,2018-04-01,14736159,Kristen,"Cozy, charming home. Just as advertised. Perfect spot for us with three teens. Everyone had their own bed and space to stretch out. We enjoyed being able to walk to breakfast (Word of Mouth is a MUST) and check out the state capitol. Great backyard to enjoy the weather. Just what we needed!"
8698684,256371493,2018-04-22,178069394,Shelby,Great place to spend the weekend at.

We were able to check in early, much appreciated. I absolutely loved the home. So much character, thoughtful details to make it homey and comfortable, a great space overall. My kids are already asking to go back! The location is also excellent! Close to everything, yet removed from busy streets. We will definitely be returning on our next trip to Oregon!"
8698684,264771871,2018-05-14,7291241,Karen,a lovely old home in a quiet part of town close to downtown.  Very comfortable with a huge backyard. Christina was a great communicator and was very nice about our flights being delayed and changing plans and trying to coordinate six of us getting there and leaving.
8698684,270187742,2018-05-28,84296332,Harris,"We all (including our happy hound Goose) felt really comfortable staying here, and would do it again."
8698684,273021104,2018-06-04,115573554,Mileah,Nothing less than amazing. A great value with amazing communication. This is definitely one of the best experiences my family has ever had with a vacation home. I would definitely recommend this home and host again to anyone.
8698684,273601566,2018-06-06,23786214,Mary Anne,Christina's place is very comfortable with everything you need. The beds were good. The neighborhood is quiet. Christina and Alex responded promptly to our emails.
8698684,275244311,2018-06-10,182268354,Arijan,"We had a lovely stay at the Craftsman for our college reunion! The location is walkable to the Willamette campus and several nice local restaurants, some of which were pretty nostalgic spots for us. (The giant French toast at the Sassy Onion hasn't gotten any smaller in the last ten years!) Christina was traveling during our stay, but she went out of her way to keep in touch and make sure we checked in safely without any issues.<br/><br/>The house itself is cute and homey, with plenty of helpful instructions set out to help you settle in (although we never did quite figure out the entertainment center). The mattresses are a bit hard, but other than that, it was a delightful place to stay with lots of personality and charm. And you can't beat the value!"
8698684,282239135,2018-06-26,76677626,Christy,"Super cute house with plenty of space to spread out! My kids loved the chickens, and the fire pit was great! Thanks for a great stay. "
8698684,283396292,2018-06-29,4940969,Cheryl,Christina's place was the perfect spot to stay for our visit to Willamette University.   It was only a few minutes away from the school and a short drive to the downtown area with a variety of shops and restaurants.   If you get a chance walk to the local restaurant Word of Mouth.   It is worth the wait!   We loved the frames in each room with instructions and helpful tips.    Any time I contacted Christina she was quick to respond.   If we are in the area again we hope her place  is available for future stays.
8698684,284645692,2018-07-01,25743127,Aylene,Christina's place is a great house for a family to see Salem and have their own space! Close to many things and lovely backyard.
8698684,285830620,2018-07-04,55613346,Julia,Cute home in Salem.  Very well stocked kitchen and close to a grocery store.  We loved the front porch and all the books!

8698684,288813802,2018-07-10,17736294,Ricardo,"My girlfriend and I had an excellent stay at Christina's house. It was very comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet. If we were to stay in Salem again, I would definitely book Christina's house! "
8698684,290602175,2018-07-14,33649668,Sean,We enjoyed this space very much. Quite clean and welcoming. Lots of cozy places to relax. We played board games and looked through the books on the shelves.

8698684,292345304,2018-07-17,182322253,Robert,Quaint and comfortable home. Convenient location to downtown Salem and to Willamettte University. Christina is a great host and quick  to respond to any questions you  may  have.

8698684,297330880,2018-07-27,817555,Wendy,"Christina's Craftsman home is a treat for those who can appreciate a comfortable, 100+ year old home.  It is a small museum of very touchable antiques.  The luxury sheets on the bed were superb, the middle bedroom had an amazingly comfortable bed.  The kitchen was well stocked if you planned any significant cooking, even a French press coffeemaker and coffeebean grinder.  While their recent upgrade to Nest style controls for the air/heat mystified us, Christina could immediately adjust it remotely using her phone.<br/>The location is quite close to historic downtown and good restaurants, quite walkable.<br/>One word of warning, the side and back stairs leading to the back yard are not recommended for those with translocation issues, no railing, and if you need to use their washer/dryer, it is down in the basement.<br/>Thank you Christina, for all your thoughtful touches and quick responses.  Hope you enjoyed the California oranges and homegrown tomatoes we left for you."
8698684,302622138,2018-08-05,170599873,Tricia,Easy to get comfortable. Super cute older home with lots of character. 
8698684,304534510,2018-08-09,111021516,Allison,Christina’s home was perfect for my work trip. My husband and dog also stayed at Christina’s house. It had amazing AC and entertainment options. We felt secure letting our dog in the back yard because it is fully fenced. The bed was comfortable too! I will definitely stay again whenever the need and opportunity arises again.
8698684,305665881,2018-08-11,143165565,Michelle,"This beautiful home is charming and cozy, and surprised us with modern amenities for being an older house. Great place to relax..

The hosts checked in on us throughout our stay and were very helpful. We loved the warm and cozy feeling which was perfect for the holidays. We were traveling with our dogs and they were very accommodating of our dogs as well! They have a nice yard and well equipped kitchen so we were able to cook meals. They also provided tips on things to do in Salem. Christina and Arnaud are very thoughtful hosts and we will definitely return if we visit Salem again!

It was like living in the past seeing the great historical homes that are being cared for.....the TREE'S are beyond compare.....We had a very nice time there....."
8698684,470941660,2019-06-16,81169289,R,"This house is quaint, comfortable, and extremely quiet and worked perfectly for my family's needs. Christy was communicative and kind. Thank you so much Christy and Arnaud!"

8698684,498390451,2019-07-29,132498917,William,"This place is accurately described as a charming craftsman bungalow on a quiet, shady street. It also has a huge back yard, where we had a few very pleasant meals outside. Although the center of our activities was in McMinnville, the drive from Salem was short and lovely and posed no problem whatsoever. In fact I would guess we were happier in Salem than we would have been in McMinnville. C and A were perfect hosts in every way."
8698684,504480874,2019-08-07,8367938,Heike,The house is decorated very tasteful and nice. We didn't miss anything and liked the well-equipped kitchen. The yard is very big and there's always a shady place available when it's hot. The neighbourhood is very quiet and close to central Salem which makes it easy to discover the region. <br/>Christy and Arnaud are wonderful superhosts. The communication with them worked very friendly and quickly. We met Christy and Arnaud once and it was great to get to know them personally. We would recommend the house anytime! Thank you for hosting us in your wonderful historical house!
8698684,512823896,2019-08-18,77139003,Christopher,"Great place in the heart of Salem, we loved that we could get anywhere in town within 10 or so minutes. It was great place to have our dogs with us to and the backyard was plenty spacious for them! Having fresh eggs from the chicken coop was fun and unexpected. Then the fire pit was a great place to end every night! Check in and out were easy and we found great directions in the house for anything else we needed."
8698684,516662560,2019-08-24,15937946,Monica,"What a great space. My family and I were in the area for a wedding at a local winery. The place was comfortable and big enough for us all to relax, cook meals both inside and out. The kitchen was well stocked. We would definitely recommend this place to others."
8698684,523088916,2019-09-02,29793865,Beth,"This was an amazing long weekend! The house was exactly as described, but the back yard was not! We LOVED the backyard, the grill, picnic tables and hanging lights! We enjoyed our local pinot and had an incredible time!"
8698684,530456615,2019-09-15,127375232,Amy,"Very cute home and the perfect location! We used this home as a go between for our wedding eve and wedding night and everything was perfect! <br/><br/>It’s a little older of a home, but they did a wonderful job making it modern and the way they style it made it feel very<br/> home-y! <br/><br/>Will definitely recommend them!"
8698684,551987267,2019-10-20,8188411,Cheryl,"Great location and wonderful hosts.  This house is very nice and close to downtown,  great breakfast  place,  Word of a Mouth, within walking distance."

8698684,629689965,2020-06-14,87679448,Volha,Very cute home and great location!
8698684,635765961,2020-07-07,228108686,Patrick,Christy and Arnaud’s place really is a charming old craftsman house with lots of wonderful details.  They really took the time to make sure ours was a pleasant stay.
8698684,640178000,2020-07-19,333061561,Philip,We all loved Christy and Arnaud’s home. It truly has “rustic charm”. We traveled as a family of five and there was plenty of space and comfort and the outdoor areas are a bonus. Definitely would stay here again and definitely recommend it to anyone visiting the Salem area.
8698684,505115141917654824,2021-11-27,79553059,Shirley,Christy and Arnaud were great communicators. We loved the plants and location of the home. Thanks very much!
8698684,622473582674978103,2022-05-08,6308836,Ruth,Lovely home an easy walk to Willamette’s campus. Fresh eggs and a great snack basket made us feel at home. Very comfortable beds.
8698684,628339239967396943,2022-05-16,63314690,J,"As described, the house is a charming old place full of travel information and artifacts.  Wish we had more people and warmer weather to use the house to its potential with all the rooms, the pool and backyard.  Very convenient quick drive to downtown Salem / Willamette University."
8698684,648565961989173304,2022-06-13,17526066,Axel,This is a lovely property within close proximity to several attractions. Great for families!
8698684,663801317335194422,2022-07-04,143204406,Cor,"Amazing host. Amazing house. Amazing details. Amazing character. Amazing plants. Amazing books. Amazing curation. Amazing bed. Amazing black-out curtains. Amazing piano. Amazing yard. Amazing fire pit. Amazing neighborhood. Amazing q-tips (seriously, when was the last time an airbnb actually provided q-tips…or chocolates or tea or eggs or…). This is a shining star in the dulling sky of airbnbs. Quite possibly the best one we’ve ever stayed at; felt like home. Walkable to everything. Thank you Christy and Arnaud!"
8698684,668920113861212001,2022-07-11,41283540,Julian,"We were in town for the half Ironman triathlon. In our group was myself, my wife and our two young adult kids. Christy’s place was wonderful and met all of our needs and much more. The kitchen was very well equipped with everything we needed for cooking (oils, spices and even some basic staple items). We enjoyed a couple of fresh eggs each day to supplement what we brought with us from the “gals” (2 chickens) out in the back pen. Having laundry facilities was a god send. The ac worked great. And Christy also left a care basket with lots of yummy treats to welcome us. Great place! Hope to return again!"
8698684,676126537017005464,2022-07-21,100594143,Angela,"This place is amazing. A shady back yard with BBQ, a pool, chickens, a comfortable area to sit and chill. The kitchen is very well equipped, and you can cook nice meals here. It's very quiet and conveniently located. The hosts are friendly, they gave us a bottle of red wine and chocolate as a welcome gift! We'll be back!"
8698684,686253744230698767,2022-08-04,7130361,Amy,This IS a charming home in which to spend some time in Oregon. It is in a quiet neighborhood and feels very homey. The backyard and front porch only add to the appeal and cozy vibes of this home.
8698684,795017850345418498,2023-01-01,86406142,Nicholas,"Christy's home was absolutely perfect for our stay in Salem. It is a cozy, spacious, and beautiful home,  located close to downtown Salem which was perfect for me as my family owns businesses there that I was visiting. Check-in was smooth and Christy was super thoughtful and easy to reach throughout our stay. My two chihuahuas were very comfortable and loved the huge back yard. <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this beautiful home if you are in the Salem/Keizer area!  10/10"
9238563,55161636,2015-11-28,49558614,Matthew,"My wife, son, and I visited this lovely apartment on Thanksgiving Day. We were actually the first to stay with Steven and Robin. Based upon our visit, I expect many more visits to come both from us and from the AirBnB community. Lovely space, well priced, no hassle, and great hosts. What's not to love? We look forward to visiting again!"
9238563,56013039,2015-12-07,8448060,Gabrielle,Steven and Robin were wonderful hosts and we greatly enjoyed our time in Salem. Their house was clean and lovely. They even left little chocolates for us. Great stay!
9238563,56518669,2015-12-14,48634128,Megan,Great experience! The apartment was very well stocked and tastefully decorated. Robin and Steve were very accommodating and communicative. Would definitely stay again. A++
9238563,56801504,2015-12-18,42923296,Georgi,"We were visting my brother in Salem and it was also my 22 year old granddaughter's birthday.  Although our visit was short it was quite nice. The space fit our needs perfectly.  We even took advantage of the sauna tucked away in the laundry/bath area.  At first we were quite chilly, but per our host's instructions we texted him and he upped the heat.  Then it was quite comfy. They provided some coffee and oatmeal for the morning.  They also have a piano which we tried our minimal repertoire on.  Their floors were lovely and came with numerous caveats about getting them wet.  I imagine they wish they had installed something less beautiful and more durable."
9238563,57063577,2015-12-21,15942198,Joe & Jean,"John greeted us after a long day on the road and showed us the spotless and very comfortable accommodations on our arrival.  Their suite has all the expected conveniences AND a super-inviting sauna (that, unfortunately, we didn’t have the time to enjoy). If you like a Tempurpedic mattress (not just the pad-over-the -mattress kind) you’ll sleep well here! We enjoyed talking with John and Robin and our short stay at their home on our trip moving our daughter from San Francisco to Seattle. Highly recommended."
9238563,59919469,2016-01-17,51443039,Lara,"Steve and Robin are kind, respectful and a sizable if you need them. Sauna is very relaxing. Beautiful, quiet home. "
9238563,61174986,2016-02-01,51443039,Lara,"Felt like I was I my own home. Safe, beautiful neighborhood close to everything but also quiet. You will not find kinder, more respectful, caring people than Steve And Robin. Apartment has beautiful patio and sauna in your private bathroom. Thank you for everything Steve and Robin. "
9238563,61860826,2016-02-08,12621220,Arlene,"After reading many discouraging hotel reviews, we turned to Air bnb and found Steve & Robin's place.  It was as all of the other guests had written.  Very clean, quiet, and we were free to come and go as we pleased.  We briefly met Steve who kindly invited in for a glass of wine, but then our dinner guests showed up so we left.  We are sorry we didn't get a chance to visit with them more.  We didn't make use of the sauna, but maybe next time.  Very spacious.  We will most definitely stay with them again, and hopefully this time, we can visit with them more.  "
9238563,62474477,2016-02-14,693453,Ariana,"This space was awesome - we LOVED the sauna after a long night of helping an artist friend put on a food event at a local winery. The mattress is firm, high-quality memory foam and it was super comfortable! As stated, this Air B&B is located in a neighborhood, so we did hear a dog barking in the early morning. The space is completely separate from the living space of the owners of the home - it's located underneath their house, so we did hear footsteps once or twice, which was no big deal for us. When we arrived there were breakfast burritos in the freezer, a wine bottle opener, sparkling mineral water, and thick, fluffy towels in the bathroom. Also, a small dish of chocolates! Very well-appointed space, and the hosts were really kind, cool people. Since it's on the West side of Salem, it's closer to the wineries located in the area then other places located in the Salem area. All in all, a great experience, and we will totally go back there if we ever need a place to stay in Salem!"
9238563,62664263,2016-02-15,2357190,Magz,Beautiful sweet space. We weren't there long but Steve and Robin were friendly and their space was inviting! 
9238563,62939059,2016-02-18,9407895,Jack,"Steve and Robin were at the place when we arrived and what a sweet couple they are! There were some welcome gifts and breakfast supplies ready to go. The apartment is very comfortable, great bed and bedding, and a sauna that was a real treat. Whilst Steve and Robin maintained our privacy, they let us know that if we needed anything, they were just upstairs (we didn't but it was nice to know). All in all, a delightful stay in a very nice apartment in quiet neighborhood close to downtown. Perfect, and many thanks!"
9238563,63327358,2016-02-22,15944865,Tanja,Robin and Steve made us feel welcome from the very start. They contacted us ahead of time giving us access info. They have a beautiful home. Very clean and details for comfort were thought through.
9238563,64122623,2016-02-29,58292702,Shane,"I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Steve and Robins' listing! From the start to the finish they were very good as regards timely communication, making me feel very comfortable about where I would be staying. This was my first Airbnb stay, and it was a good experience. And this listing is larger than I had imagined it would be. It's very well maintained and kept superbly clean! I felt very comfortable and most importantly- safe. If I ever need to stay in Salem again, I'd love to stay here-and this time enjoy the sauna! "
9238563,64428522,2016-03-04,6063586,Barbara,"Steve and Robin were very kind.  They brought by some delicious decaf and homebaked muffins one morning and even provided a blender for making smoothies!  Communication was good and they made us feel welcome.  The rooms are very spacious, and the bed in the bedroom was comfortable (the sofa bed not so much, beware).  Despite the description, there isn't a kitchen, just a microwave and a small frig, so I wouldn't plan on preparing any food.  Currently there isn't really a cozy spot to hang out and read a book, have a glass of wine, play a game, or just enjoy some conversation -- just a couple of bar chairs at the bar and two couches with no tables or reading lamps.  But this could easily be remedied with a little furniture rearrangement and the addition of a reading lamp, a coffee or end table, and an armchair to the love seat."
9238563,64791726,2016-03-08,51964219,Cheryl,We enjoyed our stay in Steve and Robin's lovely suite. It was clean and comfortable. Communication was clear and prompt anytime we needed anything. We would love to stay again the next time we visit Salem.
9238563,65300652,2016-03-12,52189395,Ashanti,"The space is in a downstairs area below the main house where the hosts stay.  With the layout of the house, we were presented with a very spacious and cozy feeling living space, and we also felt a great sense of privacy.  The space is well complimented by the nice hard wood flooring and the sauna was a nice touch to unwind after a long day.<br/><br/>The room is nice and spacious with the bed offering a warm and cozy night's rest.<br/><br/>The bar style counter with bar stools was a nice area to do work in the middle of the night with excellent lighting.<br/><br/>Having this visit be a quick one night stay, we didn't have much time to interact with the hosts, but they definitely made us feel very welcome and were easy to reach through text messaging.  Before checking out, they came an  introduced themselves making the experience more personable and greatly appreciated."
9238563,65814213,2016-03-17,57673441,Tanya,"GORGEOUS suite, perfect location for Salem and surrounding areas!  Steve and Robin have provided everything you could want and the sauna is icing on the cake!  Privacy galore, but Robin and Steve were readily available for any questions.  We needed something sent from home and they went out of their way to assist!   5 stars!"
9238563,67882909,2016-04-01,57640927,Bryant,"We enjoyed our stay here in West Salem. The house was as described and we were welcomed with sparkling water and chocolate. Shampoo, soap etc. was offered in the bathroom. Coffee, breakfast and tea was offered as well. Robin and Steve were really nice to us and took my girlfriend to church, while I was working. Thank you for a pleasant stay! We might be back this summer "
9238563,68586283,2016-04-05,40340667,Mike,"This place was fantastic. The directions for getting in were spot on, there was a nice welcome sign with candy for us. Steve and Robin came down to meet us and brought a bottle of sparkling water. Breakfast was provided. Fantastic stay. Thanks!"
9238563,68708358,2016-04-06,23833586,Bob,"What a great space!  Well cared for with lots of little touches (Keurig coffee pods, chocolates, etc.).  Steve and Robin made us feel very welcome and take pride in being good hosts."
9238563,69030971,2016-04-08,22930869,Russel & Jenna,"This space was the perfect R&R place for us-clean, cozy & quiet! We loved the sauna and kitchen addition. The location was ideal to downtown and we would recommend this Airbnb location to anyone! We will stay here again for sure."
9238563,69535933,2016-04-11,26326604,Stuart,Fantastic place to stay. Beautiful part of Salem and the house was nicer than advertised. You can't go wrong. 
9238563,71131765,2016-04-23,13453657,Robin,We were greeted with a welcome sign in the rental upon arrival. The neighborhood is very quite and accessible. The hosts were gracious and provided breakfast foods for our convenience. They were extremely responsive to emails. The unit looked as described in the listing. I would have no problem recommending this location to other renters.
9238563,71180167,2016-04-24,16479868,Michael,"The room was clean, well appointed and welcoming, thanks.  "
9238563,71899862,2016-04-29,52830360,Heather,"Great little apartment close to the freeway, but not too close. We only stayed one night but it was a great experience ! Beautiful home with a nice, clean, roomy apartment attached. We had the opportunity to have a nice chat with Robin and she was delightful! I would defiantly recumbent this apartment for anyone looking for a luxury apartment to stay in, but still nice and cozy. "
9238563,77165774,2016-05-30,20832959,James,"First off - me and my girlfriend were traveling from Seattle, and had spent a couple nights in Portland before getting into Salem for a wedding at 3pm.  We contacted Steve and Robin about the possibility of checking in a little early seeing as how usually check-ins aren't until 3 or 4pm.  They were prompt and responded quickly and let us know that if the previous guests were leaving early they would do their best to have it ready earlier.  5 stars for customer service alone!  We were in luck and the previous guests had checked out early, so Steve and Robin let us know right away that they would have the suite ready for us when we arrived in at 2pm.  This saved us a lot of trouble, and put our minds at east so we wouldn't have to be frantically getting ready as soon as we arrived.  <br/><br/>Robin greeted us upon arrival and showed us the Suite, which looks even better in person.  She was super friendly and even wrote a welcome note laid out with chocolates and a stocked breakfast bar.  <br/><br/>Couldn't ask for more hospitality, stay was superb all across the board.  Great location, only a 10 minute drive to Zenith vineyards where our friend's wedding was.  <br/><br/>Thank you Steve and Robin!"
9238563,77905836,2016-06-04,41970246,Kristina,"Steve and Robin met us when we parked, and were warm and welcoming. Their home is beautiful, on a tucked-away street. The lower level is yours and it's updated, tastefully decorated and relaxing. They left breakfast burritos, oatmeal, tea and coffee, and some chocolates for us to enjoy the night and next morning. The sauna is lovely, soap/shampoo, towels are provided, and the bed was very comfortable! I would definitely come back to this peaceful, deluxe location. Thank you Robin and Steve!"
9238563,78194591,2016-06-05,2818190,Steve,"The hosts were wonderful, as was the space. The neighborhood was especially nice with the listing being on a quiet & lovely flower-filled block. "
9238563,79092197,2016-06-11,73871997,Diana,"This is a lovely little downstairs suite in a quiet neighborhood. Steve and Robin showed us in and made us feel right at home. The information says they provide ""necessities"" like shampoo and soap, but there were so many other little things that made this place special, like being greeted with chocolates and sparkling water, and the yummy breakfast burritos and hot chocolate in the morning, and the fancy soaps and comfortable bedding. We highly recommend the location and the hosts! "
9238563,79731835,2016-06-13,33314569,Kathleen,"We spent three nights at Steve and Robins lovely room. Our son was graduating from OSU in Corvallis and we were welcomed with a sign congratulating him. Very thoughtful! The room was so clean, spacious and comfortable! It was just like the pictures that were posted. One surprise that I enjoyed was the little garden sitting area just outside the sliding door. A great place to drink some tea or read for a while.  They had everything we needed and it was decorated beautifully, especially the bedroom and bathroom. We had an extra day after the graduation so we took their suggestion and drove to Silver Falls State Park. That was a highlight of our trip and was only about an hour away. We really enjoyed our stay in Salem!"
9238563,80099468,2016-06-16,66571827,Anne,"Steve & Robbin are really nice people and were very interested in us (where we come from, where we planned to go to). We were very welcome to use their house en would come back again !"
9238563,80811040,2016-06-19,10513864,Jonathan,"Steve & Robin were very accommodating and their apartment was exceptionally clean and comfortable for our family of four. We especially enjoyed the sauna during our three-night stay. The kitchenette includes a sink, microwave and flatware and allowed for making simple meals. A brand new grill awaited us on the patio which we made great use of. We would definitely stay here again!"
9238563,81021745,2016-06-20,76461195,Daniel,Steve and Robin were awesome and great host. They made us feel right at home and their place was absolutely beautiful. This was my first time using Airbnb and was blown away with how easy and great of a home this was. Would do it again. 
9238563,81334243,2016-06-22,55063318,Maribeth,Really nice place. Comfortable bed and relaxing environment. Will definitely stay here again. 
9238563,81879673,2016-06-25,39055426,Jim,"Well we got to Robin and Steves home in the PM coming from Az and everything was set up for  us. We came to Orgon for our oldest Gdaughters wedding and did not get back to their home until  late. Not a problem. Robin met us in the morning, how sweet and caring Lady. Steve came to meet us and he is cool guy. The home was set up super, well what we wanted, west Salem close to everything,"
9238563,82169865,2016-06-26,8963043,Salena,"Wonderfully clean and well appointed, the owners provide a super-clean BnB with soft bedding and fresh new towels. The sauna was a delightful treat after a long bike ride. You can hear footsteps upstairs, so light sleepers should take note, but otherwise it is comfortable, spacious and far above the usual BnB. An elegant daylight basement retreat! Robin was a gracious and welcoming host. I recommend!"
9238563,82986750,2016-06-30,74850843,Amanda,"A very nice space! Close enough to the highway to get around, but far enough away to feel homey. Loved the sauna! Instructions were clear, and everything was clean and safe."
9238563,83354317,2016-07-02,35810597,Donna,very quiet and peaceful.
9238563,83940279,2016-07-04,18595542,Andrew,"Steve and Robin were incredibly friendly and welcoming, even providing us with some sparkling water on arrival. It served as an excellent home base for Silver Falls and Eola-Amity and lower Wilamette Valley AVA. Only downside which was minor was the house transits sound easily from upstairs, but this was not a problem during normal sleeping hours. Overall, nice people and a nice place to stay."
9238563,84478949,2016-07-07,37604701,Joshua,Steve and Robin were great hosts for our family of four. Their home was just as described and our family felt right at home in this space. We chose to stay here because it was close to both Portland and Eugene. The neighborhood was nice and seemed very safe. My wife particularly enjoyed the colorful flowers and seating area outside. If we had spent longer we would have used the grill outside too. <br/><br/>I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to my family and friends. 
9238563,85108970,2016-07-10,18928677,Lori,"Steve and Robin were very personal, warm, and welcoming to us. They provided everything they said, and the space was exactly as expected and lovely."

9238563,87396811,2016-07-19,59770850,Nancy,The hostess came out and greeted us. She was very nice. The neighborhood was lovely and convenient for our destination. 
9238563,87699489,2016-07-21,10952700,Meghan,Lovely basement level flat. Very clean and comfortable with a thoughtful bottle of sparkling water in the fridge and a nice kitchen setup. I was in town for work and enjoyed staying at their very comfortable apartment / flat. Kindly provided instructions on parking and entry ahead of time to make the arrival easy.

9238563,90260534,2016-07-31,16153560,Shauna,"Great place to stay! Comfortably sleep 4 people, clean, well appointed and location was excellent to local wineries. We attended a wedding at a neighboring winery, and had no problem getting there and back.  Regretfully didn't have time to try sauna, will definitely stay here again if in the area.   Host had a great selection of teas and coffee for the morning along with breakfast burritos. All around great experience."
9238563,91475696,2016-08-05,76021872,Desiree,"Great, we got in late and it was no problem. We had privacy and the space was very nice. "
9238563,92344766,2016-08-08,16258691,Aron,"Steve and Robin are absolutely great - you can tell they care a lot about their guests comfort. We were very fortunate to be able to meet them during our stay. <br/><br/>The suite maybe the nicest Airbnb accommodation that I've experienced. It's spacious, has a lovely living room space, and the outdoor patio was perfect for a morning coffee. <br/><br/>I highly recommend staying here if you're looking to explore Salem and the surrounding area!<br/><br/>"
9238563,95384846,2016-08-19,80056965,Kerry,They were great hosts and made me feel super welcome and at home in this new town! Such a cozy spot!

The bathroom was very well-appointed and the coffee/breakfast station was perfect. Robin thoughtfully left a little greeting for us, chilled sparkling water and homemade oatmeal cookies!<br/><br/>The location was very convenient to Willamette University and local amenities like grocery and drug stores.<br/><br/>We took the slow route to Portland and visited small wineries on the way, very close to Steve and Robin's place. A nice side trip!"
9238563,98138766,2016-08-29,87387041,Judy,"Robin and Steve were very welcoming! The pictures are great but the actual space is amazing! We had more space than we needed, the property was private and the location was extremely peaceful! We couldn't have asked for a better experience. "

9238563,102626791,2016-09-18,51866989,Renae,"Robin and Steve were such gracious hosts! They were leaps and bounds more than accommodating, so whether you're more of an independent traveler who would appreciate privacy, or a social traveler who welcomes their company---they know how to read their guests. I was in town for work and when I needed my quiet time I had it; and when I needed some friendly conversation they were great enough to chat. All in all, I'd HIGHLY recommend them! <br/>P.s. The sauna such an awesome treat!!"
9238563,102928500,2016-09-19,6312947,Adrienne,Steve and Robin's suite was one of the nicest and most comfortable places I've stayed. Everything was super clean and well taken care of. Their house is in a lovely neighborhood that was very convenient to everything we had planned. Robin sent detailed check-in info to me the morning of our arrival so I didn't have to follow up or reach out to her with questions. Everything listed in their posting is completely accurate. I highly recommend staying here! <br/>

9238563,107479524,2016-10-10,56355350,Barry,Steve and Robin's home is absolutely spotless! I had a wonderful stay from the moment I arrived. They have thought of everything and have gone above and beyond to make their guests comfortable. There is a private entrance to the home for easy access to come and go as you please. The bed is top notch and there is even a sauna in the bathroom. I am an Airbnb host myself and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home.

9238563,130703525,2017-02-07,95957287,Gregory,"Steve and Robin's place was perfect for our daughter's visit to Willamette University. The location was great and the place was spotless. Great communication with the hosts. Even though they were right above us, they were super quiet and not intrusive whatsoever. They provided plenty of linens, towels, blankets, and pillows. We were perfectly taken care of! We didn't get a chance to use the sauna, but it looked amazing. We enjoyed the coffee and oatmeal provided by the hosts. It was a great place to stay. We will definitely be back!"
9238563,131266060,2017-02-11,63651350,Nora,We used the space almost entirely for sleep between conference days and thus didn't take advantage of the sauna or patio. Well-lit stairs down to daylight basement. Met Robin briefly but didn't have time to talk. 
9238563,132070881,2017-02-15,22176227,Stacie,Great for our stay in Salem. Beautiful West Salem downstairs spot that was warm and inviting. We were lucky enough to be able to meet our hosts and were grateful for their dinning suggestions. Will definitely stay again if in the area!
9238563,132398670,2017-02-17,26915404,Ashley,"Steve and Robin were very friendly and accommodating, but when it came down to the sleeping hours the place was a little less than desirable primarily due to the pull out sofa bed. The mattress was so thin or old that you could see (and consequently feel) every spring. There was also no tv as advertised. All other details were fabulous, from the availability of soaps and shampoos to breakfast and coffee. They did have an ant problem though. It wasn't breakfast worth bragging about (frozen Jimmy dean egg sandwiches and packaged oatmeal. .which we mostly avoided) but the sentiment was there. The coffee was nice. The place was not as private as we had expected, so know that if you were to step outside, it is within view of the host and neighbors. That was fine for our situation, but if you're looking for a truly private affair this is likely not it. The host friendliness made it most worth it, but other than that I've stayed in finer establishments for this cost. I give them the high Stars for the friendliness in the communication and the effort (greetings messages, candy bowl, etc.) but the lack of comfort and privacy will not have me returning. "
9238563,132913454,2017-02-19,10332067,Galen,"Everything was so easy and all the details made us feel welcomed and so we'll taken care of. It's a very quiet neighborhood but still within minutes of city center.  We appreciated all the extras like breakfast items, bathroom toiletries, lots of extra pillows and blankets, and space heaters. Robin and Steve were always available for questions and very friendly. "
9238563,133123504,2017-02-20,95938675,Tonja,Steve greeted us upon arrival! Everything we needed to be comfortable for the night was provided.  Thanks so much Steve and Robin. 
9238563,133766880,2017-02-24,109184685,Deona,"Quiet, comfortable, private accommodations exactly as described.  Well-appointed and the sauna is very nice.  Super-clean.  Nice sheets, extra bedding.  Hosts helpful if needed but not intrusive.  Traveled to Salem for an interview and had a very nice trip.  Would definitely stay here again.  "

After checkout, they alerted us right away when they saw we'd left an item in the suite. "
9238563,145565746,2017-04-18,4224984,Brenna,"When I travel to Salem for business, this is where I want to stay.  Steve and Robin are wonderful hosts.  The place is private, with easy check-in and check-out.  The unit is impeccable from the amenities and decor to the small thoughtful details."

9238563,147593762,2017-04-27,47197792,Nick,Steve a Robin's place was perfect for my girlfriend and me. It was located close to some of the hikes we wanted to check out.

9238563,150852114,2017-05-09,45001573,Andrew,"My girlfriend and I stayed for a night in early May 2017 with Steve & Robin. The space was great and was better than advertised. I feel like this is the kind of rental that makes AirBNB a wonderful platform.<br/><br/>Steve & Robin were so easy to communicate with leading up to our stay and we even had the pleasure of saying hi when we met them. Their space was wonderful, tons of open room and amenities. Quiet, incredibly comfortable, plus the hosts were kind enough to leave some breakfast snacks in the minifridge. Made staying there a breeze. Their location was super close to downtown, close to wineries, and close to outdoor parks.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend Steve & Robin to other travelers, and I would stay here again. Fantastic space and experience all around."

9238563,184467683,2017-08-19,131239735,Michael,"As described, a nice, private get away space in an established Salem neighborhood. Great access to grocery, shopping, restaurants--many within walking distance."
9238563,185754441,2017-08-22,4515400,Jay,"Steve and Robin were excellent hosts.  The space is very nice and quiet, and they were so generous to provide us eclipse glasses for the big solar eclipse event."
9238563,189714999,2017-09-02,65635589,Karissa,"We had a great time at Steve and Robin's. Our Job took us to the state fair for 10 days and it was great to have such a quiet private space to enjoy during the craziness of state fair. <br/><br/>Our only mistake was not realizing how many stairs were involved to get in and out of the space. My roommate has trouble with  lots of stairs so in hindsight we should have found a place with minimal stairs. This was not the host's fault at all, they were wonderful, and the space itself was perfect!"
9238563,191240519,2017-09-06,49093623,Stephanie,"Great location, beautiful property and Steve and Robin are oh so sweet! We will definitely be staying again!!"
9238563,194381956,2017-09-16,30716322,Staci,"This space was certainly big enough to expand beyond a hotel room. Lovely spacious bedroom, a living space that has two nice big couches and a small wet bar with microwave and grill so meal prep could be done with a little planning no problem!"

9238563,201713520,2017-10-08,121072775,Judith,"Steve and Robin's Suite is spacious, beautiful and sparkling.  Located below and in back of their beautiful house, it has lots of light and a lovely patio outside, complete with a grill and seating.  There were lots of thoughtful touches included too (coffee, real cream, food treats, a nice steamer for wrinkled clothes) LOTS of space, great TV, great water pressure in shower, fluffy comforter and pillows, etc.   It is conveniently located to WU, shopping and easy access to our favorite hikes, wineries, etc.  Although we'd prefer to keep it a secret (so we can stay there often!) we give this space the highest of high recommendations for a stay in the Salem area.  It was perfect in every way.  And the bonus was meeting their cute little pooch, Anna!"
9238563,203247073,2017-10-14,95737117,Jo-Ann,It was a lovely space and the restaurant suggestions  were  awesome.  The sauna was great.

9238563,210925498,2017-11-11,51861546,Tricia,"I spent one night here while driving through Oregon. I booked this spot just a few hours before arriving. Steve and Robin were shortly in contact, sending me greetings and information about checking in. When I arrived, Robin came out and led me to the apartment, which is every bit as lovely as it appears in the photos.  Despite my last minute booking, my name was written on the welcome chalk board on the counter. There are a lot of special touches that make you feel welcome and cared for. In For a weary traveler such as myself the ultra comfortable bed is a definite plus!"
9238563,211432887,2017-11-12,90884692,Bryant,Steve and Robin have a gorgeous AirBnB unit! We definitely appreciated the use of the sauna after a long day. Location was very nice as well.

The bathroom includes a shower and small (sit/stand) Finnish sauna. Bring your own food; breakfast is a frozen burrito to heat in the microwave. Overall, a peaceful stay close to downtown Salem. Thanks!"
9238563,212632976,2017-11-18,21043976,Ryan,"Very hospitable and despite being just across the bridge from downtown, there is a secluded peace to their quaint neighborhood. Would highly recommend for a weekend stay and visiting the wineries or the Mt Angel Oktoberfest."

9238563,216422655,2017-12-03,18473729,Cory,"You will not regret booking this space. It is ultra clean, stylishly decorated, and very private. Steve and Robin set you up with everything you could need and are just a quick text away if you need anything else. The Sauna is the shining star of this space, so relaxing! Great location, less than 10 dollars to Uber to the down town area of Salem. What are you waiting for...BOOK IT!"

As soon as we walked in we had communication from our hosts on any questions we had and some treats they had left for us. The personal sauna and electric fireplace were the perfect touch and it was a first experience for us both. The entire home was spacious and had everything we could have needed. They were wonderful hosts and I would definitely recommend them to anyone staying in the area!

The space was just massive and extremely clean. There were many lovely extras (the sauna and breakfast burritos in the freezer) that we thought went above and beyond. The home is in a great neighborhood and a very short trip to downtown. We had dinner one night at Rafns', per their recommendation, and it was absolutely delicious. Five stars!"

9238563,256450944,2018-04-22,130786897,Michael,Incredible private space. Hosts are thoughtful and kind. Enjoyed our stay immensely.
9238563,260128053,2018-05-03,121576242,Robert,"Nice place. Just make sure you understand that this place only has one ""real"" bed and one pull-out bed. There's a tiny little couch thing that might work for a child or a Hobbit, but most adults would find it too small. Anyway, I just want to make sure that *you* pay attention to this, because *I* did not, and *I* had to sleep on the Hobbit bed.<br/><br/>Also note that it's essentially the basement of the house that Steve and Robin live in. It's easy to get to, and in a safe, quiet neighborhood. Salem is prettier than I realized.<br/><br/>I'd definitely stay there again."
9238563,260702639,2018-05-04,51086485,Johnny,Amazing spot! Very clean and stylish place. Check in was flexible and I loved steve and robins suite! I would absolutely recommend staying here!

Steve and Robin respected our privacy but were accessible. Great location close to downtown. Gorgeous private patio.<br/>Thanks to Robin and Steve for a wonderful stay.
9238563,264779648,2018-05-14,181682724,Thea,This was a great place to stay! Just on the other sided the river from downtown. All of the little touches that Robin and Steve have done to the space make it that much more enjoyable.

9238563,266914867,2018-05-20,7059327,Ami,"Steve & Robin are very communicative both through AirBnB and through text; we booked four days before the weekend, and they were responsive, and even recommended some wineries for our mini weekend getaway.<br/><br/>Steve & Robin's place is a cozy & cute downstairs level space. The room has a fireplace, which we didn't use. But, we did use the sauna, which was a lovely way to wind down after a day of meandering & wine tasting. <br/><br/>I forgot to communicate that my partner is allergic to down, but they had a clear sign that pointed us to a non-down blanket! There are actually quite a few helpful signs around, and the folder of information is pretty detailed.<br/><br/>One last thing, you can hear the goings on of the floor above (mostly creaks and steps), so if you're a light sleeper or sensitive to sound, that might get to you. But we were fine with sharing a ceiling with the hosts!"
9238563,269720687,2018-05-27,86300508,Milo,Steve and Robins place was wonderful! They were outstanding hosts and made everything very easy. It was super clean and well stocked with snacks. Wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again.

This was the perfect place! It was close enough to everything I needed but I felt like I was in my own world. The sauna was amazing. I used it at least once a day. And the owners had some nice finishing touches.<br/><br/>I would not hesitate to stay here again.

Only drawback is there are steep stairs to the entrance and even though it sleeps up to four you can’t have more than one vehicle if your group is in more than one vehicle. We would stay again if we come back to Salem!"

Beautiful touches and nice aromas invite you in, and little extras, like chocolates and quick breakfast items make you want to stay longer! We really enjoyed our one night at their house and wish it could have been more! They also were able to provide a book of local recommendations on what to do and where to enjoy our time. We loved it!

We stayed in Robin and Steve's Airbnb and it was so warm and cozy.

The electric fireplace, sauna, and game of checkers were our favorite parts!"

9238563,408155483,2019-02-03,7783410,Jordan,"A nice space, with easy access to Salem. The road is very quiet and the sauna was nice.  May want to ask the host what people and animals may be at home to gauge how noisy it may be upstairs (the accommodation is the basement of the house)."

Chocolates, sparkling water, clean spaces, etc. They were also very responsive when the internet was down and helped us get re-connected! The only downside was morning noise- we woke up each morning around 7am because the noise from upstairs carries down to the rental space. Be aware of that when you book- still worth the booking, just a note... Also, their dog is adorable!"
9238563,429079551,2019-03-26,44293276,Melinda,"It was a pleasant experience staying in Steve and Robin's suite.  Their place has easy access and comfortable surroundings.  We were only there for one night, and it suited us nicely.  The queen bed was super comfortable, and the sauna was a fun addition!  We didn't really explore much of the immediate neighborhood, but driving to City Center was quick and easy. Thanks for helping with a lovely trip to Salem!"

9238563,437509768,2019-04-14,105709208,Mara,Steve& Robin’s space was perfect. Clean and stylish and very spacious. The location is perfectly located in a quiet nature area but merely an 8$ Uber Ride to downtown if you don’t feel like driving the one mile or so. The sauna was brilliant and everything was sparkling clean and even better than expected. Check in and parking were easy. There was even coffee and snacks provided. I would highly recommend this spot for a trip to Salem. <br/><br/>Thank you again !

9238563,485930486,2019-07-11,82279381,Gina,"Steve and Robin's home was a wonderful place to base our vacation out of.  They are very accommodating hosts and communication with them was easy and effortless.  The space in their home is comfortable with thoughtful little extra touches like chocolates and breakfast items in the refrigerator.  Little notes are clearly posted informing you of how things work in the home.  My daughters and I didn't spend a great deal of time in the space because we tend to make the very most of any vacation we take, but Steve and Robin's place was very welcoming to come back to after a day of hiking or sightseeing.  I will highly recommend their home to anyone I know who will be traveling to Salem."

Very clean, modern, and enjoyable place to relax. The sauna was amazing! At the time of our stay there was only a microwave and kettle, no cooktop or convection oven so one would need to plan meals around that. The hosts are very kind and thoughtful! We arrived for a valentines weekend, and they had purchased a lovely rose for my wife!"
9238563,616536275,2020-03-09,95440094,Brittany,Lovely place and wonderful hosts. The bed is very comfortable and the sauna was such a nice feature. Would recommend for sure

Nice location, close to University if you are Willamette parents like us! Robin and Steve couldn’t be nicer.  Would highly recommend if travel brings you to Salem."
9238563,761700878,2021-05-23,451199,Hayden,Steve and Robin's place was great! Just what we needed while visiting family. It was very clean and quiet.
9238563,765166359,2021-05-31,415483,Aviva,Wonderful place. Kind hosts!
9238563,394973162758209077,2021-06-28,247869036,Sarah,"Steve and Robin have an excellent set up for guests. They have thought of every detail. The bathroom is located in the bedroom, so if you’re on the sleeper couch, you will have to walk through the bedroom during the night to get to it. This wasn’t an issue for us. Also, if you are on the sleeper couch, it sleeps like a sleeper couch. With that being said, the hosts are so accommodating - they even had breakfast burritos in the freezer for us. They are probably the most accommodating hosts we have ever had. We would gladly return."
9238563,398552727860275115,2021-07-03,349219017,Kenly,"Such a great place to stay! So clean and spacious, it was perfect for our weekend trip."
9238563,402196609364052652,2021-07-08,211176293,Briar,Had a great stay! Thanks to Robin and Steve for having me!!
9238563,404412209901520951,2021-07-11,401497491,Carlos,Sweet place. Clean and spacious! Robin and Steve are extremely welcoming and good communication as well.
9238563,407262528375666924,2021-07-15,56730651,Stephanie,"Robin was a pure delight as she greeted me with warmth and cheer when I arrived. I had originally booked it as a vacation to visit my dad, but he ended up needing surgery and recuperated at the Airbnb with me. It fit the two of us very comfortably. The beautiful patio was a much needed respite and soothing area for us both throughout the day. Robin was very gracious and allowed us to have a few family members visit for a couple hours two nights in a row. <br/><br/>The place has everything you would need and more! It was perfect to have a breakfast sandwich and coffee/tea available, along with breakfast bars and popcorn. It is the little things that mean so much. My dad slept very well on the bed in the bedroom and I was pleasantly surprise how comfortable the pullout couch was for several nights. The bathroom was spacious and worked easily to shared with my dad. Plus it was stocked with anything we needed. <br/><br/>There was an issue as we were coordinating getting my dad to the hospital from the AirBnB  and a gentleman appear concerned about us talking in the driveway - it may have been Steve but he didn’t introduce himself and seem stressed. I know now to be mindful and not to talk in the driveway or the street adjacent to the driveway. Otherwise I did not hear anything from the living space above and felt the space below was very private and secluded. <br/><br/>This AirBnB exceeded all my expectations which were high because of the detailed description and beautiful/accurate photos.  Also, if you are an outdoor person you are within walking distance of a wonderful park, bike and running path, and access to cross the river. The location was just perfect! I was able to was to walk to a high end grocery store each day and grab coffee for myself and my dad. <br/><br/>If I could give this place more than five stars I would!"
9238563,410156866927512984,2021-07-19,217439282,Douglas,Perfect place to stay in West Salem. Excellent location.  Quiet neighborhood. Close to everything you’ll want to see and do in Salem.  It’s truly a gem!

The Sauna is a game changer,  and area itself is so calm and relaxing. It was perfect. Robbin came out to greet us and  gave us a quick tour and wow she was super nice. If we ever come back to Salem we are booking here for sure."

9238563,418916896418070029,2021-07-31,9519077,Deb,"The hosts are warmly welcoming, leaving some chocolate treats and some small breakfast items to go with the coffee and teas. The unit is well appointed, and sauna is a nice touch. Plenty of tourists brochures, and a very thorough welcome manual. They have a very friendly dog so dog lovers will be very happy!  Centrally located, it’s a short drive to everything you need. Good value, I’d highly recommend it for the solo traveler or a couple wanting safe, friendly and easy accommodations!"
9238563,422477276676042181,2021-08-05,407189334,Sharon,"Exceeded all our expectations.  Comfortable, roomy, quiet place.  Having a sauna was also great.  Absolutely beautiful place."

9238563,526906148722191658,2021-12-27,675248,Chris,"Steve and Robin were amazing hosts and left no stone unturned when it came to providing the ultimate hosting experience for their beautiful space. The place itself is much larger and spacious than the pictures do justice. They stocked the location with all the thoughtful items that make it a 5 star+ place such as popcorn for our movie night (they have a Roku box with everything you could want on it), hot chocolate, breakfast items, candy, and drinks as well as coffee and wonderful assortment of tea. There is a lovely faux fireplace heater in the bedroom that provides a very soothing ambiance to fall asleep to. The coup de grace is the sauna they have in the unit that felt amazing to use after being in the cold. The location is very central with both restaurants and breweries within walking distance. I didn't realize it was so close but Downtown Salem is a mere 5 min drive over the bridge. We couldn't have chosen a cozier place to spend a snow white Christmas while in Salem. We hope it is available when we return in the next couple months. Best of all the hosts are as sweet and kind as one could ever ask for and the type of people that make Airbnb such a special community.  We can't wait to return!"
9238563,531283740581988728,2022-01-02,21132444,Molly,"I arranged for my friends (a couple and their 4-month old) to stay at Steve & Robin's, as I lived in the neighborhood, but did not have quite enough space to host them myself.  The place was great!  Very clean, affordable, centrally located, and with a great balance of amenities.  The sauna and breakfast burritos were especially appealing.  There was also OUTSTANDING communication--very prompt replies and easy-to-follow instructions.  I would recommended without any hesitation and my friends already noted their preference to return the next time they are in town.  Thank you both again!"

From the welcoming and assistance of luggage, to the cold beers and quiet/tranquil backyard to enjoy once settled, Leigh & Robert have outdone themselves when it comes to hosting a private getaway in Salem. The Boat House has all the amenities for a short stay, within walking distance to convenient spots for eats/drinks. The accommodations are new, clean, comfortable, and welcoming. We slept the best of our travels during our adventures through Oregon, at this location. We appreciated the contemporary touches throughout, and private/quiet getaway when we wanted it. <br/><br/>Be sure to take Leigh and Robert up on a convo, as the two of them have a fantastic past and are the friendliest of folks Oregon has to offer.<br/><br/>Well wishes, and sweet dreams!<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>B & B<br/>"

We arrived and were in the unit in short order getting unpacked and enjoying the beers they left for us in the fridge. <br/><br/>Like another review says, ""dog-friendly"" is selling this short. More like dog-encouraging. The hosts love dogs and had fun playing with our furry friends. Our two little Boston Terriers LOVED running around the fully fenced yard. Little baggies and a waste bin were even provided. Inside were dog bowls and more. It truly is enthusiastically dog-friendly.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a quiet, comfortable, close to downtown, and run by the friendliest of hosts. It was really perfect for our long weekend in Salem.<br/><br/>Thank you!"

The host communicated promptly and fully, and she even called us to see if we needed anything from the store. The neighborhood was safe and quiet, with the exception of moderate train horn noise in the early mornings.  We had plenty of hot water for showers. Bring fuzzy socks or slippers in the cooler months, as the concrete floors are a bit cold on bare feet."
9477671,112182209,2016-11-04,88686257,Frank,"Leigh was an absolutely wonderful host! The guest house is beautifully decorated, private and cozy.  Leigh was more than helpful with suggestions. She took the time to explain to two first time visitors to Oregon all the great places to check out.  If you are looking to roam the state of Oregon as we did, definitely check out Leigh's guest house in Salem. Leigh truly went way above and beyond to accommodate us and we could not have been happier. Can't recommend Leigh's guest house enough!  "
9477671,112619730,2016-11-06,99918324,Taunya,"We had a great time during our stay.  This place was really lovely, very clean, very stylish.  It was really nice to have Robert there waiting on the porch so we knew we were in the right spot!  The location was great, a very short distance to lots of different restaurants. They left things for our fur baby to use as well, which was very nice.  Bowls, towels, doggie cookies, a blanket.  Super nice and our pup loved it!  We would certainly stay here again.  Our pup was safe and happy and that made us relax and have a great time!"
9477671,113741158,2016-11-13,65256438,Anne,"Leigh and Robert welcomed us with open arms! If you're looking for a cute, clean, and private place to rest your head in an adorable neighborhood, look no further. Local beers in the mini fridge and handmade soap from<br/>Salem were just a few of Leigh's personal touches. We had everything we needed and felt as though we were five minutes from everything in Salem. Thank you, Mrs. Leigh!"
9477671,115706607,2016-11-26,17569226,Jill,"The boat house is by far my favorite Airbnb stay so far.  Leigh was very helpful and accompanying.  The space itself is spacious and so comfortable.  She has literally thought of everything you might need.  We even had a few relatives stay in the cozy camper for a night.  I highly recommend booking the boat house, it was a peaceful quiet oasis during a busy family holiday."

She was great with communication before and during my stay and her house manual was very helpful for any questions I had. The place is extremely clean and very cozy and is much more charming in person that the photos can show. I didn't have any trouble finding parking and was able to get a spot right out front. The yard was great for my pup to do her business - she even provided dog bags for picking up. My stay was short but was able to find food very easily and quickly. I had a wonderful time at Leigh's and would definitely stay there again. I highly recommend it!

9477671,201621662,2017-10-08,113141222,Maria,Adorable house! Super clean with trendy decor. I wish I'd had a longer stay there!
9477671,204167138,2017-10-16,109184685,Deona,"This is a great place to stay.  So great, I hate to put it out there because I want it to be available every time I go to Salem, which is frequently.  Love that it is pet-friendly, even though I did not bring a pet this time, it is a great place for pets.  Quiet, great location, super-comfy bed.  Hosts are quickly responsive, informative and available."
9477671,206302527,2017-10-24,15597310,Sarah,Our first time to Salem and Leigh's charming boathouse did not disappoint! The attention to detail was most impressive...from the local SLAB soaps to the beers waiting in the fridge. We enjoyed the fires outside and all the nature the area has to offer. We LOVED this place and would absolutely stay again!
9477671,209196071,2017-11-04,122519737,Kathryn,Quiet street close to town with a very welcoming space!
9477671,209663370,2017-11-05,36891878,Ryan,"Fantastic space about 1 mile from delightful downtown- walk or Uber. Blown away by the private area and room to relax. Cleanliness was top-notch, cozy and warm, as well as Leigh herself being very inviting and also a great conversationalist. Will definitely stay here again when we head back to Salem."
9477671,213364020,2017-11-20,3559484,Christine,"Leigha’s place was fantastic! They put so much thought and effort into it and into making us feel welcome. The bed and linens were so comfortable. We also appreciated the little touches like the handmade soap, the beer in the fridge, and the doggy treats for our fur baby.<br/><br/>We would definitely stay here again the next time we’re in Salem."
9477671,213712319,2017-11-22,52584459,Josh,"Wonderful spot to stay. We stayed here for a night on our road trip from Seattle to California. They were great with communication, very friendly and our dog loved running around in the backyard."
9477671,214381702,2017-11-25,38298514,Holly,"We loved staying here and will definitely be back if we stay in Salem with Beau again. It can be a challenge to find dog-friendly venues that are also clean and comfortable for the owners. The decor was nice, the bathroom was clean and spacious, the bed was comfortable, with all the amenities we could ask for. Not to mention the added touches for the dog - fenced yard, towels, bowl and canister of COOKIES! Best, Holly, Ryan & Beau"
9477671,214888018,2017-11-26,52584459,Josh,"Great spot if you are traveling with a dog. We stayed here on a road trip and it was great. The place is clean, exactly as described and easy to get to. The host was very communicative and responsive to my emails. Would stay here again!"
9477671,215605790,2017-11-30,104140795,Lizzie,"The boat house was an amazing retreat during a week of appraisal classes. When I arrived, Leigh met me and promptly showed me the space (including two beers and chilled glasses in the mini fridge)! She made sure to introduce her beautiful dog as well, so I would not be alarmed if I found him in the yard. I was busy all week and mostly spent my evenings in the house, but it was a perfect space to recharge. If you want a stylish place close to downtown with really communicative hosts, look no further."
9477671,218046673,2017-12-10,159264777,Brooke,Had a great night here. Everything was perfect!

9477671,225511374,2018-01-06,41487302,Alyson,"Leigh's place is so clean, well equipped, crystal clear instructions on getting in, and cozy. We enjoyed meeting their Dane/G. Shepherd mix as well. Very sweet, docile big dog. Our border collie loved the large yard to roam. If we were to stay in Salem again, we would definitely stay at Leigh's place."
9477671,226621348,2018-01-11,14543703,Vanessa,A wonderful and cute house! I would recommend this for anyone traveling for business as I do. It was a great place to relax and unwind!

9477671,229014468,2018-01-21,71163913,Josh,"The space is a quaint little detached garage-turned guest house.  It is cozy, clean, and comfortable and only about a 5 minute drive to downtown.  The hosts are clearly animal/dog lovers and that makes a huge difference when traveling with your pet."
9477671,231980881,2018-02-03,39374069,Kali,Exceptional.
9477671,236251292,2018-02-18,68259491,Erin,"This place was darling! Great location, close to where I needed to be, and easy place to explore from.

9477671,238435977,2018-02-25,6040038,Tigerlily,"The boat house was really lovely. We were just looking for a place to crash over night and ended up having a really sweet get away feeling because of all of the details Leigh has included. Heated sheets, soft towels, dog treats and even a beverage for the weary traveler. Thank you!"
9477671,241859617,2018-03-10,64093472,Alexandra,What a nice place to stay in the heart of Salem. It was not only a beautiful and comfortable space but Leigh was fantastic.
9477671,242406935,2018-03-11,144365802,Misty,"This was a wonderful oasis! Just as listed and more. Leigh is a welcoming and responsive host, and the space is clean and comfortable. It was so nice to also have a safe space for our dog to stretch her legs after our long drive."
9477671,243109528,2018-03-14,10639664,Jim,"Super clean, great shower and an electric blanket!  Nice and quiet too - the rain on the metal roof helped me sleep like a baby.  Did I mention the electric blanket?"
9477671,243624771,2018-03-16,22007864,Lauren,"Leigh's guest house was amazing! One of the nicest guest houses we've stayed at using Airbnb.  There were many thoughtful touches throughout the guest house, the yard was great for our dog, and Leigh was friendly and accessible.  We'll be back!"
9477671,244533520,2018-03-18,111677587,Kathy,"This is a great place to stay. It was easy to get to restaurants and other activities in town, but was comfortably secluded for privacy. Wonderfully supplied to meet our needs."
9477671,245080880,2018-03-20,14975262,Jason,Great place and a great host!  Will definitely stay again if in the area.
9477671,245541862,2018-03-22,105323611,Sage,"Leigh’s space is amazing. Comfortable, Clean, Stylish.  We felt truly blessed with privacy well attended!  When staying in Salem this is the place to be!!  Thank You Leigh!<br/>Sage & Polly"
9477671,245782577,2018-03-23,12911502,Rachel,"Leigh was so accommodating. I had to book this place last minute due to a family emergency. After one night my plans changed and i had to alter my dates, and Leigh was so understanding and helpful. Most importantly, the space is just gorgeous! Everything from the ginger ale in the fridge to the heated beds were carefully thought out by Leigh to make the space warm (literally) and inviting. I have been raving about the space to my family in the area!"
9477671,246097071,2018-03-24,27762248,Garrett,Immaculately clean with a lovely private space.
9477671,246984787,2018-03-26,25698217,Chris,"Leigh's place was absolutely perfect for my wife and I. It's a small and cozy studio, but still has plenty of room to move around. You can tell Leigh put a lot of thought into making the space comfortable and stylish. The shower pressure was excellent and the bed was extremely comfortable!<br/><br/>Downtown Salem doesn't have much to offer, though it is growing, so we used the location as a center point for our day trips to the coast (Pacific City) and to a waterfall hike to the east (Abiqua Falls). I would definitely book this space again."
9477671,247524335,2018-03-28,33610106,Ernesto,This is place is perfect for the couple who are traveling and need a great place to sleep. My wife and I drove from Southern CA to Vancouver BC and were on the road all day. We booked Leigh's place a few hours before getting there. She responded quickly and the place was ready for us when we arrived late in the evening. The place was cozy and the heater turned on so the place was warm when we arrived. The highlight was the heated bed!  It was the best night sleep of our 6 day road trip! We definitely would stay there again.
9477671,247810297,2018-03-29,116434752,Miki,"Much more than we expected! <br/>Ultra clean, nice and thoughtful touches everywhere we looked and great place!"
9477671,251342548,2018-04-07,131364442,Gail,"Leigh and Robert are wonderful hosts. The place was perfect for our needs...a super comfy bed, quiet, and all the WiFi we could use. Parking was a breeze. If you are headed to the Oregon State Fair and Expo grounds it’s perfect! Walking distance!<br/><br/>Be sure to check out the drawers of the table. There are all sorts of helpful info about Salem. <br/><br/>We will definitely be back!"
9477671,251897271,2018-04-08,36234374,Mary,"Very comfortable, private space. I liked the special touches.<br/>Although our visit was very short we still got to meet Leigh and her sweet dog.<br/>She was the perfect host!"
9477671,252707530,2018-04-11,6165892,Eileen,We had a great one night stay here with our dog. The yard was great and perfect for our dog to run around after our long drive stuck in the car all day! <br/><br/>The place was nicely decorated and clean and the bed was very comfortable.  Leigh was very friendly and helpful if we needed anything. <br/><br/>Thanks again for having us!
9477671,252937809,2018-04-12,14081480,Danielle,"The space was fabulous... heated bed with super soft sheets, waterfall shower, and great lighting. Leigh was really friendly!"

9477671,255178931,2018-04-19,61965928,Jay,"Leigh and Robert were fantastic hosts! They were both so easy to visit with and fun to talk to. Ryder (the dog) was a huge sweetheart and so very friendly. Their place is wonderful and cozy, private and comfortable. They had numerous suggestions for us for wineries, restaurants and activities, all of them were spot on. We are definitely staying again next time we are anywhere near Salem."
9477671,256393054,2018-04-22,38927528,Marcus,"This is such an amazing place to stay! Leigh is a fantastic host and the space is super cute and stylish. We could not recommend this place more. Thanks for letting us spend a couple of days here, Leigh!"

9477671,264804037,2018-05-14,18977340,Terrence,"This is a great AirBnb! Exactly the reason we choose these types of properties over a hotel room. Very clean, cute space with everything we needed for a great weekend in Salem. Great host.  Highly recommend this spot!"
9477671,265949292,2018-05-18,93208954,Miranda,"I loved this place. Clean, nice, and super comfy. I loved the hosts. Also, bonus points for their super sweet dog. All the attention to detail and thoughtful amenities made it the perfect place to relax after a long day. The bed and the sheets were outstanding! Definitely the best AirBnb I have stayed in."
9477671,267798700,2018-05-22,66449356,Sue,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this charming boathouse.  The space included so many fun and helpful details; it was obvious the hosts went out of their way to make guests comfortable.  The bed was super comfortable and the decor very stylish and interesting.  We also enjoyed sitting outside in their lovely back yard. Hosts were friendly, fun and very helpful.  I highly recommend."
9477671,268691485,2018-05-25,143414644,Elizabeth,"Wonderful guesthouse, super clean, easy to find, simple check-in experience, and just as pictured! We will definitely consider staying here again anytime we’re in the area. "

9477671,270307516,2018-05-28,4440100,Rebecca,Leigh's home was lovely!  The house was much bigger then it looks in pictures and very comfortable. Leigh and her husband were very kind and helpful. 
9477671,271592118,2018-06-01,34006181,Ashley,"This place is so cute and cozy! Central location is nice - we were in town for my brothers graduation just south in Lebanon, OR but wanted to explore Portland as well.<br/><br/>Leigh communicates so quickly! This was a huge blessing as we changed our dates last minute to stay our final night right by the Portland airport to catch an early flight. <br/><br/>The bed is SO comfy! We had a very peaceful nights rest. The decor is very farmhouse (which we LOVE). <br/><br/>We would definitely come back to stay again! <br/><br/>Thanks!"
9477671,273044191,2018-06-04,21822866,Julie Anne,This was a wonderful place to have as a home base for our Silver Falls trip. Leigh and her husband are super friendly and went out of their way to help (even lent my friend a pair of shoes!). The space was immaculate and well-designed. Their pupper is the cutest and the backyard is charming. We had everything we needed. I would stay here again if ever back in Salem!
9477671,273344504,2018-06-05,7001575,Lauren,"A wonderful place to stay! The bed was AMAZING first off. It’s the little details that matter to us as we travel often and stay in hotels weekly. Just a few details we loved: the locally made hand soap that smelled of lavender, the fire pit and wood provided, the small dog bed for any pet you may bring, and the coffee and teas provided were all such lovely touches. We will definitely be back:)"
9477671,274268823,2018-06-08,92847672,Kevin,Great place.<br/>Excellent host.
9477671,274643581,2018-06-09,134264402,Adam,This is a lovely little place in a quiet neighborhood.  It was raining much of the time we were there (just one night) but if the weather was better you could walk downtown (about a mile) to various bars and restaurants. Leigh is a great host and loves your dogs!  We met her Great Dane and he was super cute as well!
9477671,275807512,2018-06-11,29951775,Myron,"What a great place to stay. Leigh was in constant communication and gave us some great tips to make our hike to Abiqua Falls as seamless as possible. She was so nice to us and wanted to make sure we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Her place was perfect to come home to after a long exhausting day of hiking, set just right for some relaxing. Thanks for the hospitality Leigh! "
9477671,276405633,2018-06-13,119135383,Nicholas,"Perfectly positioned in Salem.  The neighborhood is quaint and quiet.  Leigh and her husband are great hosts, welcoming and helpful, but respect your privacy.  The Urban Boathouse is adorable, immaculate, spacious, and well appointed."
9477671,277140261,2018-06-15,2163799,Sean,"Leigh's place is amazing. It is spacious, comfortable, super clean and quiet. It is also withing walking distance to great restaurants. I can't wait to stay here again."
9477671,277561045,2018-06-16,131457612,Andrew,Leigh's place is in a great part of Salem. It's really close to a cool part of town with good restaurants and bars but it's far enough away that it is really quiet at night. It was clean and very comfortable. 
9477671,278337403,2018-06-17,45572871,Sarah,Beautiful space and great hosts!
9477671,283391450,2018-06-29,119135383,Nicholas,"Leigh and her husband are fantastic hosts!  This is my second stay at their Urban Boathouse and I am already looking to book my third.  This time I had my dog with me and it worked out beautifully.  Usually, my pup is a bit anxious at a new spot, but by the second day, she was relaxed and secure in her surroundings.  I could not ask for my gracious and responsive hosts!  See you both soon."
9477671,300702513,2018-08-02,74263808,Cris,Absolutely worth every single penny! Hands down better than any hotel in the area. 
9477671,301770979,2018-08-04,85880341,Samantha,The space was cute and private. Leigh gave us great suggestions for dinner and adventure. Check in was easy and we would definitely stay here again.

9477671,305051631,2018-08-10,49768305,Roy,"Super clean, comfortable space fused with spectacular hosting-craft.  IMMACULATELY CLEAN, they must somehow autoclave the entire unit between guests.  Soft sheets, chilled glasses, fancy soap...so many neat, unexpected, welcome touches after a long bike ride up The Willamette.<br/><br/>And it’s not just the comforting physical space:  Ryder, Leigh, and Robert’s natural quirky welcoming vibe made us feel like we were not visitors.  For three days, We Were Home.  <br/><br/>Recommend you throw the fuzzy pineapple to Ryder a few times, stroll the friendly neighborhood, and try a cool local wine or coffee on the patio next to the vintage travel-trailer.  Robert, Leigh, and Ryder have many insightful ideas how to enjoy Salem and The Willamette."
9477671,306600664,2018-08-12,29600342,Andy,"Very well appointed house, even nicer than as presented on the site which is rare. Checking in and out was a breeze. Highly appreciate houses that are dog friendly but so clean you aren’t sure if a dog’s ever stayed there before. "

9477671,312558910,2018-08-23,210367774,Cristin,"I would go back in a minute. Leigh communicated quickly, was so very kind and respectful, and the space she and Robert have created is stylish, peaceful and homie.  It is  located close to downtown, Willamette, waterfront park and the capital."

The guest house was very clean and the bed was so soft and comfortable! There is not a kitchen, but a coffee maker is provided, which was all we needed since we were only visiting for a day. Thoughtful touches include local craft beer in the fridge and a perfectly placed full length mirror. This house is close to downtown, too! There are train tracks nearby and we heard one train at night, so be aware if you're a light sleeper. This was a lovely space for our short and sweet visit to Salem. I would definitely stay here again if I'm back in Salem!"

9477671,342444187,2018-10-28,15355700,Karrie,"Clean, cozy, and everything you need. Great linens for a nice sleep. For TV viewers and cooks, this isn't your space. But relishing in conversations and music, by the fire pit, or inside enjoying the coffee and provided beers/Hansen's, you can't beat it. Love it. WE'll be back next time in Salem."
9477671,346727098,2018-11-09,130044067,Luba,"Leigh and Robert were great hosts. Very warm and welcoming. The fenced in backyard was perfect for our puppy. Leigh's dog Ryder was very well bahaved and played well with our pup. Anything we needed Leigh was more than happy to help with. The fire pit was a great touch and let us enjoy ourselves in the evenings. Definitely recommend if you have a pup of your own and want a laid back stay!<br/><br/>Thank you guys!<br/>-Dan, Luba and Sharik"

There were even dog treats and bowls for my pup. The location was great- easy to get downtown and the actual street was tree-lined and cozy.

No problems upon arrival and  was pleasantly surprise by all the simple details. Very cool space I felt like I was in a fancy little hotel room. Minimalist yet every touch thought out. No TV not and wasn’t an issue when you’re feeling romantic and have amazing food recommendations of going to Christo’s. Truly a great staycation for anyone. Not a place to take long showers 🚿 but everything was very nice."

9477671,410757427,2019-02-10,4131637,Timothy,"Excellent location, great cottage, exceptionally cool hosts - overall an A+ Airbnb experience. Leigh was attentive and easy to talk to. We were traveling through Salem gathering intel on the city (we hope to relocate to Oregon in the future) and the surrounding areas. Leigh popped over and provided some useful insider info, as well as good company in general. Definitely the place to stay."
9477671,412110931,2019-02-14,141424048,James,Leigh’s place is great! She provided an excellent local tip for cuisine as well :) Wonderful place to stay.
9477671,412510311,2019-02-15,97713683,Leann,Our stay was great! It was even more stylish in person and there were lots of thoughtful small touches. It was great to stay in a place with our pup and to have our own space separate space. I LOVED the shower head (want to get one for myself!) and loved having a heated blanket on the bed for use. My only tip to future visitors is to wear your socks in the winter- the floors get chilly! 😃
9477671,412915483,2019-02-16,173287726,Matt,This cozy guest house will be a home away from home. The boat house has such cozy features and is quite stylish. My girlfriend and I were so impressed with the living space and the hospitality of the host. The location too is perfect for getting around Salem. Highly recommend staying here when in Salem.
9477671,414174652,2019-02-18,3859828,Alexa,"Wonderful location! This is a beautiful space that's centrally located. The home has so many intentional details. She and her husband even included cold beverages like La Criox in the fridge - it warms my hipster millennial heart. We really found the space to be comfortable, convenient and easy to access. The check-in and overall communication was top notch. I would highly recommend Leigh's boathouse to anyone looking for a comfortable space in the Salem area."

9477671,417933732,2019-02-28,156377177,Michelle,"Staying at the boat house was great! My boyfriend and I are planning to move to Salem and needed a reasonably priced place to stay for 2 nights to look for apartments. The location was right in the middle of everywhere we needed to go. The place was charming with a separate enterance. Leigh was very quick with all responses. She greeted as we arrived a few minutes early with Ryder (he is adorable) to make sure we got settled. She was very personable and made sure to give us pointers on food and areas to check out. It was very cold out and she even turned on the heater for us. The place was clean, the bed comfy, and had everything we needed. As others mentioned, your showers need to be quick due to hot water running out, but Leigh mentions that in the instructions and it didn't bother us much. Overall it was a great way to be greeted in Salem and we would definitely recommend!"
9477671,419401211,2019-03-03,21024127,Randi,"Unbelievable bed as many reviewers mentioned! Loved the rain shower and bathroom.

9477671,439331683,2019-04-18,42994179,Kevin,"This was the first road-trip with my pup. We used a few Airbnb’s along the way, and this was *by far* the best. Some places “accept” dogs (with fees), but this place is dog centric, and one of the few places my dog actually felt comfortable in. The boat house is awesome. Great amenities. Great hosts. Can’t say enough."

Me and my family had a great stay and with it being close to the riverfront for a concert we were attending and in a nice, quiet neighborhood it made for a comfortable and convenient stay. The home was really nice and very clean and they have done a great job with it as a whole. Having a fully fenced yard for our dog was awesome and I felt very comfortable walking him around the neighborhood as well. Although not advertised as suitable for kids it was just fine for us who have a baby who's not very mobile yet. There was plenty of room for a pack and play. We'd definitely stay again if we end up coming back to Salem and are in need of a place to stay."

Private entry and space, cute touches (the fire-simulated heater is super neat), cozy, no TV (which is a plus, in my book!), had everything we could have needed or forgot at home, and a convenient location for our travel purposes.  Only downside is that the hot water only lasts 10 minutes or so before needing to reset, so showers were slightly hurried, but that wasn't enough to make this anything less than a 10/10."

9477671,635755253,2020-07-07,55946423,Liane,Probably one of the best AirBnbs I have ever stayed at. The place was cute and quirky with stylish design features on the inside. Leigh and Robert have done an amazing job of creating a space that emulates the best parts of Oregon and just makes you want to hang out inside –– or outside on the lawn–– all day. They were incredibly friendly and giving and had great advice for activities and food. The neighborhood is also very cool and the neighbors are very friendly. Only a 20-minute walk from downtown. Leigh recommended we check out the farmer's market and we were so glad that we did. 100% recommend this wonderful AirBnb experience.
9477671,636543063,2020-07-10,694085,Davis,Leigh's place was a great place to stay for the night on our Pacific Northwest road trip.  It's a very nice and thoughtfully decorated cottage situated in the backyard of their home.  Leigh was very helpful in getting us checked in and providing some tips for Salem and the neighborhood.  We also enjoyed sitting out in the backyard with some complementary drinks she provided.
9477671,638232737,2020-07-14,17368578,Virginia,"Nice clean quiet space in pretty neighborhood, close to everything & nice to just walk around the area & look at houses. Comfy bed, very clean. Nice fenced yard for my dogs to just be let out for their morning constitutional without concern. -- I feel I should mention the train, though, in case that's not just temporary. (I'm hoping Leigh will comment on this, if I'm wrong.) The place is near enough the train tracks that the (prolonged) 3am whistle/horn as it comes through town can be clearly heard & woke me both nights. Just FYI, if you're a light sleeper.  Otherwise, great."
9477671,638793692,2020-07-16,229521588,Aja,"Super comfortable little place. Lovely neighborhood, quiet space. Easy to find and easy check in. The space was clean and the amenities made it feel homey.

Bed was big and cozy, rain shower was awesome, back yard was perfect for us and our dog, and as a bonus her majestic great dane Rider got along fine with our 14 year old grumpy border collie :D<br/>Leigh left us to our own when we wanted privacy, but make herself available for advice on local restaurants, wineries and parks. Place is perfectly situated for bike rides and walks to local coffee shops and restaurants, and is a short drive from beautiful Oregon Wine Country.<br/>Leigh takes COVID preparation very seriously, and all precautions were taken -- we felt very safe and taken care of staying at her place for the weekend.<br/>You'd be hard pressed to find a nicer place in the Salem area. If you're road-tripping north or south through Oregon and want to take a peaceful break, this is where you want to be!"

The studio they rent is located in their backyard and is really secure. I honestly cannot believe they transformed this adorable and stylish studio out of an old barn! I strongly recommend looking in the left desk drawer to check out the book Leigh made showing the renovation process. Leigh and Robert think of all the smallest things, nice towels, specific instructions on how to use the space to its best value, a heated mattress (I didn't even know they made those!), etc. I only stayed for one night, but felt welcomed and comfortable. Most importantly, during this time of COVID-19, I felt CLEAN & SAFE!!"

9477671,406583547203649751,2021-07-14,239441769,Charlie,I highly recommend this place! Perfect for a business trip or a couple. I give this a 5 out of 5 stars without hesitation.
9477671,409439744022105020,2021-07-18,236065252,Julia,Nice hosts!  Accurately described.  Place was very cute and comfy.  I’d definitely stay again.  Neighborhood is peaceful and nice fenced in yard.  Was great for my dog.  Their fur baby is a sweet heart.  <br/><br/>A side note....I left my dogs food dish out and apparently it was a nice incentive for ants.  But Robert helped me resolve the issue immediately and tossed the food and issue was resolved.  It might be just a summer thing but keep your dogs food sealed if your traveling with a pet.  <br/><br/>Nice people and place!
9477671,413107144031323967,2021-07-23,40551065,John,Leigh's place was awesome! Cute decor. The complimentary beers were much appreciated. Leigh was super helpful in giving us tips for our road trip. Highly recommended!
9477671,414488080195342065,2021-07-25,48077461,Lisa,Charming studio. Was extremely clean and photos are very accurate. Owner went out of her way to make us feel welcome. Left beers in the fridge along with sparkling water. Would definitely stay here again.
9477671,418075132575999426,2021-07-30,1606698,Caitlin,My husband and I stayed one night while cycling the Willamette Valley Scenic Bikeway. We LOVED Leigh’s place. It was pristine clean and comfortable with SUCH attention to detail. The mattress was so comfortable and the area is so quiet. Would absolutely stay again.
9477671,418910466372880005,2021-07-31,181070885,Hannah,Perfect size for two people. It’s very central to the area and the host is very kind. She also gave us good recommendations on places to go.

Their recommendations for what to do in the area were exactly what we were looking for. We felt very safe and comfortable in their guest house. Too bad the time went so quickly. Hopefully we can return someday soon."
9477671,433324322225154546,2021-08-20,194168052,Gary,"We love this place. We had everything we needed, including specialty items like hand crafted soaps, an extremely comfortable “purple” mattress, the rain shower is fantastic, and the WiFi signal is incredibly fast … the overhead fan and air conditioner was more than enough to handle the severe heat wave we faced in August.<br/><br/>The restoration of this space was first class. We hope to return here every time we visit the Salem area."
9477671,434826423226551376,2021-08-22,16232030,Noah,"Leigh’s place was perfect for our weekend getaway! Very close to downtown, in a quaint neighborhood.

9477671,439098299152523355,2021-08-28,191970815,Eric,Beautiful spot for our anniversary trip to see a concert at the state fair. The fair was walking distance and there is good food and coffee close as well.<br/>Leigh and Robert were great. This was by far the best greeting we've gotten in any Airbnb stay. (And they provided good coffee equipment on request!)<br/>You won't be disappointed choosing this stay.
9477671,443530248552552333,2021-09-03,378642012,William,"Super clean little place in NE Salem. Very nice host, cute dog, and a nice backyard to chill out after hiking or visiting."

This was a perfect little spot to do a little work in the bungalow and explore the city of Salem. Leigh was very comminicative and made sure we had everything we needed during our stay. Would definitely stay here again."

9477671,460193853659666675,2021-09-26,24238728,Lee,"Leigh’s place was just what we were looking for. We stayed one night here on a road trip, and it had everything we needed. The bed was AWESOME, as well as the pillows. My husband normally sleeps pretty poorly away from home, and he was lights out all night. <br/><br/>He’s also 6’ 6”, so we appreciated the very tall and high quality shower head. Finishings throughout were great, and the neighborhood was quiet. Our doggo was also very comfortable, loved the enclosed yard for easy potty breaks. Would stay again."
9477671,463762751815989448,2021-10-01,249539519,Cass,"This is a wonderfully run, clean, and cozy place to stay. The location was perfect as were the hosts!"

The location was amazing, there was lots of good food nearby, the yard was spacious and best of all super dog friendly! Our fur babies felt comfortable and slept through the night as if we were home! The guest house is super modern and cozy. Very dog friendly which was nice. My husband and I could not stop talking about how pretty the whole space was! After a long day of travel this place was perfect to just relax!"

9477671,474725690538124274,2021-10-16,5355141,Adam,It's perfect for a couple or solo traveler. Very comfortable and cute but minimalistic and affordable too. Short drive to Silver Falls trails. (10 waterfalls in 3 hours. Yes please.)
9477671,475371793424511756,2021-10-17,14472144,Marcie,"This place is both comfortable and inviting, a perfect combination of rustic (with history!) and modern convenience. I loved the aesthetic, the spacious feel, and the welcoming hosts, both human and canine."

9477671,496443965262745293,2021-11-15,98953538,Tori,"Our stay at Leigh’s was wonderful! The space was very clean and had thoughtful touches that added to our stay there. They are very dog friendly, and our dog had a blast running around with their dog Rider in the fenced in yard. It was a cozy and comfortable space for us to call home for the week."
9477671,497146977423916419,2021-11-16,426892880,Brianna,There isn’t a thing she hasn’t thought about to help make your stay as comfortable as possible ! Would definitely stay again :))

9477671,500730008075179575,2021-11-21,44759071,Rosslyn,"This place was perfect! Easy to find, on a beautiful street in what I gathered to be a very nice neighborhood. Checking in was easy peasy, and Leigh was very accommodating to my not knowing exactly when I might show up. My pup enjoyed the big yard to stretch his legs and take care of business. The guest house itself is absolutely adorable, thoughtfully decorated to feel comfortable and homey. It's fairly large, and stocked with everything I could have possibly wanted. Would absolutely stay here again!"
9477671,501567791548904360,2021-11-22,432675512,Lauren,Absolutely wonderful! Leigh is very kind and hospitable.

9477671,505197097941761835,2021-11-27,153978411,Theresa,Perfect little hideaway. Hosts thought of everything!!
9477671,509547511692586550,2021-12-03,86905238,Ken,The three of us (one of us is a dachshund) enjoyed our stay.  The cottage is definitely dog friendly with dog treats and a bowl for dog food or water.  The TV had all of the channels and a few of the premium services.  Leigh recommended Christo's for dinner.  A great suggestion.
9477671,510902597008220765,2021-12-05,62967693,Naomi,"The guest house was a fantastic stay. It was easy to access, spacious, and clean, and my dogs loved the yard. We had everything we needed and there were some nice touches like extra dog treats."
9477671,513097329393593593,2021-12-08,551207,Kathleen,"This is a great place, especially for people with dogs because of the yard. The house is impeccably clean and all of the furnishings are very nice, including a very comfortable bed. I particularly enjoyed the ductless heater, which gave me complete control over the temperature inside. Leigh is a wonderful host, providing great directions both before arrival and onsite in written material. She checked in to make sure I had everything I needed, yet she was not intrusive. The only drawback for me was that I didn't want to eat meals out and the kitchen area is very limited. But for most travelers, I think this is a wonderful Salem option at a great price."
9477671,516696071099783677,2021-12-13,428546163,L,"I found the urban ‘boathouse’ to be one of comfort, warmth, and relaxation. I feel Leigh and Robert designed the boathouse with the traveler in mind. There is room to move around, light comes in through the many windows, and it feels like a home. The bed was so comfortable, the bathroom spacious, and the large bath towels were soft and absorbent! Leigh and Robert are caring hosts who made me feel at home. And their dog Ryder is the coolest!! I highly recommend the urban ‘boathouse’. When you stay, make sure you check out the desk drawers. There is an interesting book of the history of Leigh and Robert’s house and how the boathouse came to be."
9477671,520331159153287854,2021-12-18,26184965,Kiana,"Perfect spot! Comfortable, very clean, and such welcoming hosts. Highly recommend!"
9477671,535530141245289165,2022-01-08,116556527,Geremy,"Leigh was extremely responsive, the guest house was super tidy and very homey. Close to taphouses, foody spots, and grocery stores. All in all it was a great experience, and my partner and I would highly recommend Leigh's guest house if you're looking for a place to stay while you're in Salem 😁"

9477671,546495371436106642,2022-01-23,20785163,Valerie,This is a very cute and comfortable place to stay. Host was available and communicative. <br/><br/>Parking and checking in were simple. <br/><br/>Plenty of clean blankets and plush towels. Everything was easy to find. <br/><br/>We really enjoyed the “fireplace” space heater while we watched movies. Bring slippers if you’re visiting in the colder months as the floor was on the cold side but overall great experience. <br/><br/>Would definitely stay here again.
9477671,547192503987710497,2022-01-24,48328313,Elizabeth,Quiet clean and well appointed.  So many thoughtful details <br/>Husband loved the heated bed. My side stayed cold. My preference <br/>Lovely neighborhood to walk the dog<br/>Secure back yard<br/>We dined at Basil and Board. Pizzas were excellent.  Menu is very tempting. We hope to return

All the detail made this place feel special. We would definitely stay here again. If you like a clean comfortable and stylish place, this is the place for you."
9477671,562374691878755126,2022-02-14,342346727,Ava,"This was a perfect place to stay in Salem! The place was comfortable, beautifully decorated, and well stocked! We enjoyed our stay, and would definitely stay here again. Leigh keeps the place stocked with plenty of extra towels, shampoo, conditioner, bar soap, feminine sanitary products, extra tooth paste, shaving cream, etc which was very much appreciated. I will say that the hot water in the shower doesn’t last very long, so keep showers short (Leigh mentions this in a note within the unit, so fair warning). Overall, we had a great experience here. Also for In-N-Out burger fans, the In-N-Out is only 10-12 minutes from Leigh’s place! We ate there way too much during our stay in Salem lol."
9477671,563856940321898777,2022-02-16,444830506,Virginia,"A great place for my first Airbnb experience.  Leigh was very helpful in sharing her experience as a host, and the place was both clean and comfortable."

9477671,586261094501044616,2022-03-19,418337416,Todd,We enjoyed our stay here. We were not here for long. We arrived late in the evening and left the next morning. The place is reasonably priced and is very comfortable. The place is in the backyard so it doesnt feel completely private though once inside you cant even tell. I am sure there are amenities we did not utilize due to our short stay. We would stay again!
9477671,592864076412422227,2022-03-28,58616518,Lynnie,Leigh was a phenomenal host. She responded quickly to our communications and offered suggestions about what to see and do in the area. She even accommodated a last minute request for an additional person to join us on our stay. The Airbnb itself was very clean and inviting. It had all the comforts you'd need for a pleasant stay. I'd recommend staying here again.

9477671,634792044886381738,2022-05-25,14344923,Clare,"One of my top 5 favorite airbnbs. The mattress was super comfy, host communication was exceptional, and backyard was perfect for our dogs. The hosts seemed to actually like dogs (left out dog treats and wrote house rules that show they understand and care for dogs). It was a huge stress relief to know that Leigh and Robert were welcoming to our pups. I will definitely recommend this spot to friends passing through Salem."

9477671,676901762269108991,2022-07-22,261379896,Melia,"We cannot say enough nice things! The studio is adorable and modern with lots of little touches to make you feel welcome (our pups got treatos!). Our gracious hosts came out to greet us and we let our dogs meet, but in the end our 2 pups got the whole yard to themselves for shenanigans and we are SO thankful! Check in was easy, all directions were clear inside the studio for ease of use, and they even have a lending library out front! HIGHLY recommend for a weekend getaway or an oasis on a drive up the 5."

We would certainly stay again for longer next time we come through!"

Don't miss Bigwig bakery nearby). <br/><br/>We'll definitely stay here again next time we swing by Salem."

Highly recommended the stay and hope to be able to book it the next time I’m in town.

Leigh was the ultimate host, offering privacy, but also her generous spirit and she checked to see if I needed anything. Inside and out, her guesthouse is perfect. Clean, comfortable, modern, stylish and quite spacious with a high airy ceiling and handsome dark wood cross beams and furniture. The bed is also divine. So comfortable and cozy. The kitchen area, dressing area, and bathroom were all so well thought out and designed. I also loved the dark concrete floors made cozy with lots of rugs. The guesthouse also has a great heat pump, perfect for cooling or heating the room. Outside there is a firepit and cool chairs and nice garden area. Don't hesitate with this place. Stay here!"

She is such a fantastic host, and has many extra thoughtful touches including for pets coming along for the stay. Additionally I really appreciated some of the eco friendly features—just because you’re traveling doesn’t mean you have to compromise on sustainable practices. Thanks Leigh, looking forward to staying again at your place in the future 💚"

9477671,833422994605062369,2023-02-23,14610757,Aubrey,"The place was VERY clean and just as described, very cute roomy ADU! Easy check-in, responsive host. Bathroom was very clean, comfy bed. Nice little touches with keurig/fridge/microwave/dining table. It was even toasty warm in there in the 30 degree winter weather!<br/><br/>The only thing potentially negative I have to comment on is the lack of blinds on the frosted glass front door (the door is mostly glass) and the 4 probably 0.5x3 foot windows. Unfortunately the room was pretty light without these and especially light early as the sun came up.<br/><br/>Thanks for sharing your cute place!"

9477671,839991568832408314,2023-03-04,123363763,Meghan,"This was perfect for my conference stay. Check in was technically at 3 but the host was willing to let me check in earlier so I wouldn’t have to come into an unfamiliar neighborhood after dark. <br/>It didn’t matter. Their host house AND the guest house were well lit. The instructions for check in and access were exactly as described. I felt safe and so comfortable. I wish I could have stayed an extra night just to sleep. There were train tracks nearby but if a train went by in the night, I didn’t hear it at all. <br/>Thank you so much for such a cozy spot. If I ever have to do this trip again, I know where to look first for a place to stay!"

9597053,60223505,2016-01-20,53374511,Cambria,Karen was an absolutely wonderful host! She immediately made us feel welcome and her overall hospitality was so genuine. The accommodations were above and beyond what we expected. We couldn't have been happier with our choice to stay with Karen!
9597053,60849450,2016-01-28,8446168,Kristin,Karen was amazing as always!  She even mailed back my ipad charger.  I am so grateful for all she does when I come stay.
9597053,61487865,2016-02-05,6063586,Barbara,"Karen was very easy to communicate with, and everything was ready for us even though Karen was preparing to go out of the country.  The apartment was cozy and homey, and the kitchen was great to cook in, with nice knives, pans, etc.  The only drawback -- and Karen said she'd fix this -- was the lack of a decent reading lamp in either the living room or bedroom.  Otherwise all was as the listing described, we would stay here again."
9597053,70064430,2016-04-15,25683636,Aaron,Karen is the most attentive and caring host. She went above and beyond helping myself and my girlfriend out our last week  b/c of our jobs and can't give enough thanks. She is very informative of the area and if you are looking for something to do she can help. The home is very cute and clean and has everything and more you can ask for. Very quiet neighborhood that is close to everything and on a sunny day a very nice walk to down town. We have booked more time with Karen in her historic home and look forward to it. Highly recommend! 
9597053,70334526,2016-04-17,10526217,Selena,"We loved our stay at Karen's place. Though Karen was out of town and we didn't have the chance to meet, she was easily available by text message and let us know everything we needed to have a comfortable stay.  Knowing that we were bringing our sons (two years old and newborn), Karen thoughtfully left a high chair and toddler dishes in the kitchen for our use.  The location was perfect for us.  It's within a mile of Riverfront Park and stops and restaurants downtown.  We spent a lot of time at Riverfront Park, walking on the paths, playing on the playground, and riding the carousel.  We were very comfortable during our stay -- I think we all actually slept better than we do at home!  We'll definitely return if we're in Salem again."
9597053,71160158,2016-04-24,15620609,Carolyn,Karen was a great host. She met us and helped us settle in. She lives in an apt upstairs and the kitchen in our apt was fully stocked. Turns out this was great for me since I needed to make a soup for Passover for my step- daughter at Willamette U. We had a great time!
9597053,73706310,2016-05-09,25683636,Aaron,"We love staying with Karen and hated to leave. She went above and beyond as a host to make sure we were comfortable and to help with all of our things. She has the kindest spirit and warmest heart. We hope, by chance, that we get to stay with her again before our travels take us else where. "
9597053,73805455,2016-05-10,43983635,Mariesa,"Karen was welcoming, and very professional. She greeted us when we arrived and she also got in contact with me before we arrived so that everything went smooth. She also helped us find a great hiking spot where we had one of the best hikes of our trip. The house was spacious, clean, and honestly felt like a real home, not just somewhere we were staying. It was close to stores and to downtown Salem so the location was perfect. "
9597053,74700236,2016-05-16,42923982,Miya,"Karen's home was just the perfect spot for my husband, daughter and myself to stay while attending our son's graduation from Willamette.  The location was convenient, near downtown and the college but in its own quiet neighborhood.  The house was well appointed with everything we might need.  Karen was a welcoming host, available if we needed her, but discreet and non-intrusive.  Her historic home is comfortable and full of interesting antique items.  Highly recommended."
9597053,75859851,2016-05-23,59395569,Joyce,"Due to three different flight schedules -- arriving and departing -- and an itinerary devoted to all-day field trips, my party didn't actually spend much time in Karen's very comfortable home.<br/><br/>Clean and tidy, cozy and well-appointed, all was as advertised. The  location proved a convenient ""home base"" for our travels, and we particularly appreciated the peaceful neighborhood at the end of the day.<br/><br/>Karen promptly answered all questions posed prior to our arrival, and provided contact information in case we had questions or concerns once we'd settled in.<br/><br/>I'd re-visit this listing -- two thumbs up!"
9597053,76481138,2016-05-27,21566972,Colleen,What a beautiful home and warm welcome!  Thanks so much to Karen for the care she took during our stay. We had strange arrival hours and she was so accommodating and communicative.  We loved her beautiful home and will definitely reach out when we return to Salem!
9597053,77125775,2016-05-30,1854059,Mandi,"Karen was such a gracious hostess! Her home is lovely, the photos don't do it justice, and we had a fabulous weekend in Salem! Can't recommend her place highly enough - great location, quiet neighborhood and historic but comfy accommodations. "
9597053,77744360,2016-06-03,52254765,Jennifer,Karen was great. We had great privacy and very cozy
9597053,78128285,2016-06-05,18928677,Lori,"This is a great location for stores because things were in walking distance. Very quiet at night, and roomy for us. Loved it!"
9597053,79135159,2016-06-11,3481989,Amber,Very spacious and cute. Loved the location.
9597053,81003797,2016-06-20,59836996,Sandy,"Great location, very quiet. Karen is all about making your stay easy. Would definitely stay in her home again."
9597053,81532988,2016-06-23,48272447,Cathy,Thank you Karen for a very comfortable stay.  Everyone we needed was there.  Very clean and neat.  We really appreciated you invitation to use the food in your refrigerator.   We used some oatmeal and left you a jar of peanut butter.  We felt right at home.
9597053,82416050,2016-06-27,61275789,Melissa,We had a brief but very lovely stay in Salem. Karen was kind and hospitable and the room was great. We had plenty of space and the home was beautiful and charming. We plan to go back to Oregon for a longer stay. I absolutely recommend staying with Karen!!
9597053,84117965,2016-07-05,464908,Kathleen,"Very enjoyable location to enjoy Salem over the July 4th weekend.  Clean, comfortable home in a quiet neighborhood."
9597053,84802744,2016-07-09,22326054,Susie,"Thank you for opening your home to us, Karen.  It was comfortable & suited the needs of our traveling group (2 adults, 2 children) well.  The kitchen was large & well-appointed and use of the grill outside was a plus!  Viewing a deer grazing a short distance from the kitchen window the first morning was delightful.  And the grand-kids especially thank you for the delicious cookies and popsicles awaiting them.  :)     Being so close to all we wanted to see and do in Salem, it was perfect.   Thanks, again!<br/>"
9597053,85233822,2016-07-10,31042691,Sarah,"Our stay in Karen's apartment was great, though too short. The apartment was very comfortable and well-supplied. We had a chance to meet Karen when we checked in and she showed us around. She was kind and helpful and even had everything ready for us early since we had a wedding to attend that evening. We were so grateful, and would definitely recommend staying here during a trip to or through Salem. "
9597053,86117238,2016-07-15,65904634,Michael,"My stay at Karen's place felt like ""home away from home"". Many thanks for the thoughtful bouquets of flowers (hydrangea and roses) as well as all the amenities in the kitchen. I highly recommend Karen's home for the Salem traveler."
9597053,86853266,2016-07-17,47208724,Doug,"Karen's place was great. The house was very nice, we had the whole downstairs our selves. the space is separate from the upstairs living area. The decor was nice, the place was very clean and had everything we needed for our stay. The house was located very close to the downtown area and was easy access to were we needed to be. The price was very reasonable, if I need to stay in Salem again I would book Karen's again in heart beat. "
9597053,88541150,2016-07-24,68457285,Kat,We had a wonderful stay in Salem. The place was pretty much as we expected. It was very comfortable with lots of amenities. Thank you!
9597053,91076481,2016-08-03,10477353,Laura,"I can't say enough good things about Karen's place. A big attractive space, well located in Salem, very comfortable. It was perfect for us - just a couple blocks away from Ideabox, the prefab home builder, that we wanted to visit.<br/><br/>Karen was very helpful with directions and information, super sweet. Great hospitality.<br/><br/>Wonderful space in Salem and a super value - will stay here again when in Oregon, definitely."
9597053,92164850,2016-08-07,57189464,Emily,"Of all of my trips, this was the certainly best Airbnb experience I've had so far. Karen was absolutely amazing!  My friends and I came into town just a few hours before a wedding and Karen provided us with everything we needed and more (food, an iron, etc.). She even brought down fresh baked cookies for us. And though we had planned on walking to town the next day (which is very close), she insisted on driving us. I've never had a more generous host. In addition, Karen's home is perfectly placed close to town, but in a quiet neighborhood so you can expect to have a relaxing stay. In all, I would highly recommend staying here if you find yourself visiting Salem. Thanks Karen! "
9597053,94143290,2016-08-14,3774452,Blanca,"Karen was a great host. She was there to welcome us, and explained everything about the apartment. The apartment was clean and the bed & coach were comfortable. Thanks for everything we had a great time at your place."
9597053,95325812,2016-08-19,18160046,Shannon,"We loved everything about Karen's Airbnb. It was clean, large space and felt like home. Great location to downtown Salem. She left goodies in the fridge and around for us to eat which is above and beyond kind. She was very genuine and kind when we bumped into her coming and going! Would tell a friend to stay here!!"
9597053,96132833,2016-08-21,16021463,Moon,See previous comments. 
9597053,97789031,2016-08-28,8138033,Barbi,"Karen's place was even better than I imagined. ! Loved having a full kitchen with oven plus a big dining table in a seperate area . <br/>Everything felt clean and cosy and like home . Didn't have time to make the most of the big TV and read all the current magazines .<br/>Will have to stay longer next time !"
9597053,99743684,2016-09-05,1718013,Carly,"Was in town for a wedding so basically only slept at Karen's place but she was very helpful, and the house was comfortable. Beautiful fresh flowers in several of the rooms was a sweet treat! Didn't do much sightseeing but the location wasn't far from downtown Salem."
9597053,101036248,2016-09-11,38166565,Rhonda,"Karen was wonderful and very accommodating.  Her place was clean, quiet and perfect for what we needed. I would definitely stay here again."

The accommodations were lovely, comfortable, and very well taken care of.  My first Airbnb experience made me want to try my next and definitely come back."
9597053,102867419,2016-09-19,49346423,Amanda,"Thank you Karen for a wonderful stay!  The house was beautiful and peaceful.  We were able to spread out and eat our own food, thanks to the full kitchen.  We appreciated all the hosting and the amenities.  Would stay again!"
9597053,104368220,2016-09-26,73367205,Joe,The place was exactly as shown. Karen greeted us with keys to get our vacation started. We were there with a planned vacation but she offered any help or ideas if we needed them. It was an easy location in regards to traveling the different wine regions
9597053,104856377,2016-09-28,16375430,Andrew,"We really enjoyed our stay at Karen's place! It was clean, quiet, and plenty of space for us and our three year old. She even provided toys to play with which were a huge hit!"

9597053,109620043,2016-10-22,2995642,James And Seong,"Karen's house was perfect for my needs.  Tidy and well kept house with lots of lounging space, with fully stocked kitchen that I used to make my self meals.  Karen was very kind and allowed me to use basic supplies, and made sure I had everything I needed.  She answered her texts promptly, and accommodated my very late arrival with grace.  Would definitely stay here again.  Thanks, Karen."
9597053,111378468,2016-10-31,2823052,John,"The historic home was cozy, warm and comfortable. Karen was a wonderful host and made our stay very enjoyable. It was situated close to downtown shopping and restaurants and The Capital."
9597053,112622380,2016-11-06,49625487,Stephanie,Nice home in local neighborhood. Very close to downtown Salem. Host was very accessible and easy to work with. Thank you Karen!
9597053,114910385,2016-11-20,4083035,Jill,"Karen's home is cozy, spic and span! We chose this location for the wonderful access to walking/running along the Willamette River. There is a beautiful pedestrian bridge near by to cross the river into a nice park and West Salem where we could grab a cup of coffee and groceries. We also enjoyed Downtown Salem's shopping. The BEST restaurant for food from scratch:  Word of Mouth  - 5 star and as good as Grandma's!<br/>    Thank you, Karen, for your warm welcome."
9597053,117246310,2016-12-05,46886568,Joseph,"Very comfortable, pleasant accommodation! The kitchen was quite well-equipped, and Karen was a gracious host. We liked the out-of-the-way location near the river too! Will stay here again when in Salem."
9597053,120762628,2016-12-11,99890453,Claire,Karen left everything we needed and made sure we were comfortable! Very private and left us to enjoy our time!  Would definitely stay here again! 
9597053,121917801,2016-12-19,35572816,Beth,"Karen is a warm, responsive host and her home is cute and cozy. The kitchen is well stocked, the home contained everything you could want or need, and she even put out toys for our kids to play with! It was a great little location to stay at while visiting family for Christmas. We can't wait to come back when the weather is warm and walk to the park and breakfast place everyone talks about :)"
9597053,124387028,2017-01-01,37057819,Iisa,"The town of Salem is very fun! I will say you have to look hard for fun stuff to do but it is there! There is a very active night life and a mall just up the street from Karen's house. Karen is truly a kind woman and her house is a great place to stay. My husband and I enjoyed the fireplace in the living room and ordering food in :) I will say that the bed is very squeaky , there is a load bell every time the door is opened and closed, and trains pass by all hours of the day including the night, so if you are a light sleeper keep that in mind. "
9597053,128162409,2017-01-22,30469133,Callie,Karen's cute little home had all we needed for our short stay.

9597053,130704279,2017-02-07,52648901,Kathleen,"This charming vintage home is in an excellent location for either travel west, or downtown.  It is walking distance from Grocery Outlet and a great thrift store.  Though away traveling, Karen left a couple of delicious carrot cupcakes in the fridge for us, as well as necessities to get us started. We enjoyed a week of quiet, rainy days, many good meals prepared in this well-equipped kitchen, and hours of pleasure reading, naps, etc. while our daughter studied for her teacher certification tests.  It was an excellent choice for us - a home away from home!   Bruce and Katy Peet"
9597053,131115554,2017-02-10,7155464,Hayden,"Again, Karen's place is great!"

Great locations close to everything and the house was so cute, large rooms and a cozy feeling! Would defiantly stay again!"

9597053,150681088,2017-05-08,52595309,Daniel,"Karen provides a great retreat and value.  We loved the river-adjacent location, and we loved everything about the home.  Karen was available for any issues but did not intrude at all - a perfect combo for a host.  "
9597053,152476160,2017-05-16,7714973,Mark,Karen's place is in a quite spot just outside the center of Salem. She is a very considerate host and her home offers good value.<br/>
9597053,153809953,2017-05-21,130096349,Jessica,"Note this is my very first foray into the Airbnb world. I'm so glad we chose this particular listing and host - We loved staying at Karen's! We were here for a three-night weekend and couldn't have been more pleased with this lovely gem. We can't wait to stay here again! Also note that ""We"" consisted of two brothers + two wives. The only reason I say this is that from prior experience one needs to make sure that when sharing one bathroom you all get along :) The gist of this review is that we loved the house, we loved our hostess, and we would definitely stay again. 10/10 If you would like to read on though, here are some Additional details below. Getting there/Location: Easy enough with the GPS, and made even easier with ample pre-arrival communication from Karen. Roughly 8 minutes to fairgrounds, 10minutes to city center. We loved being close to everything! Oh. And it was a short walk or quick drive to either Grocery Outlet or Fred Meyers for any kind of restocking needs. The hostess: Prior to arrival, I was a bit nervous. Karen was patient enough to answer my questions and she was always relatively quick to respond. We had the pleasure of meeting her in person when we arrived. She is a gracious hostess and had put out some fresh flowers. What a nice touch! She told us a little bit about the house and we enjoyed learning a little backstory of the house prior to her purchasing it. She takes wonderful care of the place. She is always available to assist as she lived on the premises, but always gave us our space too. The home: House was clean, well-stocked, well-appointed. Separate entry to the rented space. Accurately described, homey, and charming. Bonus points for the red accents as I do love red :) Cool/hot on thermostat, fireplace, patio - loved it all. I would stay here any time of the year. Didn't get to use the TV as we were out all day and just cooked and visited with each other at night. Wifi access was quick. Some people mentioned the train. We heard it a couple of times, but it was distant enough to where it wasn't a bother to us, or we were already up. I recommend earplugs for light sleepers. Kitchen/Dining room I loved that Karen has the kitchen stocked with some basic things to get her guests started. We got in late in the evening and we're grateful to be able to make a simple breakfast the next morning - Very important when attending an all-day convention. And Yes it has a coffee maker :) we loved being able to eat in and visit at the dinner table. We hand-washed throughout the weekend but there is also a dishwasher available. Sleeping arrangements: Accurately described. We were comfortable and had lots of room to move around or hang out. For us two couples: there is a wall..."
9597053,155711483,2017-05-28,15648082,April,Our family arrived and we're so pleasantly surprised to find the house had so many wonderful things available. Karen was such a wonderful amazing hostess! She greeted us and helped us with any questions we had had. We had two kids and she graciously shared some of her grandkids toys and they loved it. Her house made out trip feel like we were home. I wouldn't just recommend this home I'm booking this again and again. Thanks Karen for being so friendly. And I only gave it 4 stars for accuracy because the pictures don't do this diamond enough justice. 
9597053,165337647,2017-07-01,119947175,Walter,"Sehr viel Platz für mich alleine, genug Raum für 4. Ruhig und komfortabel. Toller Service der nicht angeboten war. Sehr sauber und mit allem ausgestattet was selbständiges Wohnen erfordert. Auto empfehlenswert aber zur Not auch für Fußgänger machbar. 20 Minuten Fußweg ins Zentrum oder in den großen Park am Flußufer. "
9597053,166209572,2017-07-03,102435863,Amy,"We loved our stay at Karen's!  It was quiet, clean, really comfortable - a true respite for us.  We would come back any time!  Your house is lovely Karen, and we felt so at home thanks to all of your efforts."
9597053,168883863,2017-07-10,42935107,Jon,"Karen is fantastic. She has a lovely home and has everything you'll need for your stay. I had forgotten about the train nearby and had a rude awakening at 1 am but it was my own fault for forgetting. Regardless, the home is worth the value."
9597053,171097645,2017-07-16,9449214,Natalie,"Staying at Karen's place was an absolute joy and was very comfortable. I was in town for a wedding and Karen helped me get acquainted with the area and also was flexible when I had an extra guest join at the last minute. She also provided coffee, tea, and anything I needed in her spacious and beautiful kitchen with garden views. My only regret is not being able to spend more time relaxing in her beautiful home. I would definitely recommend her place to families or couples looking for a lovely and quiet place to relax in Salem. "
9597053,174035487,2017-07-24,73786675,Ling-Yen,Karen's house could not have been more ideal for our needs. There is a nice private bedroom and room for a friend to sleep in the spacious living room. The large kitchen and dining area became our common space. It is close to downtown and the park where the Salem Art Festival is held. Karen was welcoming and a great communicator. We hope to stay with her again next year.
9597053,176786422,2017-07-31,3208932,Christy,Karen's place is so lovely. It was the perfect house for out-of-town guests here for our wedding and provided me a quiet place to sleep before my wedding day! I love the open kitchen and super cute art throughout the home.
9597053,179884919,2017-08-08,5913556,Matthew,"Karen's place is an older Northwest cottage in a quiet and shady little neighborhood about a mile north of downtown Salem.  The furnishings are basic but comfortable.  Nice kitchen, quiet bedroom, the bathroom is a bit cramped.  Karen is an easygoing and generous hostess.  She made us feel very comfortable, responded promptly to communications and let us keep our gear in the house all day on the day we departed.  Her consideration and flexibility enhanced the experience for us."
9597053,183235124,2017-08-16,85487169,Alida,"Karen's home is lovely.   It's clean, cozy and has many amenities.  Tucked away across from the Willamette River, we were able to enjoy quiet early morning walks.  Just minutes from downtown and Riverfront park.   Karen was warm and thoughtful.   We really felt like this was a home away from home."
9597053,185515509,2017-08-21,133604070,Caroline,"We had a lovely stay at Karens B&B during the Solar Eclips. Our children were provided with fresh tomatoes from her garden, some games and Lego to play with. For our kids and ourselves, it was a pleasure staying at a B&B in stead of all the Hotels we stayed before."
9597053,186516834,2017-08-24,130021647,Daniel,"Comfortable hotels in Salem can be quite expensive for what they offer. Karen's place is clean, roomy and is a great value for the area. She is a great host, communicates clearly and in a timely manner. We would be happy to stay here again the next time we visit Salem."
9597053,189146448,2017-08-31,14746007,Cynthia,We loved staying at Karens beautiful place.
9597053,190255288,2017-09-03,3293448,Amy,"Karen's place was a perfect home base for our weekend adventures in Salem.  It was clean, comfortable, conveniently located, and had everything we needed.  Karen was away during our stay and she let us know we could call if we needed, but the communication was so great beforehand that everything went as smoothly as could be.  Even without meeting her, we could tell that she takes pride in her home and enjoys hosting travelers.  We appreciated that she thoughtfully put out some toys, which made our 3-year-old daughter feel so special!"
9597053,192994740,2017-09-11,131286595,Trina&Gary,"We had a comfortable 4 night stay here. Communication was great and instructions provided for easy access. Karen greeted us and made us feel welcome. The space is generously sized and parking very convenient. The house is located in more of a light industrial than residential area. Downtown is walkable (although a little further than expected) and very convenient if you have access to a vehicle. Overall, a good-value stay in Salem."
9597053,194766167,2017-09-17,9643975,Eric,Karen had good communication.
9597053,197159322,2017-09-24,126511067,Deborah,"Similar feedback to other guests.  <br/><br/>Cons are the noisy train (didn't bother me except the last night when it went by at least 6 times and blew its horn every 2 seconds) and the neighborhood doesn't feel as walkable as I had hoped.  (Industrial without sidewalks was a little intimidating for traveling.)<br/><br/>BUT, it was a great stay in Karen's home.  Everything I needed (and more) for a pleasant stay.  <br/><br/>Her communication with me prior to the stay was good.  Not too early so the email got buried and not so late that I worried that I wouldn't know how to get in or where to go.<br/><br/>Karen greeted me and helped me carry my stuff in from the car.  I know she was available if I needed anything.  (I didn't because it was all there.)  There was a welcome book with intro to the house, instructions for use and how to leave things when I left, and tips on local points of interest (as well as a whole basket of brochures of same).  Decent channel selection and on-demand for when I felt like staying in.  Centrally located to everything worth seeing (IMO) in Salem."
9597053,198238166,2017-09-28,65549284,Arnaud,The house was comfy and very clean. We had the 1st floor to ourselves. We also enjoyed the terrace and garden. Karen offered us some tomatoes from her garden. We had a lovely time in Salem.
9597053,201645307,2017-10-08,130322299,Karen,"This was a charming place to stay, with great parking and a nice location close to downtown Salem. Karen was nice enough to even make up the couch bed for us. This was an old house with its quirks, but all in all a lovely place to stay for a weekend wedding. Thanks!"
9597053,204175251,2017-10-16,134121999,Sean,"Karen made everything so easy. The house was clean, comfortable and in a good location for our daily activities."

9597053,209652063,2017-11-05,79045973,Dominic,"I was in town to run a race at Silver Falls State Park and decided to say in Salem. Karen's place was perfect. It's comfortable, spacious and has everything you need and then some. It was close to everything in Salem including some great local coffee spots and places to eat. Can't say enough about Karen as a host either. The space was available early and she also gave me the flexibility to check out a little late, much appreciated as I was moving a little slowly after running a 50k. Highly recommend Karen's great apartment if you are staying in Salem!"
9597053,211674321,2017-11-13,154121450,Lzz,"Karen has created a wonderful, homey place to stay in this historic Salem house. It’s very comfortable with a well-equipped kitchen and cozy living room and bedroom. Super grateful that there was a washer and dryer, as well!! <br/><br/>Karen’s house is very conveniently located. My sister and I️ had such a great time staying here and I️ hope we’ll have another chance to stay here in the future!"
9597053,213119453,2017-11-19,33330622,Rachel,"Karen was an amazing host, and she obviously puts a lot of thought into her place and guests. She was super friendly and always quick to respond to messages. She left helpful tips about the place and local attractions. She even shared a great story about the history of her house. Karen's place is to die for. It felt like home. It's within walking distance to the Gilbert children's museum and Salem indoor carousel. She had games available for us to play with our kiddos. There was breakfast, and good coffee. The place is bigger than I expected, and the neighborhood quiet and seemed secure. It's right down the street from the Oregon School of Massage, which was where my husband needed to be for the weekend. It couldn't have been more perfect. My five-year old even insisted we move in!"
9597053,216435650,2017-12-03,37136828,Carla,Karen's place is absolutely lovely. Very comfy and cozy. Close enough to walk to downtown Salem and close also to Willamette which is why we were there. Will stay there again for sure!
9597053,219768582,2017-12-18,37255345,Mary,"Karen's place is very cozy, and comfortable. The cottage has everything you need,  is very clean, and has many thoughtful touches.  For us it was the perfect get away."

9597053,224652758,2018-01-03,57041219,Jordan,Great Space!  Will stay again! Thanks Karen!
9597053,228449551,2018-01-19,3946440,Elizabeth,"We especially appreciated the large, well-stocked kitchen and complete laundry facilities. The house is centrally located, convenient to downtown Salem. The neighborhood is zoned commercial, and there are small businesses nearby as well as other residences along the river. It was a comfortable mix for us and a comfortable, enjoyable stay."
9597053,231150916,2018-01-30,47647666,Margaret,"Comfortable and spacious space. Quiet, warm and welcoming."
9597053,232394024,2018-02-04,75661753,Theresa,Perfect home away from home. Quiet. Exceptionally clean and user friendly. Centrally located and easy access to downtown Salem and the government offices. I highly recommend you consider this property if you are going to Salem.
9597053,235165251,2018-02-15,164596159,Bradley,"If your looking for a stylish, clean, and affordable place to call home for a little Karen’s is your place."
9597053,236223576,2018-02-18,10201840,Melody,"My husband and I spent two nights at Karen's place. The space fit our needs well and was more spacious than I expected. The location was a mix of industrial, apartments, and cute neighborhood very close to the river. This was our first visit to Salem. It would easily accommodate an additional couple with plenty of privacy for everyone. The coffee she provided was great and directions were very clear and organized. Overall we enjoyed the space."
9597053,240403071,2018-03-04,2995642,James And Seong,"I have stayed at Karen’s place many times. The apartment is very spacious, comfortable and clean. The full use of the well stocked kitchen makes it my first choice when working in Salem. Karen is super responsive and accommodating."
9597053,242711821,2018-03-12,91450340,Renee,Karen was a thoughtful host and provided everything we needed for a comfortable stay! The location was very convenient for our frequent back and forth visits to Willamette University. A great place for WU parents!

9597053,250589481,2018-04-05,73862897,Brian,Great hospitality from Karen. She made my family and I feel welcome and even brought out some toys for our kiddos. Her home was charming and conveniently located near the AC Gilbert museum and not too far from downtown Salem. Definitely recommend staying here if you bring the family or some friends. Thanks Karen for opening your home to us.
9597053,252232084,2018-04-09,52595309,Daniel,"Karen is a great host, and her place is spacious and well-equipped, especially the kitchen.  It's a quick drive to downtown and Willamette Univ.  And we really enjoy all the charming touches throughout the home."
9597053,252934577,2018-04-12,24386598,Anne,Lovely little cottage close to Downtown Salem. It was perfect for our short stay to visit my son. We had a medical emergency in the middle of the night and it was only 8 minutes from the most amazing hospital. Karen greeted us on our arrival and check in was super easy.
9597053,254141590,2018-04-15,139152161,Kevin,"Perfectly hospitable, nicely decorated and very clean, incredibly gracious and thoughtful host."
9597053,255829967,2018-04-21,33000094,Bessie,Karen's home is simply charming! We loved our stay there. Karen greeted us warmly and gave us plenty of privacy. Take the time to read the few notes in the guest book and learn the history of the house and the fun quirks of the home. A great place to stay for our family of four!
9597053,261696598,2018-05-06,185225333,Addison,Karen is a very sweet host and went out of her way to make our stay as comfortable and smooth as possible. Highly recommend!
9597053,262702131,2018-05-09,146532533,Hope,Interesting space with great touches that was like a scavenger hunt for the neat things. <br/>Well appointed. <br/>Quiet neighborhood right off the main roads.
9597053,264767652,2018-05-14,7323845,Valerie,"Great location and lovely space.  Just be aware that the plugs in the bedroom don't work once you turn off the lights for the night--you have to charge your devices accordingly (or in another room).  This is a complete house for someone who wants to cook, entertain a small group, or have an extended stay, but it's also great for a short visit."
9597053,265924708,2018-05-18,136834278,Bryon,The place was wonderful. Exactly what we needed. The host was really attentive to some needs and was happy to help. Can't say enough good things.
9597053,270308774,2018-05-28,90722391,Rebekah,A comfortable home. A warm and kind host. Great location.
9597053,272642107,2018-06-03,130096349,Jessica,"It was our second time staying at Karen’s, and it’s still one of our favorite places to stay in Salem! So close to everything, about a mile to most spots we needed to be, but away enough to be quiet and relaxing. "
9597053,276101456,2018-06-12,14761202,RaeAnn,"Great place to stay. A hop, skip and jump from downtown Salem.  A++"
9597053,278333990,2018-06-17,118397224,Stephanie,Karen's place is welcoming and inviting. Interesting history on the house. Everything needed was provided.
9597053,279835715,2018-06-21,111021516,Allison,Wow. A beautiful home in a beautiful setting. I was lucky enough to be present on a day where the lawn had been freshly mowed. I say this because there is an abundance of mint in the yard and it made the outside (and inside if the window was open) smell so lovely like fresh mint. Karen was a delightful host and gave me the privacy I needed as I was on a work trip. It is a historic house that has an interesting story and a couple quirks (hence the less than 5 stars on the amenities). Other than that I highly recommend this home to anyone who stays in Salem for business or for pleasure. Thank you for hosting me and sharing the beautiful space with me!
9597053,280669272,2018-06-23,340861,Kelly,Had a great stay. Everything as described. Will definitely book again.
9597053,282554910,2018-06-27,191905646,Josie,"It was a lovely stay. we weren't sure about the neighborhood at first but we ended up just loving it! it really felt like home. The minty smell to the lawn, the rogue rabbits eating clover in the yard, the guy walking his cats down Water street, the river, the moss....it was truly magical. Thoughtful touches and helpful brochures plus extras at every turn made this a wonderful place to stay!"
9597053,284630795,2018-07-01,6455904,Anna,"Karen's place was clean and spacious and had everything we needed, including breakfast snacks and coffee. Sitting on the back deck and checking out the gorgeous view of the river was the perfect start to our 2 mornings there. We would definitely stay again!"
9597053,288454390,2018-07-09,156938544,Dayna,"Our stay at Karen’s cozy home was perfect! We had a couple accommodations that she worked with, and we were so grateful! She goes out of her way to make sure your stay with her is as perfect as she can get it! Definitely recommend her and will be staying there again! Thanks Karen! <br/>Dayna"
9597053,290061370,2018-07-13,39253157,Jonathan,"Really nice space. Clean/ well maintained.  Two beautiful decks and the river is a half-block away. Salem is charming and the downtown is a really short drive/ 15 minute walk to the Broadway district/ 25 minutes to downtown. There is some warehouse district feel just a 2 block from her place, so you may not want to walk at night, but the location was great for getting around Salem. "
9597053,291426456,2018-07-15,122032765,Rick,"Close to the river, nice place to stay. "

9597053,586377890,2020-01-01,319703330,Leanna,Karen’s place is awesome. Comes with a washer and dryer and check in was super easy. Karen was really responsive to messages and super thoughtful when it came to extra amenities.

9597053,598704337,2020-01-27,257798273,Scott,This is a charming home. It has everything you will need for your stay.
9597053,620236683,2020-03-21,235803897,Zoha,"I had the pleasure of staying at Karen’s home for almost a month. Her home is very spacious and has everything you can possibly need. My original stay was planned for 2 months, but my time had to be cut short due to coronavirus as my internship ended much sooner than I anticipated. Karen was very understanding of my difficult situation and communicated with me & provided me with a refund for the nights I did not stay at her place. I’m so grateful to have met Karen and I hope to reconnect with her in the future once coronavirus goes away! Thank you, Karen!"
9597053,621289025,2020-03-29,212910907,Evan,Nice and cozy.
9597053,626033028,2020-05-24,70872073,Erik,The house is located near the downtown and it’s clean and have everything you need.<br/>Karen is so nice and reply very soon.

9597053,629285259,2020-06-13,182081309,Christiana,This home was perfect and quiet. Exactly what I needed this week in Salem.
9597053,631866135,2020-06-24,51470659,Eric,Nice place. Wonderful host.
9597053,633859843,2020-07-01,52480029,Wayne,"Great place, Old home charm, close to everything."
9597053,635165071,2020-07-05,1559859,Kale,"1927 first floor house with wood floors, full kitchen, dining area, living room and a separate bedroom made for a wonderful stay.  Karen, the host, lives upstairs and is readily available if you need help.  She also gives ""space"" to her guests so it is a perfect combination.  Located a block off the river, there are plenty of birds to occupy your time when sitting on the back deck.  As with all older homes, it provides plenty of charm and character.  We will definitely come back."
9597053,637489057,2020-07-12,215080026,Brandon,Karen is a friendly and accommodating host with a comfortable and roomy place with everything needed for a short or a long stay.
9597053,640588245,2020-07-20,349577076,Stacy,"This property was clean and located in a quiet <br/>neighborhood.  Location is close to downtown, shopping and great restaurants with outdoor dining."
9597053,642311351,2020-07-25,55781536,Megan,"Karen is a wonderful host.  The location was great for us and having access to a full kitchen was perfect. The dishwasher is a bonus! Thoughtful touches included a fan in the bedroom, breakfast provisions and easy parking.  Would stay again!"
9597053,644823573,2020-07-31,71376940,Aurora,Nice older home with character and stories! Very clean and close to downtown and water front. Karen is wonderful host.
9597053,652878152,2020-08-17,358699199,Michelle,A comfy stay in a quaint home. The accommodations were great! The kitchen has all necessary supplies and a few extras. The patio has a great view of Karen's garden and the nearby river.
9597053,656167415,2020-08-24,92634298,Katherine,"Karen’s home is a lovely home away from home. It has everything you need and it is very comfortable. It is close to the Willamette River, near a wonderful park, but having a car or plan on using Uber is to get around."
9597053,661320395,2020-09-06,22468263,Virginia,"Karen has a beautiful home that is clean and cozy! The downstairs was just for us and it was perfect. We loved being able to sit out on the back porch and the area has some nice streets for walks! Karen wasn’t home for most of our short stay, but was so kind to give us great tips about the area! When she did come home she was very friendly but also gave us our space (we had just gotten back from a long day of exploring). I would highly recommend staying here, beautiful home and kind host!"
9597053,671881177,2020-10-06,22932707,Kayla,Karen was a great host - quick to respond and very sweet. We needed a long-term place to stay for a seasonal job and this was an excellent option. Great kitchen and living space. I also loved having an outdoor patio to sip coffee in the morning. I’d recommend having a car or expecting to use public transportation in this neighborhood. Overall great spot!
9597053,724040451,2021-01-13,24222377,Junko,Cute quaint little place close to downtown.
9597053,725537112,2021-01-19,79296115,Amy,"My kids and I were in Salem for a few days to take my son to college. We felt very welcomed and very comfortable in Karen’s home. We appreciated having access to a full kitchen and the washer/dryer. Karen is a very gracious host and was accommodating with some last minute changes to our schedule. Although we were not able to take advantage of the outdoor patio, sitting at her dining room table in the mornings with the sunlight shining in was a real treat!"
9597053,734126743,2021-02-24,135811529,Greg,I came here to recover from shoulder surgery could not be at home because of fire damage in my community. Karen and Rocky have been kind and gracious this last month. Her home is in a quiet neighborhood by the river close to shopping.  Thank you Karen
9597053,736304837,2021-03-04,135811529,Greg,Great house for me as I was recovering from shoulder surgery.  Quiet location by the river. Karen and Rocky were awesome hosts
9597053,741252428,2021-03-21,274114960,Kathy,This was a wonderful little house. It's got the charm of a 1920s house and also a very cozy feeling.  It reminded me of all the time I spent with my grandmother and great aunt.  The location is quiet with a great view of the Willamette River.  So centrally located we were not more than 10 minutes from anything in Salem.  We will definitely stay again.
9597053,752878417,2021-04-28,13975683,Carol,"This is a lovely house.  Karen is very good at providing a homey feeling.  The accommodations are superb from the spacious kitchen, comfortable dining and living area,  to the luxurious bed which for this old body (age 72) was a treat.  The location was also great in that it is about a mile and one-half from the downtown area.  It is also quiet."
9597053,754293656,2021-05-02,396557839,Michael,"A charming, comfortable home with nice views of the Willamette River and a lovely host."
9597053,756840737,2021-05-09,212855980,Miranda,"Karen’s home was a wonderful place filled with charming touches throughout. <br/>It was excellent to stay here and keep a somewhat normal routine while visiting Oregon from out of state. <br/>The stay was quite and calm. <br/>Karen was a delight and I felt that our interactions were pleasant. <br/>When I unavoidably come back to Salem, OR I will stay here again."
9597053,759217888,2021-05-16,195835551,Andrew,"Great place to stay! Near the river, super close to downtown, quiet neighborhood. Loved it"
9597053,770813969,2021-06-15,116500615,Nancy,"If you're looking for a peaceful, quiet environment that is located within walking distance to the Salem downtown area, this is the place to be. The host is kind and offers a super-clean dwelling with plenty of privacy and plenty of supplies for cooking. Washer/dryer on site."
9597053,398569212844173135,2021-07-03,76589497,Michelle,"Fresh flowers, comfortable bed, relaxing back porch where you can see the river.  Great way to start my vacation!"
9597053,402184102616211644,2021-07-08,278620785,Jasmine,"Very tidy, communicated well, and Karen was also very accommodating for special request. Enjoyed our quick stay in Salem."
9597053,415279090823172403,2021-07-26,327075429,Bartolome,thanks Karen.  lovely place. perfect.
9597053,431940728478772016,2021-08-18,410481403,Matthew,Awesome little place that is near everything especially if you are going to explore the greater area.
9597053,436980336811827335,2021-08-25,84174193,Ivan,"Cozy, clean and close to everything Salem has to offer. A very quiet neighborhood that offers some great views of the river. Definitely would stay here again."
9597053,441279888758226948,2021-08-31,227515237,Daniel,What a lovely landing pad for it trip! Thoroughly enjoyed our time here!
9597053,445008498179052890,2021-09-05,23254957,Megan,"A fine place to stay for one night, but I wouldn’t call it cozy or clean. An old house that’s split with the host living above you. (10pm quiet time). <br/>Karen was very nice and we appreciated her hosting, but the house wasn’t in a walking neighborhood or near anything particularly nice to be near. Bees outside made the outside porches not useable and the half eaten food in the fridge and on the shelves was uncomfortable with covid being on the rise in the area. <br/><br/>Overall, like I said, not for cooking or getting comfortable, fine as a one night on the road kind of place."
9597053,449972186431572356,2021-09-12,220727219,Rachel,"Karen was a great host! Awesome communication throughout the whole stay, very welcoming, the place was exactly as described and pictured! Clean and homey! If we come back to Portland will definitely try to book here again. :)"
9597053,458689644850837152,2021-09-24,407643448,Cassandra,"Great space and amenities, with a wonderful hostess who was very welcoming. Once of the most comfortable beds that I've slept in while on vacation. Thanks for everything!"
9597053,465225317740778722,2021-10-03,159858540,Bonnie,"This home is so private, the guest has the whole downstairs, while the owner/host lives upstairs. Since I am a single woman traveling along, safety was a major concern & I felt very safe here. The home is “vintage” which I like, yet had all the modern conveniences. It was a very comfortable place to stay for 4 nights. Host Karen is very friendly and helpful. The location is also excellent. Would definitely stay here again."
9597053,471710898200248648,2021-10-12,420603947,Julie,"Karen's home is spacious, clean and comfortable.  Everything is as stated. and more.  I would be pleased to stay there if I ever get the chance to come visit again."
9597053,521820575353924472,2021-12-20,89599807,Tina,Karen”s home is very spacious and well stocked with more than just the essentials.  Check in/out and communication was excellent.  I stayed for a week and would definitely stay again when I come back.
9597053,527609199592234918,2021-12-28,76661950,Suzanne,We enjoyed our stay at Karen’s charming house during the Christmas holiday. The home was lovingly decorated too. We felt very at home and appreciated the cleanliness and coziness. During our stay there was a snow storm and Karen thoughtfully checked in on us to make sure we had electricity and were ok. I would highly recommend this stay; you’ll feel right at home!
9597053,564596975367101428,2022-02-17,56145961,Natalie,Charming idyllic little cottage with all the essentials host was always available
9597053,580549883786729922,2022-03-11,445609639,Nolan,Very cozy pleasant place. Karen was great
9597053,586949839819943123,2022-03-20,274114960,Kathy,This is a great place to stay.  The host is great and the accommodations are nice and cozy.  The location is close to pretty much everything in Salem.  This was the second time we stayed and we chose it because we liked it so well the first time.
9597053,647935416617884140,2022-06-12,11602656,Richard And Nancy,"Delightful stay in an a beautiful home by the River very near downtown. Spacious and comfortable living room, well-equipped kitchen, large bedroom, and two decks to enjoy morning coffee or a meal (if it doesn’t rain continuously during your time). Karen is kind and generous - we wanted to host a dinner party which she was delighted to allow. <br/><br/>This is a find - grab it."
9597053,651507818931290630,2022-06-17,393890013,Raymond,The house is very comfortable in feel and well equipped with everything you need to enjoy your stay and vacation. <br/>Karen is  easy to communicate with and personable. <br/>We had to extend our stay by a day and Karen was accommodating and understanding. <br/>Location is convenient to stores and freeways.
9597053,664554436720738189,2022-07-05,40621300,Joel,This is just like staying with one of your relatives - nice and homey.  Very nice location for everything in the Salem area.
9597053,668889890894246083,2022-07-11,76632959,Amber,"We stayed during the Ironman and the location was great. The unit is very spacious and feels private. Very comfortable bed! The shower is a bit small, so probably would not work for a large person. <br/><br/>It was hot out but the AC was always at a comfortable temperature. We were very happy with this stay. Would recommend. <br/><br/>Thank you Karen!"
9597053,680495639155801399,2022-07-27,268889573,Nelly,Beautiful home and wonderful host … she was always available and accommodating when needed. Would definitely recommend and come back here!!
9597053,689887603453822772,2022-08-09,174267045,Kathy,"Our stay was good, freeway access was easy which help us travel between Portland and Salem.  Local eating restaurants were close and had great food."
9597053,694253942110107645,2022-08-15,463309689,Elizabeth,This place was fantastic! Right in town; I would definitely stay here again.
9597053,702300850677637524,2022-08-26,340436512,Chelsea,This was a perfect place for us to stay for the week while my daughter was settling in for college. Great location for getting around town as well as getting on the highway to venture to other destinations. Would definitely consider staying again in the near future. <br/>Thank you Karen!
9597053,712356506260750471,2022-09-09,6884881,Emily,Great little house in a quiet neighborhood. The space was pretty large for our family and we were comfortable during our stay. The price was right and we'd gladly go back!
9597053,714556869069778008,2022-09-12,252195316,Rebekah,"Had to cancel last minute due to wild fires and Salem being under a level 2-3 fire watch/evacuation. I was keeping an eye on the news, asked the host for more details on the fire with no response. <br/>I decided to cancel because the news reports were not getting any better and asked host for a full refund, except for the first night/cleaning fees, etc., because I canceled the day of. <br/>Despite explaining why I felt unsafe staying in Salem, the host did not acknowledge my concerns, and told me to seek cancelation through airbnb which would only refund me half of the total price. <br/>Overall, I am very dissatisfied with the hosts professionalism. I did not even check in to the AirBnB, I was willing to pay for part of the stay and the cleaning, and they were unwilling to even talk about giving us a refund.<br/>The wildfires are obviously out of everyone's control, but I would have appreciated a bit of understanding and empathy from the host considering how far I was traveling to just have a nice vacation.<br/>I would not advise any one to stay with this host."
9597053,749326058368280984,2022-10-30,271865773,Nancy,"This is a charming, quirky and comfortable place and Karen is a great host.  I hope I find an excuse to return."
9597053,756632002214505144,2022-11-09,218916316,Megan,Karen was a great host! The place was clean and exactly as advertised. Highly recommend.
9597053,770411989432702082,2022-11-28,407882731,Clare,"Karen is as lovely and engaging as her warm and comfy living room and bedroom. Sitting by the gas fireplace on a typical Oregon fall evening was cozy. The bedroom was nicely appointed and the bath and kitchen (and office) were as well. Thank you for the delicious coffee and cream. <br/>I appreciated Karen’s explicit description of the stairs and the shower. Although I had no issues,  as a”person of age” it was important to know in advance. <br/>Thank you for sharing your lovely space and for making me feel so welcome."
9597053,795023220325779411,2023-01-01,7700878,Jeff,It was a very comfortable and cozy place. The kitchen was surprisingly easy to cooking. Some of the furniture could use updating.
9597053,816192296364375704,2023-01-30,296401427,Amanda,"My flight got delayed so I didn’t arrive until 1:30 in the morning and I was exhausted. I had no problems getting in and the place just like the pictures, clean and ready. Karen was a helpful host."
9597053,824006280292097762,2023-02-10,476974981,Dawn,"This location was nearly perfect for my needs while visiting Salem. Very quiet street near the Willamette River on the NE side of town, short drive to downtown Salem. The upstairs suite is a great intro to old historic homes. Living area with a full size firm sofa bed. Bedroom with a queen-size memory-foam mattress, a small kitchen and a bathroom with 2 sinks. The kitchen has everything you need for food prep. The living room has a cozy gas fireplace. The suite is full of eclectic decorative touches, plus many books, tourist info, some games. I didn’t get to spend time with host Karen, but when we met she was very nice. A few things to note: as is common in very old houses, the entrance to the upstairs suite is a narrow staircase, with stair treads that are narrower than those we are used to in new homes. Bathroom shower is set up in a small claw-foot tub, the somewhat confined space may be challenging to guests who are larger or with mobility limitations. I really enjoyed my stay!"
9597053,833493996803694659,2023-02-23,269761089,Faith,Beautiful home! I would highly recommend! Thank you so much for your Kindness Karen! We are in Japan now
10074172,60443308,2016-01-23,40198114,Brent,"Nick was responsive, inviting and professional. The pictures don't do the place justice. It's actually nicer in real life. How many times does that happen!? The bedroom, as well as the entire house, is extremely clean and quiet. The neighborhood is charming and a nice walk to the heart of Salem. I would stay here again anytime. In fact, I have decided to stay an extra night. <br/><br/>-Brent Wallis"
10074172,61099053,2016-01-31,50763756,Caitlin,Nick was great to communicate with. He lives out of town so I didn't get to meet him but he walked me through everything I needed to know. The security lighting outside is very comforting.
10074172,71115664,2016-04-23,7648352,Rebecca,The room was very pleasant to stay in along with the house. Nick was easy to communicate with. Great stay. 
10074172,71887366,2016-04-29,28354184,Laurence,"Not sure how you could do better for the money. Quick communication, simple instructions and a quiet night's sleep. Excellent AirB&B experience. Thanks!"
10074172,78221608,2016-06-05,6617439,Scott,"Nick was a great host and was awesome at communicating!  Every time I had a question he was very responsive.  Neighborhood was quiet and quaint and the house matched that well.  We did not spend much time there, but it was all convenient and worked very well for us."
10074172,79133748,2016-06-11,388827,Annette,"Nick was pleasant and welcoming in his communications, the house is lovely, and the neighborhood seems quiet, pleasant and safe. We had some challenges with the scented products used in the room (finally discovered the nightlight was a diffuser and un-plugged it) and the fact that there were multiple guests there, more like a boarding house, not someone's personal home. The bed was too soft for our taste as well. I'm sure it would be fine for some, but not for us."
10074172,79594876,2016-06-13,61816900,Ethan,The house was in a great location away from the hustle of busy streets. The pictures don't do the house or room justice. Clean and very inviting. I would most definitely plan to stay here again.
10074172,80537993,2016-06-18,72574726,Eric,"Everything was clean, the house was beautiful, and the neighborhood was quiet. It was great to be within easy biking distance from downtown Salem without having to stay there!"
10074172,81460195,2016-06-23,72024403,Faith,Ended up extending my stay a second night and Nick was super accommodating with an early check-in
10074172,81593092,2016-06-24,72024403,Faith,"This place was great for a brief stay - big rooms, clean, super comfy bed, and the price was perfect. "
10074172,82039250,2016-06-26,79136069,Danette,Accurate 
10074172,83055448,2016-07-01,970845,John,"Nick was a great host.  He was super responsive and made me feel welcome at every  turn.  The property was just as advertised and perfectly suited my needs and expectations.  I won't hesitate to return the next time my travels bring me to Salem, OR.    "
10074172,83446929,2016-07-03,75995680,Asha,Everything was as mentioned in the description. Nick was very responsive to my questions and accommodating for my late arrival. I would  recommend the place to anyone! :)
10074172,83703794,2016-07-04,18198514,Kishan,Nick was a fantastic host. Whole set up is easy and the house is beautiful as mentioned. Quiet roommates and everything you would need for a peaceful night. The museum of mental health nearby is fun if you have time. The word of mouth bistro recommended is one of the best breakfasts I've had. Go super early as it crowds up or if you're alone it should be fine. Such a comfy bed along with easy in and out makes this a great trip.
10074172,85060582,2016-07-10,59673629,Patrick,"As with all of the reviews that I saw, Nick and the place are great. Great old-charm house with beautiful wood accents throughout. Quiet, clean, and just as he described it. Two thumbs up!"
10074172,85113334,2016-07-10,7251620,Winifred,The room was clean and spacious. Nick was a very responsive and easy to reach. The only downfall was that the doorknob was broken and we couldnt/ didn't feel safe leaving our things in the room unmonitored with other guests and we almost got locked in our room and couldn't get out from the broken doorknob. 
10074172,85445424,2016-07-11,39088797,Sarah,This space is charming and a great space for a quick trip or maybe a week.  I plan to stay here again.  It was quiet and very clean.  Nick was very helpful at making me feel like I had everything for my stay.  <br/>Mahalo for the hospitality.  
10074172,87220499,2016-07-19,73786675,Ling-Yen,"Nick's house in Salem is spacious and clean and in a quiet, nice neighborhood. It has a great shared kitchen and dining area, and our room (#1) was roomy and we could not hear the other residents at all. We had a great stay."
10074172,88270520,2016-07-23,25871779,Simone Skovgaard,"Booked this place for my parents. They had some issues with the cleaning, so I immediately texted Nick, who took care of if it right away. Other than that the house had a perfect location and brand new appliances!  "
10074172,88705008,2016-07-25,14983196,Dora,"The host was very responsive and very prompt with messages. He messaged me with all the details needed to access the home. He also checked in with me frequently to make sure that all the needs of my party was met. <br/>The room and bathroom was beautiful! The rooms were clean and the decor was very nice. Both my mom and brother said it was their favorite place to stay out of all the places that we stayed during our Washington and Seattle trip. The house was also in a nice and safe neighborhood. <br/>I would definitely recommend this place to others and intend on coming back when I visit Oregon again. "
10074172,90216251,2016-07-31,81919275,Alex,Nick was great! Everything in the house was accurate from the listing description. House is very lovey in a pleasant neighborhood. Beautiful home.
10074172,91053933,2016-08-03,58033312,Tiffany,"Nick is great about getting back to potential guests, he was easy to communicate with and answered my emails within hours. I went for a nice run, the neighborhood has a few parks and wide streets that are perfect for running.  <br/><br/>This was the first time I've used Airbnb myself but a friend works for corporate Airbnb and I've booked them for my mother so I'm familiar with the idea. It doesn't appear that Nick lives here, which he says in the listing; there are multiple Airbnb guests staying in all the rooms. I was alone with two other men and as a single female, I didn't feel very comfortable, especially when one came home at 2:30am. I think I would have felt better if Nick had been there just in case there was a problem. I reread the reviews and noticed that a lot of the women who stayed here were with a significant other, which would have made me feel safer. So this doesn't really reflect on the place, which I would say is as described, but is good to take into consideration in case it might be an issue for you."
10074172,91481931,2016-08-05,1015064,Jackson,Great value for late reservations
10074172,92356338,2016-08-08,74185509,Derek,Nick is kind man and father.  He  will take care of any problems right away!   
10074172,93638288,2016-08-13,87996189,Laura,"I did not want to leave when my reservation was over! Nick's older home has been beautifully remodeled, but without losing the feeling of going back in time. It was nice and quiet and the gourmet kitchen was a huge plus along with the enormous outdoor space and porch swing! The room was bright and full of windows and with a great view of the trees. There were plenty of extra linens and blankets and lots of small touches.  I hope that I will have the opportunity to return or for family members to be able to stay ! "
10074172,95589225,2016-08-20,86851442,Kristian,"Nick was a great host and answered any question I had during my stay right away. <br/><br/>The room was exactly as described and shown on the pictures: Large and with easy access to a nice bathroom. The shared kitchen facilities worked out great as well. <br/><br/>The room will be perfect if you have business to do in Salem and need a place to stay. "
10074172,95923188,2016-08-21,46577148,Lizzie,The listing was very accurate and the house is just beautiful! So much space and has everything you would need. 
10074172,96576321,2016-08-23,59108866,Nichole,The room was exactly as described. Safe neighborhood.  Charming front porch swing. We only spent one night. And was just me and teen daughter. We felt comfortable even with other roommates in house.  Very clean spacious home with nice furnishings. Nick even offered that we could use laundry room which was great since we had been on the road for 4 days. Nick is very organized and accommodating as a host. Very appreciative for his flexibility and great communication. Would stay again and recommend. 
10074172,97790069,2016-08-28,86396217,Chelsea,The room was big.  The bed is super comfy.  The tentants were very nice.  The living room was quiet and comfy.  The neighborhood is quiet and very little traffic.  I was able to walk to Johnny's to get dinner.  The porch swing is a great touch.
10074172,99045875,2016-09-03,36164027,Jacky,The room was great - love the older house feel and all amenities mentioned in the listing were provided. Would definitely stay again the next time I'm in Salem!
10074172,99417272,2016-09-04,2495610,Aaron,My experience at Nick place was great. As a seasoned airbnb user with over 20 stays I think Nick is a great host that delivers all the right amenities for a smooth and comfortable stay. Thanks for making it easy. 
10074172,100146097,2016-09-07,66634450,Wendi,"Great location, beautiful home, COMFY bed! Nick was very accommodating of my 9PM reservation, arrival by 10PM. The home was clean, and exactly as it looks in the photo. I had a hard time not staring out the window at the beautiful trees as I tried to work on my computer. I will return if I am in the area."
10074172,100697450,2016-09-10,20100961,Alex,"The room was exactly as described in a very quiet neighborhood. Nice place, I would stay here again. "
10074172,100995486,2016-09-11,56595,Aristide,"Nick was very communicative, professional and friendly. He provided all the information needed and was quick to answer my emails.<br/><br/>The place is about one mile from the fairgrounds and about one mile to downtown. It's two blocks from the #10 bus. "
10074172,102126227,2016-09-16,12694929,Judith,"Lovely house in good,  convenient neighborhood. Although Nick was not at the house, he replied quickly to questions by text.  Really nice to be able to do a load of laundry there - thanks, Nick!  Great location for easy bike access to downtown Salem. There is a train that goes through multiple times a night nearby, though, so bring good earplugs."
10074172,108127365,2016-10-14,50545489,Landon,Great location and nice place to stay.
10074172,109288402,2016-10-20,7468975,Karsten,Nice Room in quite neighborhood. There where other guests lodging there but I did not even see them during my stay. Will come back if traveling to Salem again .
10074172,112916398,2016-11-08,69091237,David,"The home is clean, comfortable and easy to use.  The shared kitchen and sitting room are very nice.  I arrived after 11 PM, stayed for 5 nights.  However everyday I left by 7 AM and returned about midnight so I did not meet my host.  However I texted and e-mailed and they were a responsive host."
10074172,115430773,2016-11-24,102013679,Terry,Great place for a great value. Close to downtown and east side with shopping mall and restaurants.

10074172,120329017,2016-12-09,105876276,Rose,This place is super conveniently located to the downtown. I was able to walk and bus everywhere I needed. There is food and other resources nearby. The bed was fabulously comfortable and I slept well each night.

10074172,134730208,2017-02-28,11677038,Matthew,"Really clean, updated home close to downtown Salem. Definitely possible to walk to anywhere in downtown (it's about a mile out). Hosts were great, very polite, and the home is extremely quiet. I was here for a month and had a wonderful stay. "
10074172,135694489,2017-03-05,52280737,Erin,"BEAUTIFUL home! Charger cables, in-room fridge, desk, comfortable bed and the most amazing bathroom! Very comfortable, quiet, convenient, and the hosts were very communicative! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! "
10074172,136280883,2017-03-09,2252516,Dennie,Very nice clean and quiet location in a nice residential neighborhood. High quality furnishings and improvements in an early 20th century home. Well done.
10074172,139494010,2017-03-25,62637632,Jeff,Quiet place to work.

10074172,140776557,2017-03-31,2252516,Dennie,"Nice and quiet, clean, convenient to city center but also in a nice older historic neighborhood"
10074172,142348245,2017-04-07,42854168,Debbie,"Was in Salem to visit Willamette University. This place was quite close. I drove to campus, but I imagine someone could walk to campus if you had to get by without a car."
10074172,142908389,2017-04-09,34676098,Laura,"Nick and Julie made my stay as easy as possible. While I did not see them, they were very prompt in responding to my questions that came up the first night I was there. The description of the room was very accurate with great instructions on how to access Keys. Having the kitchen space was very nice. There were plenty of pots and pans with clear notes on what was in each cabinet and drawer. Very close drive to downtown Salem. If I had wanted to I would have been able to walk there in about 30 minutes. Other guests were personable, but they kept mostly to themselves."
10074172,143643391,2017-04-12,12499722,Kevin,"Nick's place was exactly as described, clean, comfortable and a great place to stay if you are in Salem, Or."
10074172,149672683,2017-05-05,109358452,Joshua,"This was a great experience. I was traveling on business for a month and this house was perfect. Comfortable, clean and located in a great area. "

10074172,151230886,2017-05-11,51934592,David,Clean tidy spacious house in a quiet street.
10074172,152272800,2017-05-15,20629435,Dorothy,"I was expecting ""a room"" but what we got was a spacious room in a beautiful house that was very quiet. Check in was easy, and we saw so little of the permanent residents we felt we were by ourselves. We were quite jet lagged and they were very tolerant of our dozing on the couches in the living room. "
10074172,155692348,2017-05-28,48679822,Cy," Very clean, comfortable room, nice kitchen. All was just as described very happy with this stay."
10074172,158643290,2017-06-07,123050841,David,Really nice clean room provided everything needed for a nice nights stay. Comfortable bed very clean place I enjoyed my stay here & would recommend it to others.
10074172,159085981,2017-06-09,19046260,Mary,Beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood.  I needed to check in late because of work and Nick was very accommodating. Will definitely stay again!
10074172,160834011,2017-06-15,72332844,Raymond,"Salem means peace and that's what you will find here. Nested in a canopy of older mature valley trees, Nick's house provides the calm, quiet and sense of nature on this street of trees. Nick's house has plenty of natural wood and modern historical charm and creates a further sense of rest. A great place to naturally unwind after a day of go, go ,go. Great Kitchen and rooms with a view of trees. Clean and well stocked with the basics so it feels like home. Thank You Nick."
10074172,161357504,2017-06-17,132154385,Kim,"Nicks home is gorgeous! It's clean, tidy and cozy! We would stay again! Thank you Nick :)"
10074172,165702841,2017-07-01,130768948,Bob,Nick's place is exactly as represented.  Quiet & clean.  Every night is a good night's sleep. Would happily stay there again. <br/>
10074172,166886882,2017-07-04,68574395,Kristen,Nick was a really great host and resolved any issues we had promptly. The house was clean the bathrooms are nice. 
10074172,167759887,2017-07-07,60964197,Mayuri,"Wonderful house, the host was communicative and helpful at all times. The bathroom although shared is not an issue at all, the housemates were friendly and quiet. "
10074172,168606281,2017-07-09,19046260,Mary,"I travel to Salem often for work. This was my third stay at this location and I was very happy. My room was clean, quiet and comfortable as always. "
10074172,169805763,2017-07-13,8753649,Cheryl,"Nick's place was great.  The house is really beautiful. The room was well situated with a  very comfortable bed, and a desk. The shared bathroom was available whenever we needed it.  Coffee on the porch  swing was a real treat."
10074172,171104462,2017-07-16,21060964,Carrie,Great place if you're looking for privacy but don't want to pay for an entire home. Clean and comfy.
10074172,172077982,2017-07-19,140833978,Jenny,"Beautiful home, older quiet neighborhood, walking distance to great food and family friendly parks. Patty's off center Cafe has amazing food and service. I would stay again with my baby. "
10074172,174006675,2017-07-24,16480582,Gene,"They don’t live there. The house is furnished, but I’ve felt more warmth in houses “staged” by realtors. Four guest rooms, one bathroom. Because the hosts don’t live in the house, there is no-one to tell the bathroom sinks are draining slowly, or to ask for a second towel (we paid for 2 people). The whole experience was very impersonal. There’s wifi, but no TV. Due to the weather, the room was very warm. Again, no-one to ask about a fan. We sighted some other guests, but they passed like ships in the night.<br/><br/>Near as we can figure, the location is not walking distance of anything useful, like restaurants, or stores, so you need a car.<br/><br/>We have enjoyed the company of several hosts, but for the most part our Airbnb experience is like this: someone turning an unsuitable home into a commercial rooming house. And the “breakfast” of the Airbnb name? Forget it, please refer to the “they don’t live here” comment above."
10074172,180226056,2017-08-09,33453768,Nancy,The home is comfortable enough for a night's stay.  Be sure to have a flashlight if you arrive after dark so that you will be able to see to pen the lock box and to see key holes on door and to see and verify the house number.  There were no exterior lights on when we arrived.
10074172,180951524,2017-08-11,64970000,Brandy,"A nice, quiet place close to popular activities."
10074172,182077191,2017-08-13,44885746,Chihiro,"Due to an emergency situation, I had to drive over night and needed a clean,  safe, and convenient place to sleep one night to rest for another long drive.  <br/><br/>I found Nick's place and I booked less than 24 hours to check in time.  Nick responded and confirmed right away.  Location was convenient, room was clean, check-in was easy.    <br/><br/>Nick, Thank you for being a great host!"
10074172,185108454,2017-08-20,32019469,Susan,"This Airbnb was a perfect fit for our needs. The location was close to downtown Salem, yet situated in a quiet neighborhood. Hosts answered all of our needs promptly. We really enjoyed their awesome home."
10074172,196591259,2017-09-23,122249034,Shantel,A magical view and restful stay! Thank you!
10074172,201663907,2017-10-08,14736862,Todd,"Although Nick is not on site, he is very responsive to any inquiries you might have.  It is very quiet, clean, and the bed was very comfortable.  As others have noted, the interior is a bit stark - not very cozy in regard to home furnishings.  Has great potential though.  Great if you are there primarily for a place to sleep.  Nice kitchen."
10074172,203861100,2017-10-15,75746932,Bailey,Nick’s place was a fair value. This room is private with a lock. Comfy bed. It is very close to the road thus this is not a good choice if looking for a quiet place to stay. Host was not on site and I had mild issues with cleanliness of the shared bathroom. Friendly guests in other rooms. It was good for a quick stop along a road trip. If I go back to Salem to stay for longer I will choose another location.
10074172,238965727,2018-02-27,174505717,Subhakar,Great place for new people. Close to everything.
10074172,247215668,2018-03-27,179601645,Tyler,Nick had very good communication and responded to any questions we had and was even 0kay with us checking in late. The long term residents are also very nice
10074172,250945845,2018-04-06,181080761,Paul,"Nick's place was amazing! It was in a great location outside of downtown Salem. Communication was awesome throughout the experience, and good advice for food was also given. Definitely recommend!"
10074172,251334407,2018-04-07,6006802,Jennifer,"Nick really helped me out with my super late inquiry after my original host had administrative issues precluding my stay.  Nick had the room prepped and ready in short order.  The historical house is interesting.  Upstairs two other long term tenants share the one bath with airbnb guests.  It works and the bathroom is good sized. The room is very useable with a desk.  There are several pillows to use. The sheets seem new.  I like the no shoes in house policy, it keeps the floors clean.  The kitchen is available for the guests. <br/>The street is mostly quiet at night.<br/>I was well rested for the next day's events."
10074172,257079994,2018-04-24,94880927,Daylena,"Very quiet residential area, near parks, hospital, numerous & diverse eating establisments and shopping. There are a couple longer term type residents, but I rarely saw them and when I did, they were friendly & polite. The room was nicely sized and the bed was COMFORTABLE! Good communication / information from the hosts. Overall this was a very good value and I  would stay again."
10074172,257335080,2018-04-25,67681672,Todd,Good location and nice host.
10074172,264805395,2018-05-14,17692480,Matsu,"Nick's location was convenient for our plans. There are 4 bedrooms upstairs in an old craftsman home with one bathroom we all shared. We were very lucky as everyone was very considerate. There was no problem sharing the bathrm. Everyone kept it clean for the next person. There is a beautiful kitchen that seemed stocked with pots and pans and dishes although we did not use it. There is also laundry facilities.  Wifi was difficult to sign into and no one to ask. It wasn't a big deal for us though, so much so we didn't even try to get in touch with Nick to see if he could help.  If you decide to stay here think big beautiful craftsman home with a  group house living feel. Things were organized and there were extra blankets.  Very comfortable but a bit sterile. We liked it because we had specific plans and knew what we were dong in Salem. We could come and go freely without interacting with anyone. That might sound a bit rough but we were scheduled out and on overload for the weekend. It worked perfect for us. Also the late check out time was helpful. Thanks Nick for letting us check in early."
10074172,267476780,2018-05-21,188172853,Shilpa,Nice place to stay.
10074172,273629460,2018-06-06,31799660,Krystal,"If you're staying in Salem, this house has all the amenities you might need located in a nice neighborhood. Easy check-in and check-out, and It seemed like 4/4 rooms of the home were Airbnbs."
10074172,274272530,2018-06-08,127545790,Tyson,The house was amazingly beautiful. Definitely a piece of architectural beauty. It was an easy check-in and I was able to arrive and quickly get to my room to get settled. It was very close to where I needed to be and to downtown Salem. I would definitely stay again.
10074172,275805692,2018-06-11,193952274,Ryan,"The house is a bit creaky, but that's just part of the appeal of an older place. The neighbor's dog might be annoying at night sometimes, but otherwise this was a great place to stay! One thing for the taller guests. I'm about 5'8 and walking down the stairs from my room I could bang my head on the weirdly low part of the ceiling if I didn't turn my head to the side. If you are any taller than me, you will have to duck every time you walk down the stairs so be careful! You won't have any other problems staying here."
10074172,277684282,2018-06-17,190219821,Brittany,Only reserved for a hot tub which was on the list of amenities but the hot tub was a bathtub with jets that wasn’t clean and was shared with a shower the roommates were using right before me. Just not as expected. 
10074172,278349760,2018-06-17,140624235,Haley,"Very quite home, a person lives their full time, said hi a few times but wasn't a social or homely place. "
10074172,285088320,2018-07-02,197172717,Yashwanth,Very nice and calm place to stay
10074172,289166840,2018-07-11,188545905,William,"This is a very nice, quiet place. I highly recommend it. Great location."
10074172,291345293,2018-07-15,173244760,Enrique,"Nice place to stay, bed is comfortable  and in a nice neighborhood"
10074172,292757721,2018-07-18,157058372,Michelle,Highly recommended! You won’t be disappointed. 
10074172,297961456,2018-07-28,196672702,Brett,Thank you!
10074172,301751151,2018-08-04,11677038,Matthew,"Great place to stay! Nice house close to downtown, very quiet"
10074172,306536367,2018-08-12,206925368,Lisa,this is a great place
10074172,307136529,2018-08-13,183242127,Rena,The house is very nice. The furnishings are a little threadbare. The shared bathroom can sometimes be a problem. Good location to downtown. 
10074172,308568457,2018-08-16,16586216,John,Very straightforward experience which is what I’m after with Airbnb. All was as Nick said in the advertisement. 
10074172,309801277,2018-08-18,183242127,Rena,"This is a nice old house, with a good location to the downtown area.  The bathroom is shared among 3 rooms, which can sometimes be a problem. The furnishings in the rooms could be a bit more comfy and inviting."
10074172,310692243,2018-08-19,83584079,Jim,Nice house in a quiet neighborhood. Pretty close to the downtown area and the Willamette River trail. 
10074172,312554682,2018-08-23,5165657,Nicole,This room was exactly as described. The space was clean and the sheets and bed were amazing! I was super grateful for the air conditioner because Salem was so hot while I was there. I didn’t get to enjoy the space as much as I could have. The hosts were quick to respond and I was able to stay there when another situation fell through unexpectedly. Very Thankful For the quiet peaceful space. 
10074172,314500985,2018-08-26,23350045,Ann,Convenient and clean.  Shared bathroom with seems up to 3 other rooms so timing can be tricky but also half bath downstairs.  Easy to get in and house is very nice.  Bed was comfy and set up in Room #1 to have a child or 3rd person with futon on floor which worked well for us.
10074172,315391428,2018-08-28,25620333,Phil,Another great stay at Julia and Nick’s place. They’ve re-decorated the bedroom and made it even nicer. Julia was very helpful with modifying my reservation when I needed to change it.  
10074172,317889155,2018-09-02,198246248,Ben,"Very nice kitchen to cook in. It was fully stocked with pots, pans, utensils and spices."
10074172,323494806,2018-09-15,196500858,Theresa,The house is close to downtown in an older neighborhood with lots of charm.<br/>The inside has been updated nicely.  <br/><br/>Just know there is no host at the house and you will be sharing a bathroom with tenants plus other guests. <br/><br/>It worked for me as I was traveling on business.
10074172,333041017,2018-10-06,145159413,Vamshi,You can prefer it without any hesitation

Nick provides a top notch place to stay that's clean, friendly, great location, and all the necessary amenities. It's an excellent place overall and a great value with everything you get. I will be happy to stay there again if the opportunity arises."
10074172,439809874,2019-04-19,1291185,Stephen,"Nick’s place was prefect! Great location, clean and quiet, and quick response times from the host. I would definitely recommend staying."

10074172,459037897,2019-05-26,102633716,Debbie,Great location for going to concerts at LB Day Amphitheatre or the Oregon State Fair. Bedroom was clean and had a comfortable bed. Quiet neighborhood with parking on the street. Be sure to get instructions on how to get your keys for self check-in in advance.
10074172,462096112,2019-06-01,133780925,Laura,"I was disappointed with this property. The reviews portrayed a clean and comfortable location, but the bathroom cleanliness did not meet my expectations. The home is a bunkhouse, and being it is historic, it is also very noisy and sound travels throughout. I was awakened by other occupants returning at 2am even though they were respectful in their noise levels... The noise just carries. With the Owners not being onsite and it being late when we arrived, I chose not to ask for resolution of these issues during my stay. <br/>The room was stuffy yet I was unable to keep a window open due to noisy street neighbors. <br/>This property was not a good fit for me and I would not recommend."
10074172,470050863,2019-06-15,24024974,Tamara,Nice location.

10074172,474091542,2019-06-22,3009569,Bonnie,Quiet. Wifi good. 4 bedrooms sharing one bathroom. Lock on bedroom door very difficult to work. Only a small sliding latch for locking door from inside.
10074172,478306830,2019-06-29,64069506,Casey,"Easy check-in, spacious kitchen, mutliple bathrooms. My only quibble is that the walls/floors do not insulate noise very well."
10074172,480936507,2019-07-03,64069506,Casey,"Easy check-in, spacious kitchen, mutliple bathrooms. My only quibble is that the walls/floors do not insulate noise very well."

10074172,639565569,2020-07-18,304122636,Susan,Good location to access downtown Salem.  Not as clean and fresh as it could have been.  Each bedroom upstairs locks with a skeleton key.  I'm not sure how safe and secure that is.

10074172,394896665074365641,2021-06-28,7168780,Valerie,Five different rooms here and best in my mind is the larger #3 upstairs.  #4 is nice as well  as #5 downstairs with its own bathroom. Other two are pretty small but cute!  Its like a rooming house and owners do not live on site.   Shared bathroom can get busy upstairs in the mornings.
10074172,401475210099477250,2021-07-07,351952643,Adrena,Will love the house and area

10074172,673312638847182537,2022-07-17,469725787,Jesse,"Room had a couple spiderwebs/spiders. If you want coffee bring your own K-Cups. Picture shows they had a lot but when I stayed there was only one. Lots of tea options however. No drinks allowed in the room. The mattress seemed like a really firm memory foam. Decent neighborhood, close to pretty much everything. They also provide nearby food options."
11362008,70055430,2016-04-15,66827675,Rithy,Christy was very welcoming and accommodating for my short stay!
11362008,70177207,2016-04-16,50393168,John Kelly,"I stayed for 6 nights and 7 days.  Christy took to opening up her home with the greatest of ease and a resounding effortlessness that was received on my end with deep appreciation.  From the inexpensive room to the offering of her car and taking me up to the local market for food and sitting with light talk over cups of coffee was really exactly what I needed, I could not of asked for anything as nice. <br/>This was not a vacation trip, I took a Tower Crane Certification class with 2 huge exams and I would like it noted that the stressless airb&b environment played a role in my passing of class.  Thanks you Christy"
11362008,70666597,2016-04-19,67660454,Jacob,"Welcoming, and quiet neighborhood "
11362008,71990961,2016-04-30,38884117,Mio,My short stay at Christy's home was super awesome. She took me to the local bars/restaurants with her cool car and had a great Friday night. her comfy room was so clean. quiet and welcoming neighbors and cat.
11362008,72666105,2016-05-04,39872684,Gemma,Christy is very lay back and welcoming.
11362008,73247140,2016-05-07,3471456,Jesper,"Where do I get started on Christy? She's unique, one of a kind. I felt like I was staying with a friend though this was the first time we met. She showed me Salem, took me to a good restaurant and we ended up having drinks in a bar. The next day we went out again, to the saturday market. It was just great hanging out with her. One of the coolest, and yet loveliest, persons I've ever met."
11362008,74020960,2016-05-12,67791530,Bruce,"Needed a place near Willamette to rest my body for a night while I did my dad duties to move my freshman out of the dorm.  Wanted someplace safe to park my car (loaded with stuff).  Wanted someplace quiet at nite.  Wanted someplace inexpensive.  Didn't care about breakfast, fancy linen, memory foam mattress, etc...  Christy's place checked all the boxes.  Her home is a stones' throw from campus, on a quiet tree-lined residential street, which, after dark, becomes silent night.  I arrived at the appointed hour and Christy was there to greet me, having just finished giving a piano lesson to a student.  She quickly showed me around (she has a remodel so there were places that one shouldn't go).   Gave me a key, and I never saw her again.  Spent the night watching game 5 of the Warriors-Traiblazers at a nearby pub Christy recommended, met some Trailblazer fans (sorry your young team lost), and returned around 11p to a house fast asleep.  Very soon so was I.  Perfect fit for my needs.  Thanks Christy--I left the key on your dining table as we agreed, and then tip-toed out :-)"
11362008,75397946,2016-05-21,66932637,Sarah,"Christy was very welcoming. The room was small, but had drawer space, and the fold-out bed was extremely comfortable. The house is older, and has a unique and relaxed feel. Very short drive, or moderate walk downtown. There are outdoor cats (my cat allergies were not triggered, the room is cat-free) that are real sweethearts if you care to pet them- Coho was my favorite!"
11362008,76128914,2016-05-25,2343552,Roberto,"Christy was really helpful in accommodating me. Needed a place in Salem while apartment hunting and the location was perfect, central to the city and in a quiet neighborhood. "

11362008,80116909,2016-06-16,2590599,Lydia,Christy was an excellent host. She made me feel very welcome. Her house and neighborhood were quite charming.  Also she gave me some leads for finding future housing in the area.   
11362008,80153442,2016-06-16,70678207,Sarah,Rollaway on the sunporch of a craftsman in central Salem. Christy took time to get to know me and answer my questions.

11362008,81139281,2016-06-21,18664685,Shauna,"Staying with Christy is more like crashing with a friend than checking into a hotel.  The room is humble but clean and comfortable, with all the listed amenities.  Christy herself is responsive and friendly, and even gave me a ride into town.  I only stayed for one night but would have been happy to stay for longer."
11362008,84842617,2016-07-09,29635148,Thomas,"A gracious lady. Fun interaction with host(s) and guests, way beyond what presents as ""conversation"" now-a-days."
11362008,85079324,2016-07-10,37687357,Alex,Awesome house in Salem. Christy was extremely accommodating and helpful. She was able to tell me a bunch of things to do in Salem and the surrounding areas. Highly recommended.

While my visit was short lived due to a family emergency, I'm glad I met Christy as I now have a good friend in Salem. I'd strongly recommend staying here as you will always feel you are among friends and at home...."

It is a comfy home and she made my stay very easy thanks to her warm personality and helpful tips. I would recommand choosing her place if you're going to Salem without hesitation. "
11362008,128955474,2017-01-28,26978274,John,"Third time here! The place was as nice as always. Christina, Chad and I celebrated Chinese New Year together, and had some great conversation about travelling, history and politics. I will come back next month!"

11362008,130562812,2017-02-06,5851000,Jennifer,"I booked this room with Christina because it was located very close to the Person Vue testing center, where I took my exam. Christina was warm and welcoming. She was very accommodating and understanding of my need for a quiet place to rest before my exam. The room that I booked was not available but Christina had another bedroom ready for me. Her home felt cozy, comfortable and relaxed. For the price, it was well worth it. "

11362008,150691290,2017-05-08,1492286,Jim,"Within a mile or so of downtown/train station in quiet neighborhood with lots of trees.   Not a big or new house, and can get a little busy if people are around.   But on the whole pleasant stay."

11362008,155207934,2017-05-27,121779,Lisa-Marie,"Very cute home.  There's a covered porch area with seating and books.  Very friendly vibe in the home.  Shared with other airBNB guests and hosts.  If you're in the room with the cot, it's right next to the kitchen and laundry room, so expect some noise early in the morning as people get along with their morning kitchen routine/cleaning.  Otherwise the home is quiet and peaceful.  This room has windows and a door that opens to the backyard, very peaceful.  Cot is comfortable enough for a couple nights, but nothing beats a bed!  Perfect place to stay when visiting WU.  Marked this place as a favorite and hope to visit again soon.  "
11362008,157145470,2017-06-02,33644811,Sarah,Clean place to stay and was great for what I needed it for (quick night trip). Convienent location and she provided great directions on how to check in and exit.

11362008,201692813,2017-10-08,29661239,Laura,"Christina's house was a super convenient place to stay while visiting my son at Willamette University. The room has a very small, extra soft cot, but I was pleasantly surprised and got a good nights sleep. House is older with lots of character. Loved the squeaky old wood floors! Hosts were friendly and the communication excellent. Perfect place to sleep and well worth the very reasonable rate!"
11362008,202536704,2017-10-11,118433280,Chuck,"I enjoyed the place. Great value, location, and hosts. Thanks!"

11362008,204145796,2017-10-16,67791530,Bruce,"I always try to stay here when I'm visiting my daughter at Willamette.  Price, location, and friendliness of hosts really can't be beat!  I can walk to campus, the train station, and to the undisputed best breakfast in town."
11362008,204349084,2017-10-17,141242339,David,I recommend this location yo everyone. Very comfortable and nice. I felt like I was at home away from home. A++++++

11362008,208035950,2017-10-30,120484104,Timothy,"Very gracious host and felt very welcome. Loved talking to her, her husband and other guests. You share a bath/shower with others and that was no problem. Loved having access to the kitchen and felt right at home. When business plans became a bit challenging Christina gave me a late checkout which really took the pressure off me. <br/><br/>Would absolutely return!"
11362008,208513961,2017-11-01,81158609,Vincent,"If there was anyway I can give this place 6 stars, I would! Both Christina and Arnold has been such an amazing host for me.  The place was clean, internet worked fast, and the bedroom was simply homey.  I slept well through the night with no problem.  Definitely recommend this home to a friend who is looking for a spot in Salem."

11362008,211862466,2017-11-14,55724650,Thaís,"Hosts were very nice. <br/>The room was okay. Not what I expected. And theres only 1 bathroom in the house so you have to cross through the kitchen and living room to get to it. <br/>If you're trying to sleep in, you will hear people in the kitchen since its right next to it. And theres no lock on the door, so if you're looking for privacy this is definitely not the place for you."
11362008,213365881,2017-11-20,26654787,Sarah,"I didn't actually get to stay here because I booked in the wrong city.

11362008,214354414,2017-11-25,27841028,Erin,This is such a cute + cozy place for the price! Met up w my partner in Salem for a break from family festivities over holiday break and found her house easily. Key was easily accessible. Christina had coffee ready in the morning and was very kind. Will definitely stop here again if I’m in Salem.
11362008,219748616,2017-12-18,5925142,Bob,"this home is so wonderful, kind of funky which I love, central to everything I needed in Salem.  I actually had the whole house.  The rates are very reasonable.  I will recommend this airb&b to friends and of course I will be happy to stay there again if I am back in the Salem area.  Well Done!"
11362008,220293376,2017-12-21,3053884,Jane,"Comfortable, cozy, clean, and just as advertised."
11362008,220532326,2017-12-22,10061409,Angela,"Christina's place was even more comfortable than I was expecting. I just needed a simple overnight stay, and this was the perfect fit to stay central to Salem. It was easy to communicate and navigate and all my needs and expectations were met. It was even more warm and comfortable than expecting since it is an old house and the weather was freezing- but it warmed up in no time. I would stay again!"

11362008,226083625,2018-01-08,29607288,Kellie,I stayed for one night and Christina and her husband were wonderful hosts. I was in town for a quick day trip and staying with Christina made it even better!

11362008,234101081,2018-02-11,171378232,Jared,"Christy and Arnaud were wonderful hosts. Great communication from both of them, despite some unexpected challenges (unrelated to my experience). I had a very restful night and hoped that I could’ve stayed longer."
11362008,234709758,2018-02-13,126489791,Nikki,"I've stayed at Christina's place for the second time, she and husband always live up to your expectations. More so, they even offered help with transportation. I'd say hats off to their hospitality!"
11362008,235162058,2018-02-15,6746195,Jared,"OVERALL: 4.5/5 stars Pros: welcoming & inviting guests, crafty & culturally rich house, clean room/bathroom. Cons: Not so much a negative but more note -<br/> the sofabed was a little firm, could have been a tad comfier. <br/><br/>It's definitely got old house charm (creaky floors, Victorian style latches, etc.) but is comfy & filled with character. If you're in Salem & are looking for something slightly different than your average home, look here."
11362008,235171880,2018-02-15,126489791,Nikki,Christina and husband were great hosts. They offered me a ride when they find out I didn't have a car and gave me tips how to get around Salem.
11362008,235430351,2018-02-16,58926582,Kandace,Great value and cute room for a stopover in Salem!
11362008,235726660,2018-02-17,167645025,Kam,"My daughter stayed at Christine’s place to visit the local college. She couldn’t stop talking about how cute the place was. A heater and a fan to make sure ever person who stays will be comfortable. Make sure if you aren’t used to NE/SE directions that you know which one you are going to. She got dropped off at the wrong address before realizing it and had to call another Uber in the rain at 11:30pm. Address was clearly stated on the site, it was our fault. Other than that, great experience. Owners were out of town so my daughter had the place to herself. Too bad she was only there long enough to sleep. Sounded like a cozy home. <br/>We would recommend this place for sure! Five stars. Christine was very tentative to helping with arrangements and even left a neighbors number Incase we needed it. I’m grateful her home was open for my daughter to stay."
11362008,236273737,2018-02-18,84903422,Eileen,Lovely room in clean and quiet area.

11362008,240713654,2018-03-05,164833103,Brittany,"Very cute old house. Christina came up and said hi and then let us be. Room was great for what we needed. We went to bed and got back on the road the next morning. The bed was a little creaky, as was the house, but it did the trick at a great price."
11362008,241331418,2018-03-08,128596127,Jennifer,"Great little space for quick stops in Salem. Perfect for 1 as room is small but charming all around. Owners are polite and helpful. Little extra amenities are a nice touch - adapter, tissues, xtra space heater, plenty of blankets. Lovely back yard for a bit of calm. No surprises which is often underrated."

Dog friendly home, WiFi , French press for coffee, cream and sugar. Gas stove for cooking if you need to. I didn’t need much but hot water and  toast a knife, plate and a cup.<br/>Washer and dryer was new lovely to be able to was work clothes very thankful for that & iron and board were  available too. Guests may be a few in house ask if you need to know. One shared bathroom in a claw foot tub.<br/>Clean as you go theme is helpful as you would in any hosts home.  Lots of books to read and  I bet it could be very relaxing  in the yard with fire place area and large backyard.  I was there for a working trip long hours away from the space."

They are very open minded and nice people, and gabe us a lot of tips for traveling Oregon and the West Coast. Thanks again for everything!

With each successive visit, I noticed their improvements to this craftsman home, evidence of their effort to provide a welcoming and comfortable respite for guests.  Over the past four years, I found it to be the best bargain in Salem for comfort, convenience and cost (always an important factor).  Whether visiting Willamette U or arriving by Amtrak, both are 10-15 minute walks.  Plenty of on-street parking.  And the best breakfast in Salem is nearby."

11362008,435868171,2019-04-11,56935171,Mary,Great value. Comfy bed.  Super nice folks. I will definitely stay again when I am in town!
11362008,436296516,2019-04-12,565936,Helen,This is a great place for those free spirits who are looking for an interesting place (home from 1925).  It was clean and in a good area.  The host were lovely though I was there only one night and exhausted from all of my traveling so I didn’t see much of them.  They were respectful when I was sleeping to be quiet even though it was early.  If you love the feel of a well-loved sweetly decorated old home you will love this place.
11362008,437500766,2019-04-14,27119863,Lara,"Clean, comfy, and super cute! It's a lovely craftsman house and Christy was very helpful and laid back. Would definitely recommend!"

EXCELLENT hosts, with a very relaxing backyard, an adorable dog, and lots of interesting local tips and information about Oregon. Christy went out of our way to help us  and has made our move to Salem so much easier.  I highly recommend staying here."
11362008,438858580,2019-04-17,2834780,Faith,"Christy & Arnaud's space is super cute, clean, and welcoming! I recommend their place as a simple and reliable place to spend the night. Great kitchen, sweet to see the chickens in the backyard out the window!"
11362008,446957098,2019-05-02,122782222,Darina,I had a very good stay. I was in town for work so it helped not having to drive back to work 2 hours everyday. Great little nook. I enjoyed the company
11362008,447476907,2019-05-03,94565859,Olivia,"Such a fun and relaxed stay! It was an excellent escape from several days of camping along the road. The space is a very comfortable set up, very clean and Christy and Arnaud are excellent hosts. Absolutely worth the price."
11362008,449507367,2019-05-06,69589226,Lindsey,Everything about the place and the hosts were wonderful!

Christy & Arnaud were great hosts; welcoming & friendly, and very willing to accommodate additional requests. Easy check-in, and great communication. Highly recommend a stay here."
11362008,452741156,2019-05-13,140161395,Zoie,Great stay
11362008,453399830,2019-05-15,219755384,Nick,"This is our second time staying with Christy and Arnond, they are wonderful hosts. Very friendly and welcoming but are also respectful and conscious of personal space. Their dog Otter is very sweet and friendly. Room and bathroom are always clean and the amenities are thoughtfully prepared for our stay"
11362008,454206439,2019-05-17,189756413,Henry,"Christy and Arnaud were incredibly friendly, welcoming, and helpful hosts. I particularly enjoyed talking to Christy and getting her travel suggestions for my road trip. Would love to stay here again!"

11362008,459778810,2019-05-27,173090810,Sherlaine,Christy and Arnaud’s place was so cute and clean! The house is also very close to everything so it was just  convenient for us to get food and other stuff! 10/10 would recommend!
11362008,460636977,2019-05-29,44337377,Noe,"Christy and Arnaud’s place is the place to go. In a quiet, peaceful neighbor. The rooms are kept up and having access to the kitchen was appreciated. They are good people with an amazing new pup, Otter. Otter alone is more than enough reason to visit this place. I am biased. I do really love playful dogs. Stay here! You won’t regret it."
11362008,461524942,2019-05-31,42248989,Margarita,Such a lovely home and even lovelier people.

11362008,473474990,2019-06-21,195878585,Kai,We stayed in a cute room at the back of the house. Christy and Arnaud were great hosts and it was a pleasure to stay with them. The space we stayed in was clean and we had a good time there.
11362008,477110814,2019-06-27,259065031,Michael,Easy transition and welcoming cosy stay! Not to far from public restaurants and highly recommended.

11362008,482668279,2019-07-06,148301244,Rachel,"This was my second stay, and it was great again! I was in and out quickly and really early in the morning, but they were so accommodating and welcoming to me and my dogs- would definitely recommend and would stay there again!"
11362008,483781618,2019-07-07,85029909,Haris,"Beautiful house, lots of space, nice looking backyards and many things to motivate you towards positivity"
11362008,484369385,2019-07-08,13819406,Brittany,"The place is great and the house is charming and old. Because of that, the house creaks and can be loud, but the atmosphere is nice."
11362008,484916461,2019-07-09,271578952,석희,"The house was near to Amtrak station, grocery store, park. It is enough cozy place if you find someplace to sleep. Hosts are kind, and I had a big chance to go to little show with hosts. Charge was reasonable. There is no reason to hesitate. Hurri up!"
11362008,486525833,2019-07-12,259603735,Stephen,These guys are so friendly and helpful.   I love the Labradoodle.  This is an awesome place to stay
11362008,489448673,2019-07-16,68752200,Annette,The room was very clean and comfortable and the perfect place to lay our head on our road trip through Oregon.  Excellent value and the resident puppy is adorable.
11362008,489961068,2019-07-17,4943013,Blake,"This home is a beautiful bungalow in central Salem.  It is clean as a whistle and furnished to match its style.  For the price, this is a really bargain."

11362008,494710719,2019-07-24,4669563,Mary,The room has great light and a comfy bed. It was quiet and I was able to work at the dining room table in the evening. Otter the dog is goofy and adorable!
11362008,495283410,2019-07-25,203967817,Kimberly,I had to study for a state test and my stay here was just what I needed. I made pressed coffee in their very clean and accomidating kitchen. Felt relaxed and at home and loved looking at all the cute  sayings and antiques they have around their amazing home. Slept very well and honestly didn't want to leave. This stay was good for my soul.. And I passed my test !!
11362008,505077027,2019-08-08,66048210,Hannah,"Wonderful time, and a sweet pup! Thank you!"
11362008,505701977,2019-08-09,283809930,Randy,A nice quiet house with a fun dog and lotsa chickens. Fresh eggs were available to fry up in the morning!
11362008,513552756,2019-08-19,27918661,Kaveh,Sparkling clean space. Comfy bed. Came late at night and left early morning with no issues. Perfectly happy!
11362008,514217378,2019-08-20,189657202,Amar,"We were the only guests that night so we had the whole place to ourselves. The house was lovely! It was very clean and the WiFi was fast. Christy and Arnaud were very nice when we communicated with them, although we did not see them during our stay (which brings me to the easy autonomous check-in process; a huge plus!). I would definitely stay here again."
11362008,515313638,2019-08-22,274088804,Karla,"My stay was great! Christy and Arnaud were super friendly and helpful. The information/directions to get to and into the home was very detailed and easy to follow.  Christy responded to very quickly to all questions and Arnaud was attentive to making sure we arrived and had everything we needed upon arrival. <br/>The room was adorable, comfortable, and clean with a back door that had access to the yard. <br/>I even left something behind and got a message right away to let me know. <br/>Thank you Christy and Arnaud!"
11362008,517737021,2019-08-25,188615457,Ariel,"As long as you remember that there's only one bathroom that you may be sharing with another guest, you're basically good to go. It's worth noting, however, I really only used their place to the extent of taking a shower and a 3 hour nap before I had to leave for the airport."
11362008,519037377,2019-08-27,66519006,Katy,"Just as advertised, clean home. Cute house with lots of character. Friendly people and dog!"
11362008,519480851,2019-08-28,402909,Donna,Great hosts. Nice old house with easy to understand instructions about staying there. Easy check in and they answered my inquiries promptly. Great value as well.
11362008,524812958,2019-09-06,186929949,Nicholas,Awesome space and very affordable!
11362008,527776647,2019-09-11,270589954,Tami,You will feel welcomed and comfortable!  A home away from home!
11362008,531119773,2019-09-16,213064576,Sam,Gorgeous clean and cozy home. They even left the light on for me. I wish I had stayed another night just to flip through some of the hundreds of books they have.
11362008,532402529,2019-09-19,259826875,Megan,"Great location, quiet neighbors, nice hosts. Just like staying in a friend's house rather than a hotel."
11362008,532973195,2019-09-20,10135714,Emily,"I only stayed one night, but it was nice. It’s a beautiful older home, in a good location."
11362008,534528192,2019-09-22,38878221,Roland,"Christy and Arnaud's place was just what I needed. A great price, close to where I needed to be and quiet. Thanks for opening up your home to me."
11362008,536904470,2019-09-27,2169896,Elizabeth,This cozy room and lovely hot shower were exactly what I needed after a long drive. They made it so easy for me to come in and feel like I could make myself at home. I enjoyed a cup of tea in the morning sunshine at the backyard picnic tables. Perfect way to start my day! So grateful!
11362008,538499312,2019-09-29,47028051,Duane,"So this is not a hotel, but Christy and Arnaud have filled the house with nice special conveniences.  Night lights in all the rooms for the late night dash to the shared bathroom, a little flashlight so you can find the light switch at 5:00 in the morning so you can make coffee.  An incredibly comfortable bed and pillows. They made clear that if I wanted privacy that was perfect but Arnaud and I spent 45 minutes hanging out and talking about travels and the Airbnb business.   Hospitality and consideration was great.  I was moving some stuff from Idaho to California and they gave me the driveway to park in so it would be safer than on-street parking.  Thanks, guys.  I'm not usually in Salem alone but if so, I'll come and visit you again."
11362008,539130411,2019-09-30,84920562,Alvin,"Only was here to sleep off my jet lag, but it was a cool spot. Wish I could have stayed longer!"
11362008,539624564,2019-10-01,30238898,Joseph (Michael),"Homey touches, good conversation"

11362008,542840781,2019-10-06,87233516,Erica,Very cozy and lovely space. I had a really peaceful and relaxing stay with access to a beautiful back yard.
11362008,543896688,2019-10-08,2938006,Theresa,This was my second time staying here and it's a good value overall. Check-in was straightforward and the room is basic but comfortable for my short stay.
11362008,544690625,2019-10-10,296794161,Kimberly,"This is an adorable, older bungalow with a ton of character. Check in was easy and clear. I stayed in the room in the back of the house and it was very quiet."
11362008,545143517,2019-10-11,31370738,Destine,Beautiful older house. Christy was prompt and sweet.
11362008,547226611,2019-10-14,9017462,Jessica,"Their home is so nice and instantly feels like home. I stopped for a work trip and was able to cook in their nice kitchen, use their very nice shower, and feel cozy before I was on my way. I would definitely recommend this stay!"
11362008,548482830,2019-10-17,9034794,Gina,Thanks so much for your warm hospitality and making things so easy. Very charming Craftsman home. Enjoy my wonderful stay!!

11362008,556102769,2019-10-28,72026581,Kyle,"Christy and Arnaud offer a wonderful space for guests to feel completely at home. A beautiful kitchen for cooking, clearly marked doors to the house's rooms and amenities, and their own personal warmth make this house a must for any person or couple in need of comfortable relaxation. It is close to downtown, but in a quiet neighborhood. The gracious hosts shared information and gave great advice about local attractions. Honestly, it felt more like staying with old friends than with an Air bnb!"
11362008,557299516,2019-10-31,29582659,Brandon,Was an enjoyable stay.  Good gig if your looking for something pet friendly.
11362008,559251831,2019-11-03,16595578,Rory,"This was my second time staying at Christy and Arnaud’s place and it was just as great as the first time. I enjoy how cozy it is and conveniently located to everything while still being a quiet neighborhood. Their communication is great and it is neat to see how lovingly they have been restoring their historic home. Just as I felt last time, I happily recommend others to stay here as well. I’m sure you’ll love it too."
11362008,559767123,2019-11-04,134016359,Albert,"Amazing house, quaint detailing with every little thing.  Good room for great value would highly recommend"
11362008,561175867,2019-11-08,302542494,Shannon,"What a lovely, warm and welcoming home. Christy and Arnaud's home more than lives up to the hype of everyone's positive reviews here. I will be happy to stay here again. Down to earth and kind people, plus a sweet and soft dog! What more could I ask for in an AirBNB?"
11362008,561556645,2019-11-09,213591914,Barbara,"Wonderful place to stay. Pleasant, clean, wonderful fragrances from the kitchen. Definitely recommend"

11362008,564011897,2019-11-14,302542494,Shannon,"My second stay was just as lovely as the first. I had mistakenly booked one night fewer than I needed, and Christy and Arnaud graciously worked with me to correct my mistake. They really make their guests feel welcome."
11362008,564396797,2019-11-15,38610897,Luke,Christy and Arnaud were great hosts! The place was very cozy and comfortable. They were great at communication and helping us check in / check out. Would definitely stay again.

11362008,573618403,2019-12-06,74528215,Fran,"great place, shared bathroom wasn't an issue at all"
11362008,574795439,2019-12-08,271320226,Samantha,"Wonderful stay! The room was a great place to drop for the night. House was quiet, even when my pup was being obnoxious (he was okay after I introduced him to the host and dogs). I am a private person and they let me be the entire evening. Excellent value in a convenient location with wonderful hosts. If I find myself in the area again, I wouldn't hesitate to stay again!"
11362008,575280119,2019-12-09,41765187,Karissa,"Great space, great communication, and courteous- I had an exam the next morning and they had guests over for dinner but were thoughtful to keep the volume down so I could get to sleep early. Slept well, and really felt this space was worth the value. Very nice and hospitable people!"
11362008,576186971,2019-12-12,313376911,Alec,Perfect place to stay when visiting Salem. Great hospitality and great people! Can't wait for my next stay.
11362008,577725732,2019-12-15,14718897,Kenneth,Expect everything to be as advertised. Quiet and calm household and chickens in the backyard. What's not to love?

11362008,585358841,2019-12-31,310591191,Lacy,You will not find another AirB&B with more gorgeous detail & character! As hosts they pull the home & travel experience together beautifully. I was astonished at all the hand crafted unique touches they had implemented to keep their guests comfortable & entertained. Beautifully done!
11362008,587218249,2020-01-02,321989858,Jonathan,Great place I enjoyed my stay
11362008,590140815,2020-01-07,87102941,Princeton,A wonderful place to stay! Highly recommended!
11362008,592384213,2020-01-12,177158601,Jonathan,I contacted Christy and Arnaud hoping to rent their space for multiple weeks.  They went out of their way to accommodate me as best they could and found me a more longterm rental with some of their friends.  Good people!!
11362008,594443996,2020-01-18,165913617,Derek,"I highly recommend this place! Whether you want to stay long term or short term, you will have a good time here. What I like most about Arnaud/Christy’s place is privacy, and I had plenty of that.  You can also have a good time talking with other guests in the house if you like conversations.   One recommendation I have is to put a lock on the door to the east-side bedroom.  Again, thanks for a wonderful stay!"
11362008,595175085,2020-01-19,144340787,Andrew,"Great value, was perfect for a hiking trip around the area"

11362008,603593518,2020-02-09,176682427,Meesh,"Christy and Arnaud have a charming home, and they are wonderful conversationalists! At least one of them is generally available if you have questions, and they gave us a lot of good tips about the area. They allowed us to stay for a few weeks with our dog, and when he met their dog they played like old friends. They share their house with multiple AirBnB guests, so if you would prefer to have a space to yourself you might not enjoy your stay."
11362008,604590473,2020-02-11,333067452,Naura,"Christy and Arnaud, When I got your place, I found home that called my memories about my childhood, beautiful energy inside the house. I believe you both putting a lot of love into it, so the spirit spread around your home! I thank you for your hospitality. The best of staying with you is finding friends! I heard Thursday is your birthday, so happy birthday Christy! I wish you all the best and happy for the rest of your life! <br/><br/>Many thanks,<br/>Naura"

Not only was the room and home comfortable and charmingly gorgeous, their hosting skills were totally on point.

The house itself is beautifully decorated, there are lots of options for shared spaces (no one else had booked the second room so we ended up having the whole place to ourselves), the bed was extremely comfy and we had access to a full kitchen and laundry facilities. We walked through town to the riverside the evening we arrived which took us about 25 minutes, and on the way were loads of great places to eat and beautiful buildings. The only thing I didn’t realise is that the dining area is where Christy and her husband also eat-if I had I definitely wouldn’t have left lots of baby stuff all over the place for Christy to enjoy with her breakfast…just a heads up for future guests!! Sorry guys! Christy also messaged straight away to let me know we’d left a plug behind. Would definitely recommend and would stay again if we ended up in Salem. Thanks for a great stay!"

11362008,725384346153823625,2022-09-27,83201088,Rene,This was a great place for us to lay our heads the middle of a 3 day road trip. The room was comfortable as was the mattress. The bathroom really is 2 maybe 3 steps away. We enjoyed a warm greeting with one of the doggies and our host. Location was great. We went to a local brewery that had great food and drink. Street parking was safe and easy.

The location is very convenient to the university and downtown.  The directions and checkin instructions were clear and correct.   I was the only guest (there are two separate bedrooms and a shared bathroom).  Christy's place is a fabulous value.  My only regret is that I didn't get to meet the dogs!

Easy parking, nice neighborhood, let ourselves in <br/>Bathroom is older and has claw foot tub with wraparound shower curtain, but we did not need to shower.

11362008,847934490437604751,2023-03-15,501128291,Ruozhang,我是第一次在airbnb订住处，比我想象中的样子要好太多了，因为我最开始先到机场然后不确定什么时候能到住处。房东也很热心的跟我沟通，入住也真的很方便，当我看到我房间的时候我真的很震惊。不光是有一个干净整洁的屋子，并且还给准备了浴巾以及毛巾。房东很热情，早上起床的时候还问我要不要一起吃早饭。入住感觉就真的感觉和自己家一样，如果有机会再来玩，我绝对会选择再次入住！
11362008,851583411320801218,2023-03-20,504499179,Benjamin,"I typically just keep to myself when i go anywhere, but it was a lovely stay. I saw the host a couple of times. It was positive. Both times. Also, they had 2 dogs, that were just a joy to be around."

12588161,76345751,2016-05-26,68677085,Jennie,Sharon was the perfect host. She made me feel welcome at all times and had thought of even the little things you often need when staying away from home. The room was lovely and furnished well. I couldn't have asked for somewhere better to stay. Otis the dog was so friendly too! 
12588161,78639949,2016-06-08,27720979,Grant,Sharon was lovely! Very friendly and was able to accommodate me on my later than planned arrival. I really liked her home and slept like a rock. Thanks Sharon!
12588161,81946201,2016-06-25,65903309,Michael,"I was there for 2 weeks of business.  Everything was exactly like the picture. Nice room quiet, and comfortable bed and rocker.  Sharon was a very good host.  Everything you needed was there and any questions asked were quickly answered.  She had told me her nephew was having a birthday there with family.  Asked if I wanted to join.  I did for a while, met and meet everyone.  Very nice family.  I excused myself as I was tired and need to get some rest for the next day's work.  Very quiet even during the birthday.  Impressed!  Thanks for a great stay."
12588161,83010567,2016-06-30,80109376,Tom,"Very pleasant stay in a lovely room. Sharon was welcoming but gave me space, and I would happily stay here again."

12588161,100407699,2016-09-09,32065714,Deborah,"The room and house are clean, well lit, and nicely decorated with plants and the space is overall cozy and cheerful.

12588161,147806879,2017-04-28,62931692,Eric,"Immaculate and caring host.  Quiet and clean.  Close to shopping, restaurants and downtown Salem.  TV, fridge, microwave and Keurig and access to WD made stay enjoyable and a lot better than a hotel.   "
12588161,185767694,2017-08-22,108159755,Ty,"What a great place to stay for the 2017 total solar eclipse (or anything else that might bring someone to Salem)!  Sharon's backyard is private and even were it not for the eclipse, it would've been a great place to just hang out and relax.  The home's location is very convenient to all sorts of restaurants and shopping.   <br/><br/>Inside, the bed and comforter were amazingly comfortable.  The bedroom is very private and the small refrigerator in the large walk-in closet was very useful.  The desk in the bedroom provided a nice work surface and the power strip was conveniently located on the desktop (no bending down below the desk to plug anything in).  The wi-fi worked flawlessly.  The bathroom was very clean and  functional, which to me, is one of the most important factors in any rental.  It is not an en suite bathroom so guests to Sharon's home will also use it but it sure seemed that her guests were very considerate and I could leave my toiletries out.  A Keurig coffee maker with a wide variety of coffee pods was a very welcoming touch.   <br/><br/>Of course, Otis made the stay even better!"
12588161,214890370,2017-11-26,93425251,Mary,"Perfect situation for me as a healthcare traveler.  Sharon was open, friendly, and willing to visit without making me fell obligated to do so.  Lovely clean home with lots of thoughtful touches in the closet and bathroom for guests."

12588161,232670525,2018-02-05,136145074,Marissa,"I stayed at Sharon's place for a month. It was was nicer than I expected and also very comfortable.  She literally had everything you would ever need either in the bedroom or bathroom.  The mini fridge in the closet actually fits more than it seems but beware, the freezer temperature doesn't seem to be even. Not all my stuff was frozen.  But if you don't need it and you're there for a short stay, the place is fantastic.  It was also cheaper than a lot of other places in Salem."
12588161,232896998,2018-02-07,53870257,Clyde,"Booking with Sharon was hassle-free, and she was very responsive with communication. I would definitely book again with her."

12588161,325786734,2018-09-20,124037494,Brenda,"Sharon’s place is in an ideal location. Five minutes drive to great stores & plenty of restaurants, coffee shops. Another 5-10 minutes takes you to downtown Salem. Her street is nice & quiet with ample parking. She has a nice garden to sit in & catch some rays.<br/> The bed is very comfortable & the shower is great.  Good work  space & a walk-in closet which serves as a tiny kitchen/dressing room. There is a microwave , refrigerator & a large cabinet yet still plenty of room to hang your clothes along with a good sized shelf for toiletries, etc.  <br/> Her cute dog Otis is a mighty little watch dog but sweet as can be. He just minds his own business.<br/>I recommend Sharon’s place, she is a fine host."

I felt like I was staying in a Paris boutique hotel. I really appreciated the many thoughtful extras like fluffy towels, comfortable bed and pillows, keurig coffee setup and walk in closet with mini fridge. The location is super convenient and just a short walk or drive to grocery stores and many restaurants. I will definitely stay here again."

The guest room is quiet and comfortable with a small fridge, microwave, cups, plates, bowls, cutlery, and a Keurig coffee machine (with a great assortment of coffees).<br/>Sharon communicated quickly with me and was very accommodating. Sharon is a friendly and unintrusive host. I would stay here again."
12588161,416653664,2019-02-24,146989516,Alina,"Sharon has been an absolutely amazing host! Communication and check-in were prompt and easy. The home was extremely nice, clean, and the location is perfect. My room was completely cozy with all the best amenities— smart tv, coffee maker, mini fridge, large closet, and the list goes on. This has been a great experience during my extended business trip and truly has been home away from home!"

The room and bed was very comfortable and included many extras, like a coffee maker with a great selection of coffees, a microwave, refrigerator, and dishes and utensils. Everything was squeaky clean, too! Highly recommend."
12588161,515988465,2019-08-23,206955340,Marian,Cozy and quiet and very clean space. Close to downtown and campus.
12588161,520561653,2019-08-30,62677069,Katherine,I was taking some classes at Willamette University and was so grateful that Sharon’s place is open. She was willing to loan me a bike and I was able to coast the 1.7 miles into class with no hills and no worries. Saved me paying for parking and just the stress of commuting in general. Internet was great and aally needs were met. She was super flexible and And will totally try to stay there for future classes.
12588161,576892321,2019-12-14,264875933,Omar,Nice and clean place
12588161,584234427,2019-12-29,64247451,Miranda,"I’d give 10 stars if they let me! I travel A LOT, and Sharon’s place is one of my top favs now! Such a welcoming hostess and Ottis is fluffy awesome<br/><br/>A gorgeous home, sparklingly clean, and lovely decor greets you. All of the thoughtful touches in the room made me feel like I was staying in my own hotel room, just better! Super convenient location to top it off. I will happily book this stay again for my next OR trip"
12588161,598687447,2020-01-27,317238155,Catherine,"Can't go wrong with this airbnb! Quiet, easy going, and convenient. I would definitely stay again."
12588161,631701320,2020-06-23,173828247,Colby,Amazing host! Very clean home. All the amenities you can imagine. Would recommend to anyone.
12588161,633173633,2020-06-28,47422260,David,"Sharon has a nice comfortable home and communications with her was very good. I love the selections of coffee she had available. I recommend staying at Sharon’s, she is a great host!"

12588161,670560051,2020-10-03,366944412,Sarah,Comfortable room with everything you could possibly need! Sharon was great!
12588161,700475568,2020-10-14,371169348,Hatem,This house is very clean and Sharon is an excellent host
12588161,703352733,2020-10-24,61579701,Veronica,Easy Check. Very clean and comfy. I appreciated the coffee bar!
12588161,705918508,2020-11-01,204601058,Alex,Sharon's home is very cute and well kept. I would stay there again!
12588161,713554011,2020-12-05,374865810,Glenn,Sharon’s place is safer and cleaner than the extended stays that I looked at.
12588161,746437446,2021-04-06,391054137,Lowell,It was a great stay. I would stay there again.
12588161,769052005,2021-06-11,285839406,Tram,"Great host! Very clean and accommodating stay, just as described. Would recommend to others and stay again."
12588161,434108880345022228,2021-08-21,266402926,Tanya,"Sharon has a lovely home in a safe area that is nearby many shops and parks. I stayed with Sharon for an extended period of time (2 months) and she was always hospitable and helpful. (Ottis her dog greeted me often and it always made my day). If you are looking for a place that is clean, safe, and for an amazing value I recommend Sharon's place for just that."
12588161,463030929089393034,2021-09-30,410152119,Eliana,"I stayed here for a month and had a great experience. The room is cozy and comfortable, and having access to the microwave, mini fridge, and coffee bar was great. As someone without a car, I was still able to get around Salem because bus stops are a close walk away, around 10-12 mins depending on the line. Shops on Commercial St are also close by. Keep in mind that it is a small house, and there's no private entrance, so you will be living in pretty close quarters with the host - it's like having a roommate. But this was never an issue since Sharon was always very friendly, accommodating, and helpful. She was kind enough to let me extend my stay for an extra night on short notice. Ottis is also very cute. Especially for such a good price, this is a great stay in a convenient location, and I'd definitely recommend it for both short & long trips!"
12588161,487681537833017841,2021-11-03,350006593,Ariel,"This place is located in a safe neighborhood. Great value, clean, and host was friendly."
12588161,586961807859744327,2022-03-20,317238155,Catherine,"Sharon was very helpful getting me acclimated to the area. Nice, quiet, and peaceful home and neighborhood."
12588161,596382903481743633,2022-04-02,446720888,Santario,Omg when I say this place was amazing it is an understatement. Everything you need she has. A very welcoming environment. The dog Ottis is the cutest and will become your bestie! The house is sooooo quiet and cleannnnnn!!!! If you are thinking about booking do it immediately because it will be gone and the room is much bigger in person!
12588161,602222983702253405,2022-04-10,264126815,Jon,"Sharon has a beautiful home, and she is so welcoming!! I love this place"
12588161,609481646839500509,2022-04-20,264126815,Jon,Sharon was a great host!!
12588161,660941915009095694,2022-06-30,408210942,Ressa,The most amazing experience! So clean and comfortable. Sharon was the best host you can ask for. Gave me amazing suggestions for things around town and made the transition from moving to California to Oregon that much easier. I stayed for 2 months and I would highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone who needed to stay in Salem Oregon.
12588161,683458750280892169,2022-07-31,379308472,Marnie,"Great stay in south Salem; I was here for a month while on a work contract at the hospital. It took me less than 10 minutes each day to get to work. Sharon’s home is clean and cozy, with many live plants giving it a peaceful vibe. The room itself has a mini fridge, Keurig, microwave and dishes. Everything that you need. Lots of streaming channel options. You have the hall bath to yourself. Otis is a great watchdog but sweet, and will spend time with you if you want him to. There is street parking either in front of the home or across the street within the cul de sac. It’s a quiet area. I enjoyed my stay here and would recommend."
12588161,689930605596015590,2022-08-09,246875716,Kelly,Great location.  Everything went smoothly.  Room and everything was great.
12588161,702265391719279646,2022-08-26,132004240,Hansen,"Had an excellent stay, host was helfpul and more then welcoming during my time there. Good spot for short or long term trips!"
12588161,721760760503190435,2022-09-22,280742596,Sidney,Sharon makes you feel at home best stay I ever had great room very clean great location hope to stay their again thanks Sharon !
12588161,729062839568601625,2022-10-02,260046840,James,beautiful home. I felt welcomed and not out of place.
12588161,768904679192355004,2022-11-26,155809930,Monaisa,Sharon’s place was awesome comfortable and quiet felt right at home
12588161,786317480841626008,2022-12-20,466929905,Mark,Had everything you might need.
12588161,811703309528795627,2023-01-24,155809930,Monaisa,Second stay with Sharon it was great quiet and felt right at home.
12588161,816081174180694467,2023-01-30,496999097,Niko,"Very good host. Communicates well, respects your space"
12892550,74353360,2016-05-15,292546,Adam,"I came in late, and it was easy to check in and find my room. The house and room were clean and comfortable. It's a quiet neighborhood, about a 20 minute walk downtown if that's your thing. I would absolutely stay with Nick again!"
12892550,74617775,2016-05-16,72006496,James,Easy to communicate with and very accommodating. Well worth the price of rental. 
12892550,76543501,2016-05-28,73396741,Julie,"This place was extremely clean and comfortable, and convenient to the downtown area and the highway. Cute, quiet neighborhood. The owner was available to me by phone. The wi-fi did not work, which was a bummer, though the owner offered to drive down from Portland to try to fix it (which I said wasn't necessary). I used the kitchen freely and left it as I found it. There were four rooms being occupied upstairs, and the walls between rooms were very quite thin. This wasn't a problem for me, because I sleep well regardless, but I could hear the voices of others quite clearly, and this might bother other people. A great price for a simple, no-frills, comfortable, safe stay."
12892550,77026436,2016-05-30,71880027,Jessica,"This place was great! It was easy to get the keys to the house and the room I stayed in had a lock on the door for extra security. The neighborhood was mature, felt really safe and parking was readily available. The bed was super comfy and made for a good nights rest. The other areas of the home were updated and welcoming. Everything was so peaceful that I found myself sleeping in, which I never do. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
12892550,77598140,2016-06-02,7801884,Brigitte Biggie,"Nick is super awesome and flexible! We got the room about 4 hours before we were checking in. He also gave us some suggestions of places to visit nearby. The room is clean and tidy, the shared bathroom is nice and has everything I needed."
12892550,78999036,2016-06-10,75633552,Praveen,"Nick is a wonderful person, Was very co operative when i mentioned about some concerns and he took care of those issues pretty fast.  Very good home with all the amenities."
12892550,79587774,2016-06-13,76668980,Kay,"We did enjoy our short stay here.  It was our first experience with airbnb.  It will be fun to pass on info to our kids, and keep in mind when we have guests who need lodging in the Salem area.  Thanks, Nick, for making us feeling welcome.  It was good to talk with you by phone. :)   <br/><br/>PS  We came late both nights and left early, so no time to enjoy downstairs which looked pleasant and comfy. :)  The beds were comfortable.<br/>"
12892550,80979120,2016-06-20,74185509,Derek,"Living at Nick's is similar to how I would live at home:  clean, comfortable, and convenient.  He is easy to communicate with and respond in a timely manner.  The neighborhood is friendly which is minutes away from the Landcaster Mall and downtown Salem!  Sure I would recommend staying at Nick's when visiting Salem. "
12892550,91499259,2016-08-05,74185509,Derek,Nick's house was enjoyable to stay at that I decided to extend my stay.  Easy to communicate with!  
12892550,92227585,2016-08-08,16581757,Gary And Debra,"The house is located in a residential neighborhood of northeast Salem, only a few miles from the State Capitol.  The room I rented was clean and airy, and the bed was comfortable, but overall it was pretty sparsely furnished.  The photo in the listing doesn't look like the room I stayed in.  Also, I didn't see any evidence of air conditioning, as stated in the listing. The bathroom across the hall was very large and nicely updated.  There is a shared living room and dining room, which no one seems to use, and a nice, fully-equipped kitchen.  There are 3 separate Airbnb rooms in the house, but I wasn't sure if they were occupied during my stay.  Nick doesn't live in the house, so we didn't meet in person, but he was very responsive by email and answered all my questions quickly.  Overall, this room provides basic accommodations in a good location at a good price."
12892550,100601865,2016-09-10,90868929,Brian,I never had the opportunity to meet Nick. We talked by phone on my arrival and he basically walked the house over the phone. Enjoyed my short stay. The breakfast recommendation Nick left on the desk was definitely a winner
12892550,100703289,2016-09-10,94224058,Brandon,"Excellent place, great value. Enjoyed it and would certainly stay here again."
12892550,101308472,2016-09-12,94067531,Leticia,"This was my first experience with AirBnB. My sister and I stayed at Nick's place for 2 nights. Nick's response was fast despite our last minute booking! Instructions were very clear and we really liked the ""treating it as a hotel"" vibe. All the essentials were provided which was really nice! I also liked the space and freedom of the house (even though we weren't there during the day to enjoy it). We were able to arrive late and also cook our own eggs in the morning! :) Very comfy bed and I especially liked that I had a work space to do some homework, studying, and get work done. The only thing I was a little self conscious about was the cracking noise on the wood floor when I would walk around my room late at night and to the bathroom. We hope we weren't too loud for our neighbors. Would definitely recommend Nick's place for anyone looking for a nice, clean, private, and quiet place! :-) "
12892550,103652383,2016-09-23,1343066,Moses,Stayed at Nick's beautiful home. Everything was as described in this quiet neighbourhood and he was very clear with instructions on where everything is as well. I will stay here again soon. Thanks
12892550,105185073,2016-09-30,25011371,Jason,"Great spot to crash for a few days. Quiet neighborhood, good location, spacious and comfortable room. There were a few other people staying there at the same time, which occasionally got a little hectic, but we enjoyed our time here overall."
12892550,107686976,2016-10-11,12481126,Gene,"This is an AirBnB income property and the home owner does not live here.  It is a very nice home but I prefer staying at people's homes with them....""home away from home"" feel like a important to me.  I am not familiar with how to distinguish whether or not a house is an income property or the actual owners live there....I'll investigate this more on my end."
12892550,108133509,2016-10-14,21704821,Ditte And Steve,"I will not recommend this place. The listing did not clearly state that there are multiple rooms (4?) being rented out. When we were there, all the rooms were occupied (not all through AirBnb, according to the labels on the doors). We could hear the floors creak, the doors open and close, people talking, and TV.<br/>This places allows instant booking but when we arrived, the room wasn't clean from the previous renter. Nick told me where to find the sheets and towels, but the linen closet was empty. He told me to look in the dryer. The dryer was packed with sheets and towels, still wet, and already smelly from having sat there for a while. I emptied the dryer then dried 1 sheet so we could sleep. If we hadn't been so tired, we would have moved to a hotel."
12892550,108620080,2016-10-16,17721132,Tomás,"Nice clean room - in a nice clean house. Close to Willamette University. We had a fun time visiting our daughter on Family Weekend at the university.<br/><br/>If you want to have a clean convenient room in a nice well kept house you can't go wrong."
12892550,109153472,2016-10-19,46253682,Rick,Great guidance on how to find and get in to the place.  Being on business travel I especially appreciated knowing a late arrival was not a concern right away.  A great central location.  Take him up on the restaurant he suggests for breakfast - they were great.  (though now I've forgotten their name).  I will certainly be back.
12892550,109457381,2016-10-21,36572113,Michelle,"I was in town for a conference, and so I was at the house very little. I just needed a clean, comfortable place to sleep, wash up, and eat a meal. This host provided all of those things. Very comfortable bed!"
12892550,110500800,2016-10-26,44289987,Allie,The house is shared with two other airbnb rooms so it runs a little bit like a hotel. I really appreciated that I had my own room key and the bathroom had a a privacy lock. Everything was clean and well-kept and I had everything I needed. This was the perfect no-nonsense place for business travelers such as myself. I hope to stay here again soon. 
12892550,112043575,2016-11-03,76303109,Ingeborg,Large room with great workspace and plenty of power outlets.
12892550,113024846,2016-11-09,36164027,Jacky,This was my second time staying at Nick's Airbnb and it was just as great as the first time! The house was clean and the amenities were perfect for a business traveler like myself. I love how he has washer and dryers for his guests to use; a major perk for travelers who travel often. I've already stayed twice and would noy hestitate to stay at Nick's airbnb in the future!
12892550,113792175,2016-11-13,103033289,Tj,"Nice house to stay, lots of conveniences available and makes it very easy to carry on as you would in your own home."
12892550,114327372,2016-11-17,62488411,Devin,It worked out well. 
12892550,116450699,2016-11-30,104537665,Denny,"It's quaint and delightful!  ""Experience a bit of older Salem in an updated, uniquely classy, fashion."""
12892550,122733942,2016-12-25,63401663,Estela,The place is more beautiful than the pictures. Very spacious and warm. Host was very nice and made sure i had what i needed.
12892550,127057366,2017-01-15,3053884,Jane,Very convenient for business travel. The bed is really comfortable.
12892550,127599854,2017-01-19,3529894,Kris,Nick's place was quaint and clean. It was great for me. I was there for business and was looking for a nice place to sleep and work a bit. Check in and check out were super smooth. I stayed for 3 days. I heard another person once or twice but I didn't annually see anyone. 
12892550,128956820,2017-01-28,36164027,Jacky,"Consistency - that is what you get with Nick's house. This is my third stay at Nick's and it is consistently great for the value. For the value, it's hard not to stay here. I will definitely return and will recommend others too!"
12892550,129824515,2017-02-02,56518,Greg & Xintong,"Very clean, comfortable room and house is convenient location to central Salem.  Hosts kept me well informed about check-in and access to home."
12892550,132075784,2017-02-15,20755548,David,"Beautiful house, very clean, nice and quiet neighborhood. Walking distance to a nice park, 5-10 minute drive to downtown Salem and I-5. Great place."
12892550,132926386,2017-02-19,102013679,Terry,Great place to stay! Very nice home with lots of room.
12892550,133959955,2017-02-25,74235905,Barry,This house is a neat classic. Very clean and quiet. The bedroom we stayed in was very roomy and clean. Shared bathroom but we didn't see the other guest. Will book again!
12892550,135877518,2017-03-06,102013679,Terry,Very nicely updated older home close to downtown
12892550,136277749,2017-03-09,18832753,Marjorie,"This is a good value and the house is in a very nice neighborhood. At the same time, it was like staying in a do-it-yourself boarding house, since the hosts don't live there. If you are hoping to meet your hosts or be in a place that feels like a home, this one isn't for you. If you are a do-it-yourself type, Nick's place has large rooms with comfortable beds (at least, mine was), large clean kitchen and clean bathroom."
12892550,136606457,2017-03-11,6456920,Mary,Great Value.  Very quiet.
12892550,137316455,2017-03-14,18607360,Meridith,Very clean and nice!
12892550,138375424,2017-03-19,117988840,Carlo,House very clean and quiet. Booking process streamlined and easy. Nick made it easy for us to book at the last moment!<br/>Comfortable room 
12892550,138815259,2017-03-21,49097256,Kari,We enjoyed staying at this house. It is in a very nice quiet neighborhood! The location is great when one has business at the capitol. We would like to stay there again another time.
12892550,138979860,2017-03-22,61161134,Angela,Nick's place is very comfortable and clean. Nice neighborhood. I recommend staying there.
12892550,139119706,2017-03-23,9565393,John,Easy and comfortable
12892550,140236780,2017-03-28,1783635,Desey,Nice quiet stay.
12892550,147998935,2017-04-29,102013679,Terry,Have stayed at Nick's place several times and would recommend it to anyone.
12892550,149532911,2017-05-04,119141200,Benjamin,"This is a great place to stay for anyone whether you're visiting Willamette University, taking a family vacation, or you're just looking to relax. The home was very quiet, quaint, and clean. The owners were very polite and professional. I would recommend this place highly to anybody and would definitely stay here again. "
12892550,149982363,2017-05-06,3169138,Jean,"The place is clean but there are several year-round renters, and none of them were asked to represent the host, whom I never met. So hospitality was lacking - no instructions even for making coffee."
12892550,151437451,2017-05-12,835914,Lois,"Super quiet, lovely neighborhood, spotlessly clean.  I didn't meet anyone in person, but it was exactly what I needed for a conference.  I took Amtrak from Portland to Salem and there were plenty of local buses near the house to get around while I was there. "
12892550,152319321,2017-05-15,118563981,Caroline,"Overall, after the initial issues with the check-in information and wifi, we had a nice stay at this location. It was very clean and comfortable and mostly quiet. The hosts were fairly easy to contact and were responsive to problems. I would encourage others to stay here, but would highly recommend contacting the hosts ahead of time just to double check that all information provided is correct and up-to-date."
12892550,154479371,2017-05-24,31416038,Matthew,The house is very nice and clean and is the perfect location. Check in / Out was very simple and the host was reachable and communicated quickly with me. Wish my stay was longer - definitely would suggest this home if you are staying in the area or just want a jump off point for Oregon travels. 
12892550,154702488,2017-05-25,100121606,Abby,Loved it!!!
12892550,156209608,2017-05-29,73253672,Michael,Peaceful home in a beautiful and historic tree lined neighborhood of Salem. Great rooms with well equipped and up-to-date accommodations. This is a wonderful house with very clean and nice sized rooms when looking for a quiet stay. Great location with easy access to Salem and the surrounding areas. Plenty of on street parking and easily accessible. This location is highly recommended and includes all the friendly conveniences required for a very comfortable stay.
12892550,159858448,2017-06-11,106768421,Mengyao,Convenient location for a quick trip to Salem!
12892550,161899263,2017-06-18,19046260,Mary,"This was my second stay in this lovely historic home. Very convenient check-in process. It's a big house with multiple rooms for rent and I could hear one of my neighbors watching a movie kind of late, but nothing some ear plugs couldn't fix. "
12892550,162875918,2017-06-22,1472057,Alyssa,"I had a quick stay in Nick's place but it was more than adequate. The bed was very comfy for my tastes. It had a big desk that I could do some last minute work on. It also had a printer (I didn't look to see if it had paper) that was available. The WIFI internet worked great. Being that it is an old remodeled house, it looks to have the original wood floors which definitely are noisy when any of the house guests walk around, but it was quiet otherwise. I would stay here again. Thanks Nick and Julia."
12892550,164318218,2017-06-27,42098278,Richard,"Great place! Clean, quite, and comfy "
12892550,165094565,2017-06-30,607628,Jen,"Staying at this peaceful, spacious & perfectly located historic home in Salem was very enjoyable. <br/>Nick & Julia promptly handled all communication with great kindness, and check-in was easy.  <br/>The house has everything you need, beautiful living & dining rooms, a fully equipped kitchen, huge bathroom, very comfortable beds, and even a wonderful porch swing. There's the added pleasure of occasional other friendly guests to chat with, as well. I highly recommend a stay here.  "
12892550,166870783,2017-07-04,39761869,Michelle,As other reviews noted there several rented rooms. The bathroom is shared with all renters. Everyone stayed in there room with the door shut and we didn't know who else was there. The house was large and in a quiet neighborhood walking distance to some downtown places. We only had 1 towel for 2 of us for 2 days. For the extra person fee and cleaning fee I expected plenty of towels and a spic and span home. 
12892550,170103342,2017-07-14,22585584,Lynette,There were some cleanliness issues (dirty dishes in cabinets- old food in bedroom mini-fridge).  Host sometimes difficult to get in touch with.  But nice house in convenient area.
12892550,174100217,2017-07-24,8899621,Thomas,Comfortable bed. Good temperature when room AC run.
12892550,178547580,2017-08-05,617641,Mj,Nice place 
12892550,180232204,2017-08-09,10190140,Harley,"This was a terrible experience.  We texted early in the day with our ETA, but got no response.  After we arrived, there was no host, no direction or instructions, and a lock box on the front door with no code.  We spent 45 minutes on the porch in the hot sun, exhausted from a 10-hour drive and no way to get in.  Finally, after many tries, we found a code in the AirBnB pages, but it did not work.  We called and texted the hosts numerous times with no reply.  Finally, we called AirBnB, who kindly put us up in a hotel, but it was some time before even that was sorted out.  (A shout-out to Jonathan at AirBnB for excellent service and follow-up, though.  Thanks!)  Only after we were in the hotel did we get a response from the hosts, which was far too little, too late.  This was my first ever bad experience on AirBnB.  I would not risk booking with these hosts again."
12892550,185100705,2017-08-20,74605911,Oliver,"Tolle Unterkunft, großes Zimmer, nah am Stadtzentrum und ruhig gelegen.<br/>Habe hier eine tolle Zeit gehabt."
12892550,190973798,2017-09-05,15967960,Sybille,"Overall a great experience! Spacious, nice house, with a big kitchen. Close to the fairgrounds, where I was working. Quiet neighborhood. I enjoyed my time there and would recommend this place."
12892550,192677063,2017-09-10,145543862,Meg,The room was very clean. I didn't see one single person while staying here! So it was really quiet. Bathroom was clean. Had everything I needed. Definately reccomend!
12892550,201702150,2017-10-08,96094273,Gloria,My husband and I appreciated the value and location of Nick and Julia's home -- close to campus and walkable to downtown. The living space was clean and comfortable (once we got past the initial snafu of an incorrect lockbox code and could get into our room). We would definitely consider returning here.
12892550,202328004,2017-10-10,147980489,Tonnie,Beautiful quiet house. Very clean. Nick answered questions quickly. I would stay there again.
12892550,207691590,2017-10-29,6889516,Matthew,"Easy check in. Nice big, well furnished, common area inside and large fenced area. Quiet house while I was there - felt like I had the place to myself."
12892550,209732018,2017-11-05,24125502,Alyssa,Nice house with welcoming host. Thanks for a great stay!
12892550,211419228,2017-11-12,157719561,Erik,"First Airbnb exp and it won’t be the last. The house had everything I️ needed,bed was comfy and WiFi was fast. Great experience thank you."
12892550,223820466,2018-01-01,26498121,Nicole,"Julia & Nick were available, helpful, generous and kind! The house is spacious and nice and clean! Great value. Really glad I found them so last minute on New Year’s Eve!"
12892550,226108051,2018-01-08,17851518,Sara,"The house has been recently remodeled and is kept clean. The common living areas are very spacious but rarely used. The two people who live here full time stay in their rooms, more like a hotel or boarding house. In fact, I didn't meet anyone until I was leaving (the system is set up so that you can get and return your own keys and are not reliant on an in-person host). It's only 1.5 miles from Salem Hospital so the location was ideal for me, and it's bike-able."
12892550,231359958,2018-01-31,8337549,Will,"Quick, enjoyable stay. Highly recommended!"
12892550,237377715,2018-02-22,9412171,David,The best thing about this place is the huge downstairs living room and kitchen. This space is shared but it is expansive.
12892550,243645922,2018-03-16,14088238,Britta,Great stay for a quick work trip to Salem! The room was big and clean and quiet! The surrounding neighborhood is safe and I felt secured.  Nick and Julia were more than accommodating as my work schedule changed multiple times and so I had to alter my reservation multiple times. The other residents were very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be staying again on my next trip to Salem!
12892550,247197542,2018-03-27,28985508,Tatianna,"Beautiful old house! Very easy to check in and the permanent residents were helpful when we saw them. Had a few minor glitches that Julia cleared up quickly. The single bathroom got pretty busy at times but not a surprise. Much like a boarding house/hostel set up which I think is perfect for young travellers or passing through. I missed meeting up with a host and learning about the area, but that is just my preference."
12892550,249744240,2018-04-02,181684746,William,The regular or permanent residents who are not hosting can be an issue. The property is fine if you can share space.
12892550,256391966,2018-04-22,174277500,Christopher,"This experience was upsetting. This listing is a bit misleading. It is NOT a private room with a private bathroom as I was made to believe, but more along the lines of dorm living sharing a bathroom with 4 other rooms. This wouldn’t have been too bad had the toilet not look like it hadn’t been cleaned in weeks! Covered in pubic hair and urine. This wasn’t the only thing unclean. Dust and cobwebs covered the halls, bathroom, and our room. When we arrived, we could not get in with the codes on AirBNB. The hosts did not send us check in information and the codes they have on AirBNB do not match. This, of course, is after I was in communication with the host all day about a check in time. It was more important that I come after 5 than receive the code and key to my room. When we got into the room, one of the two beds was not made and there were NO extra pillows for the second bed, even in the spare closet they told us we’d find them. <br/><br/>In summary: misleading listing description, Incomplete communication, and unclean and unmade room. <br/><br/>We will not be returning."
12892550,257584722,2018-04-26,144711218,Lee,Solid value.
12892550,261057596,2018-05-05,21822808,Jesse,"Nice, clean and simple. Recommended for anyone who needs an easy stay in Salem."
12892550,264758120,2018-05-14,183242127,Rena,"It's a nice old house and a comfortable place to stay.  There is only one bathroom for 4 rooms, but it worked out."
12892550,269725055,2018-05-27,167962260,Sarah Kae,"Very well located tidy, and well thought out home. The kitchen and dining area combo is delightful. We really appreciated having our meals there and visiting with a few friends, cozy!"
12892550,271942575,2018-06-02,21507183,Breeanna,The place was nice and comfortable. Two thumbs up!
12892550,278762527,2018-06-18,192149288,Jonathan,"Wonderful. Quiet. Peaceful, as advertised.  Good price. Easy and simple. Just great."
12892550,279802299,2018-06-21,100341668,Chris,"Great place that has self check in, which I really like. I've stayed there before and had a great experience."
12892550,291436561,2018-07-15,196672702,Brett,"Convenient, quiet, spacious place with lots of extras. Bed is super comfy."
12892550,292342821,2018-07-17,11281997,Pete,"The place was reasonably clean for my tastes. Check was simple, nice quiet neighborhood. There were parts of the bedroom that were a bit dusty. I am not a clean freak so the dust did not bother me except when I had to climb under the desk to plug in the AC unit. To get the AC unit to plug in just right was quite the ordeal. Once I finally figured it out I slept well. "
12892550,295095342,2018-07-22,102433836,Whitney,"Older house in a great location in Salem, OR. Don't be fooled by the outside of the house, inside the house is nice. Not too far from anything I went to, walkable to some things, and easy to get to/from house. The self check-in/check-out was handy since I arrived really late and had to leave really early. Julia was very quick to respond to my inquiries, so even though she wasn't there if you need anything, just let her know. For a solo traveler, it's like a hostel house so I just used it as a room for sleeping/showering when I wasn't out and about. The house has large rooms and large common areas, so there's great potential for good times if you can book as a group."
12892550,297801963,2018-07-28,166194783,Sayarah,"My grandma and I booked this place last minute and we were very excited about someone actually being able to host us on the same day. As soon as I requested the booking, it was accepted and paid in full. I sent them a friendly message for the last minute-ness about it and went on our way. At check in time we arrived to the house and rang to doorbell and stood outside for 5 minutes waiting for someone to answer. I then read that I was supposed to get a message about a key box and how to open it, which I did not. I though, “no big deal I’ll just have to call them and ask for it over the phone”. I called both of the numbers provided on their page and not only did they not answer a single call, each call went straight to voicemail. I was kind of annoyed as this point but I was giving them the benefit of the doubt and gave them time to call or message back. After two hours I still had not heard anything back from them and was getting really anxious about if I was going to have a place to stay that night. I tried calling again, straight to voicemail. At this point and I’m beyond livid and call Airbnb themselves and demanded a full refund. They told me they had to give the hosts 45 minutes to respond to Airbnb before they could refund me. Shockingly enough, they didn’t respond!! I was able to get a full refund because of Airbnb’s great customer service. Don’t ever stay here. The hosts are unreliable, unprofessional and clearly don’t give a damn about having a reputable business. I bet they won’t even respond to this review "
12892550,306593513,2018-08-12,7318639,Ida,Centrally locates in Salem. Very responsive hosts! 
12892550,310666287,2018-08-19,167313686,Shelby,Great place for a short stay. Very close to downtown Salem and a very well kept house. Host was accommodating and gave good food suggestions. Would stay here again! 
12892550,312578204,2018-08-23,97575226,Amy,"This is a lovely renovated house. The hosts were clear communicators. The place was immaculately clean and the items for guest use were clearly marked: utensils, cookware, Kuerig and coffee pods, dishes and flatware, extra towels in the bathroom. There is a comfortable living room, dining room, laundry and kitchen with nice appliances for guest use The house is in a quiet residential neighborhood. The hosts say this in the description but really pay attention to the part about shared bathrooms. There is one half bath and one full bath for 5 rooms.  I would stay here again.  "
12892550,318887684,2018-09-04,17622764,Jeff,Nice house could use another bathroom
12892550,324315298,2018-09-16,167676576,Reene ♡,"100% super great, bed was very comfortable, great location, nice quiet neighborhood with pretty trees, definitely would love to stay again!"
12892550,324746465,2018-09-17,121348283,Lawrence,"Overall a good stay; however, if sharing a bath room is a problem, this isn’t the place for you. I just needed a place to rest my head, so perfect for me. The overall all feel is that of a rooming house, but very clean. Big shared space and good kitchen from the looks. Great location in an a tree lined neighborhood. Let your requirements guide you in choosing this place."
12892550,347094608,2018-11-10,223567009,Mrisho,The place is good the hosts are very helpful
12892550,364967729,2018-12-31,224685080,Jonathan,"Great location, wonderful amenities, beautiful home. An awesome place to stay for a weekend or a month!"
12892550,401199424,2019-01-13,3867066,Leeann,Beautiful and Charming home. The other guests were very friendly. Nice to have a washer and dryer. Very quiet and peaceful.
12892550,407323722,2019-02-01,92659973,Shikha,The best was their helfpul tenant.

12892550,455425205,2019-05-19,57824072,Barbara Lynn,"This was a lovely place to stay, but I was on a quick visit and didn't get to enjoy it much. Comfortable bed and a shared bathroom upstairs."
12892550,458975155,2019-05-26,185209314,John,Great spot! I went down to Salem for a concert and needed a place to stay for the night. Planned on this spot about a month in advance and it is as good as advertised. Great for my purposes!
12892550,488276072,2019-07-14,7872700,Stephane,"I would give this experience a negative star if possible.<br/><br/>I think this was perhaps my tenth AirBnB?!<br/><br/>My second in Oregon, and my only attempt in Salem. <br/><br/>It was the worst AirBnB yet!<br/><br/>I have had issues with some hosts in the past who falsely represented their space, and this is the first time a host has refused to refund me.<br/><br/>Lessons learned: <br/><br/>1) never book a last minute stay on a Friday night after you have been on the road 12 hours a day for days.  You are bound to make mistakes. <br/><br/>2) Be sure and select the drop down menu to include your traveling companion, even if in your initial email you mention said companion because host might be unscrupulous and use your mistake to justify keeping your money even if you do not stay in the room.  <br/><br/>3)  If host is using an inferior lock box, walk away!  <br/><br/>4) If host hides behind email, and does not reach out to you directly when you are having issues getting in, walk away!<br/><br/>5) No matter how exhausted you are, and even though you have to make the bed, take the time to search the closets in the hall to find the linens you need, because even though   It smells of cigarette smoke and your companion is allergic, your host expects you to stay, or will keep your money.<br/><br/>Know that professionally cleaned here does not include making the bed, and that even though the room was not ready to let, said host made it available anyway because... well they need the money.<br/><br/>I suspect Julia and Nick are having difficulty in general as in the fews days since I tried to stay here they have rebranded their AirBnB account, from Julia to Nick and changed the photo to exploit a young child (Never a good idea), though rebranding is probably a good thing as it was not doing anything positive for the AirBnB brand as it was.<br/><br/>I’m still hopeful that AirBnB will see fit to reimburse me for this mistake, and that Julia and Nick will find the resources elsewhere to fix the gaping hole in the porch beneath the lockbox. <br/><br/>Did I mention the hole?  <br/><br/>I fell in it, figuratively speaking which is why I am writing this.<br/><br/>I have photos if anyone is interested.<br/><br/>To close on a positive note... The Grand Hotel on Liberty in Salem is worth every penny.  <br/><br/>Head north my freinds Portland is spectacular!"

12892550,557310603,2019-10-31,25511548,Ulrik B.,I had a great time at Nick and Julias' place. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The neighborhood is very conveniently located in Salem. Would absolutely recommend to stay there!
12892550,563699467,2019-11-13,25620333,Phil,This is a great house in a great location. I stay here regularly when I am traveling to Salem for work.
12892550,573635603,2019-12-06,44342773,Amanda,"This house was conveniently located and the cost of the room was not egregrious.  It feels like a strange accommodation with one longer term tenant, but otherwise empty.  Because it is lived in, not all spaces felt particularly cleaned or maintained (there were dishes in the sink all week).  A lot things felt forgotten like the empty container of instant  coffee offered on the counter, the moldy coffee in the coffee pot or the pilled sheets on the bed on which previous occupants hairs lingered.   However,  I was appreciative to have access to a kitchen and the ability to come and go as I pleased.  The internet was not available when I arrived and since this issue arose the day before, I would have appreciated having been communicated that this was the case and offered a resolution.  The internet was not restored until day 3, which was rather inconvenient for me.  It is what it is and if you need an easy place to stay this should do, but I have opted for a different location for future needs."
12892550,575350370,2019-12-09,42835297,Scott,Excellent location and easy access.

12892550,460162289346724306,2021-09-26,905759,Anjali,"This place is a youth hostel that charges hotel rates - where the bathroom is shared by multiple folks going in and out at all hours of the night. I woke up once and asked a gentleman in another room to keep the loud music down (which he did). This was well after 10PM. The second time one young lady hammered the bathroom door saying ""I know you're in there, you're drunk that's why you wont come out"" - to her roommate in the bathroom. Then they were talking loudly in their room for a while. Most of all there are multiple maskless people going in and out of the house at all hours of the night during COVID. The description makes it seem like there is a host on site. For the cost I paid for this, I could have just booked a hotel room in Newberg for the same price."

Their house was super cute, neat and very accommodating, perfect for working ""from home"" while I was away from home. It was such a pleasure getting to meet their daughter, Vanessa as well! Not to mention, they had the cutest three little Shitzus! I would have loved to visit with them and get to know them a bit more, had I had more time. I'd definitely stay with them again when I come back! "

Their basement is as pictured;<br/>private, spacious, clean - with a comfortable bed in a separate bedroom and full bath, as well as a nice living area including TV and fixings for coffee, tea , snacks.  Their backyard is a lovely space to<br/>relax.  The location is a safe, fairly convenient suburban<br/>neighborhood of upscale homes in West Salem.  Delia and Bob themselves were the best part of my stay - they were warm, fun, and most welcoming.  I enjoyed a great breakfast with them, and homemade chicken soup on my first night there, blackberries from their garden, and their three adorable little dogs.  A stay at this lovely<br/>home is highly recommended.<br/>"

We contacted them while driving in hopes of finding something close and quick since we were on a 4+ hour drive already and we're ready to call it a night. Not only did they respond within minutes but we were able to use Instant book to confirm our stay and were enroute to their house (or a restaurant near their house for a quick bite) within 15 mins. They greeted us when we parked and showed us right to our space. The family made sure we were comfortable and no had what we needed then left us to settle in. The space is very comfortable and they offer a variety of amenities. Very thoughtful. We left after they did, at least we think so as it was very quiet upstairs when we headed out. The electronic door lock made it easy for us to leave quickly and get on the road again. Comfortable, easy, convenient and great communication. It was the perfect pitstop!"

They warmly welcomed us the first night and checked frequently during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed.  Our bedroom, living room, and bathroom were exquisitely furnished with all the comforts of home.  There’s even a piano!  The small refrigerator and Keurig were very much appreciated.  They even changed our towels after two nights!  We came to Salem to see family and the solar eclipse, and we watched it right outside their home with other neighborhood families.  Bob and Delia made sure we were included, bringing out lawn chairs and bottled water for us.   We met as strangers but left as friends and hope our “celestial” paths cross again.

The bedroom, bathroom and lounge space were very clean and stylish. I had to call Delia to figure out the shower - the trick is to pull on the tub faucet to transfer the water to shower - she was very nice about my inability to figure it out, lol! The bed is super comfortable too, with great fluffy pillows. I didn't use much else as I was really just there to sleep, but there's a big screen tv, mini fridge and microwave, Keurig coffee machine and comfortable seating area. Lovely place and lovely people. If my daughter chooses Willamette, I hope to come back again when I visit."

Bob and Delia are amazing hosts and went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable.  We were in town for our daughter’s college graduation and they allowed us to ship leis from Hawaii to their address. Unfortunately the leis didn’t arrive in time but they kept checking at the house for the delivery since we were busy with activities.  The unit is super cute and the bed is very comfortable.  Our stay was amazing........we'll definitely be back! Mahalo nui loa Bob & Delia 👍😄💕🎓

13620753,273613260,2018-06-06,67806664,Dele,"The place was beautiful and spotless. Nice touches with coffee makers and a mini fridge. He bed was comfortable and they were very quiet, so the fact that it’s an inside access basement didn’t feel awkward at all. <br/><br/>They have some beautiful small inside dogs that were not in the way, never came near the guest space, and weren’t an issue at all. In the morning they did bark, but we were up at 8, so not a problem. <br/><br/>Delia showed us to the space, for us situated, and was ready to offer local dining suggestions. Later we met Bob and he was just as friendly. <br/><br/>Sometimes it’s nice to have an Airbnb that is separate and private, but in this case, being a guest in someone’s home was great because the hosts were so welcoming and friendly. "

13620753,279836376,2018-06-21,61106367,Cheyenne,"I never really knew hospitality like this before. Us staying at this air bnb was very last minute but I am so glad that we did it. After driving all day from Seattle we were exhausted. We were already running late arriving to Salem in the first place and I didn’t think that anyone would be awake by the time we got there since it was almost midnight but right as we pulled up Bob walked out and was ready and willing to help us carry things and get us settled. Our place was so quiet and I couldn’t even tell it was attached to the rest of the house. I only wish we had more time there but I cannot explain how much that this place was exactly what we needed. The bed was super comfortable, everything was decorated well and it was super easy and convenient to stay there. I can’t say enough about this place. If you have a chance to stay here you should!"

We only spent time here for sleeping and getting ready in the morning, and it was exactly what we needed! After you enter the shared front door, you immediately walk downstairs to a basement suite with private bedroom, bathroom, and living space area! Our hosts were easily accessible when we had questions! It was so nice to stay at their home because we felt safe with them there, but they also gave us plenty of privacy— it felt like our own home!<br/>We’d definitely stay here again! It was very clean, so comfy, safe, warm (and cool—AC! Haha), stylish, and overall just a wonderful place. <br/><br/>Thank you so much Bob & Delia for opening your home to us!!! "

The space was clean (spotless) and the hosts were nice enough to keep us stocked with complimentary waters! Bob and Delia were very friendly, in constant communication, and just make you feel like part of the family. You are surrounded by positive messages in the form of photos and crafts from the second you stand in the driveway, all the way until you fall asleep, which we loved.<br/><br/>Bob and Delia,<br/>Thank you so much! If we come back in the area, we will hopefully be able to book with you again!

The space was decorated so nicely, everything was sparkling clean, there were thoughtful touches like the coffee bar & magazines about the area.

Bob was also very flexible on check in and check out. Only issue (and a minor one at that) was the space wasn't quite as private as expected - no door dividing the upstairs and downstairs. Still a great experience.

Parking is on their driveway pad and access to the room is thru the main entry to the house. There is a keypad but we were met by Bob and Delia - and their adorable dogs.  Nice, quiet residential location. It is exactly as pictured and described!"
13620753,510240201,2019-08-15,52545668,H M (Cade),"I really looked forward to writing this review because Bob and Delia's place was the cleanest, and most uncluttered, place I have ever stayed. It's immaculate and beautiful. It was like staying in a top-rated resort.<br/><br/>Truly, this is a place you want to book when you will be staying in Salem for a week or longer. I only stayed through the night, but it was outstanding for the low cost.<br/><br/>It is located on a quiet cut-de-sac, and you park in a space right next to the garage, so that your vehicle is off the street. There are plenty of directions to run in the morning, if you like to workout.<br/><br/>The guest area is the entire basement. You will have a private bedroom,  bathroom, and a living area. It looked like the paint was new. Flawless.<br/><br/>The bathroom is spotless. The shower looked like it was new, and installed the day before. <br/>The towels and wash clothes were high-grade. (In many AirBnB places, you get mismatched towels that were passed down through the host family.)<br/><br/>The living area was large and comfortable. It had a huge TV, and excellent reading material. The couch was gigantic. I was only in there a few minutes of my stay to set up the WiFi (which connected immediately.)<br/><br/>The bedroom featured a queen bed, a clothing rack, cabinets, and a large computer desk. There are plenty of plug-ins to charge devices. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the bedding was top quality. There is a large window over the bed which allows you to be woken by natural light, if you so choose.<br/><br/>I did not use the kitchen area, because I was meeting a lady for breakfast, but it looked functional and well-equipped.<br/><br/>I talked with Delia on the phone just before I entered their place. She was easy to reach, very positive, and explained things easily. I do not know if she and Bob stayed on the property because I did not hear any movement inside the house.<br/><br/>I do not think you will find a better place in Salem, especially for such a reasonable price. Definitely book this property if you are staying for an extended period of time."
13620753,511721592,2019-08-17,120573041,Mary,Clean and quiet place. Hosts are available if you need anything.

Salem is a beautiful city with lots of beautiful sites to see and great restaurants. The Airbnb is just how it looks in the pictures, and Bob and Delia were really nice.

We felt instantly at home as soon as we entered and really appreciated the warm welcome we received from them upon our arrival. Everything is clean and well-cared-for, and there is even a little electric heater in the bedroom in case you like being on the warmer side. We liked its central location—easy to get to downtown and other popular attractions around the city. If we find ourselves in Salem next time, we would stay at Bob and Delia’s place again! :)"

13620753,603142532,2020-02-08,244280938,Daniel,It's refreshing when you meet people that take pride in providing hospitality.  Bob & Delia highly excel in Airbnb hosting.
13620753,604570228,2020-02-11,45756341,Clifford,"In my opinion, this was the best rental I've had with Airbnb. This is Airbnb done right! Bob and Delia have created a space that is beautifully appointed and extremely clean. The rental included a private bathroom, living area, and bedroom--all with good separation from the rest of the residence. The bed was very comfortable, and thanks to the many wonderful, detailed, and stylish touches, I felt that I had everything I needed. When you walk into the house you are struck by the elegance of the interior design decisions throughout. Although I only needed a place to sleep, it was nice being in such a calming and special space. Due to my schedule, I only had a chance to speak with Bob, but found him to be a very gracious host. I hope to stay at this house again at some point. Bob and Delia, thank you for being such wonderful and diligent hosts!"

13620753,610109822,2020-02-23,27705401,Jeff,"Clean and comfortable place to stay.   You can definitely hear what's going on upstairs and your area isn't completely separated by a door, but overall no real issues.  Don't hesitate to book."

13620753,384834072745037158,2021-06-14,397103624,Michael,"This was our first use of Airbnb, and it encourages us to do this more often.  This was a roomy, comfortable, private space in the basement (there was a window in the bedroom giving some natural light) of Bob and Delia Bothwell’s home.  The quality of the bed linens and bathroom towels was very high, and much appreciated.  The living area was very spacious and had a refrigerator, microwave, Keurig coffee maker, and an adequate supply of plates, cups, and silverware.  There even were two wine glasses and a corkscrew!  <br/>A 65 inch TV was fed by DirecTV, and as we had never had such a system, it took us some time to sort the system out.  I got up to watch a 06:00 Euro 2020 soccer game on Sunday morning and was disappointed I could not watch the game.  The transmission was on ESPNHD and I do not know whether the problem was the TV could not accept HD, or whether DirecTV had a special soccer package.  However, I could watch replays of games, and live transmissions of Copa America soccer - and my wife could watch the French Tennis Final which was on at the same time as the Euro 2020 game and hence there was no fight over which we should watch!<br/>What also was good one had space to the side of the driveway to park a car off the road in a neighborhood where many cars are parked on the road.<br/>The location provides easy access to downtown Salem, and is convenient to several wineries.  We were in the area to attend a wedding at Zenith Vineyard, and also took the opportunity to have a tasting at Evesham Wood winery."

13620753,709452220316534446,2022-09-05,63663300,Alec,One of the best AirBNB hosts I’ve experienced. Bob and Delia worked to accommodate our noise sensitivities during our stay and offered us some delicious dessert while hanging out one evening! The house is gorgeous and surrounding neighborhood serene. Their three dogs are also super adorable!
13620753,713121993536033090,2022-09-10,118595042,Rae,"I really enjoyed my stay at Bob and Delia’s, and I would definitely book again! The rooms were spacious, spotless, and had everything I needed.

13620753,720349726354738620,2022-09-20,171329481,Gary,"My only regret is not booking a longer stay!  And not booking a stay on my return trip through Salem (dates already taken!).  <br/><br/>Clean & comfortable. Quiet neighborhood and directions are straightforward.  A market, 7-11 and Starbucks is a short drive away.  When I arrived, Bob showed me how to get the shower working as it is a bit different than what I expected (and they note in the listing how to activate it and you might overlook that text).   I only stayed one night but it was a good night at Bob & Delia’s."

13620753,766095339251324044,2022-11-22,412166552,Solomon,"""Stellar"" grade in all aspect of AIRBNB hospitality. Delia and Bob's place is by far the best AIRBNB that we stayed at in Oregon. This is a newer house and is located in a safe quiet neighborhood, free parking in their driveway, homey and tastefully decorated spacious living quarter in the basement has lots of natural outside light.  House is just 1.5 miles from a centralized shopping center with supermarket, banks, post office, library, bars, businesses and multiple places to eat at. Included amenities in the living quarter as advertised are readily available.<br/>Best of all, Delia and Bob treated us with generous and genuine hospitality as if we are visiting relatives. Definitely coming back next time we are in town again. Thank you, Delia and Bob for your Super Hospitality. Definitely coming back next time we are in town again."

You could not ask for a better place to stay. It is not a speeder entrance from the home but Bob and Delila go out of there way to not make this a hindrance. I would not let that keep you from staying there.

13960938,97814528,2016-08-28,2935885,Todd,"This was a very nice house in a nice and safe part of Salem.  The room was very comfortable and they actually had two rooms and a private bath separate to the rest of the family so you felt like you had the place to yourself.  The hostess Maria thought of the little things like soap, candles, and spare toothpaste if needed, which does not happen at some Airbnb properties.   The garden was lovely and Maria made me a great omelette with vegetables from the garden and some very good coffee from Hawaii.  It felt more like a quant B&B instead of renting a room in someone's house.  I also got some great restaurant suggestions which were very good too.  I would definitely recommend this place and will definitely go back on my future trips to Salem.  Dog is a bit protective but a real sweetie when she gets to know you.  Great, comfortable place."
13960938,100495577,2016-09-09,92536463,Jose M,"-I was pleased to stay at Maria and Ed's bnb for over a week; they are friendly, good to talk to, laid-back, and trustworthy people. <br/>-The home was quiet, comfy and it projects its own personality full of paintings and other decoration. <br/>-The room and bathroom were clean and since these are situated on the opposite wing to where their rooms are, they offer complete privacy. <br/>-The neighbourhood seems to be secure, and there is a small park to go for a walk/run around the corner; <br/>-Since both Maria and Ed work in the morning I enjoyed the home for my own working and having breakfast in the kitchen or reading in the living room. <br/>For all these reasons, I recommend Maria and Ed's bnb. <br/>Best wishes, JM"
13960938,104200901,2016-09-25,31516286,Karen,"It was as described, clean, tranquile and welcoming. After a long day on the road I need a glass of wine and they more then happy to share a nip with me!"

Top notch, and well worth it! "

The decor and art inside is colorful and bright, I was amazed by it all as soon as I stepped inside. Plus, the  backyard and sunroom are gorgeous. They are full of flowers and succulents, and a great place to sit and do yoga or just relax. The room was also very comfortable and accommodating. My mother and I thoroughly enjoyed our time spent here. I cannot say enough good things about this place. I highly recommend Maria's home!"
13960938,176408435,2017-07-30,12483136,Elsa,"We had a great stay at Ed and Maria's home. Since Maria was out of town, Ed greeted us kindly, showed us where the coffee/tea was, and even offered us a space in the refrigerator should we need it. <br/>Though the entrance is shared, airbnb guests have a lot of privacy as the two airbnb rooms and bathroom are in a separate part of the house. <br/>The home itself is beautiful-- warm colors, natural light, and lots of original artwork. The double bed we stayed in was very comfortable. Ed and Maria go above and beyond by providing extra comforts-- robes and slippers (which we didn't use, but looked very cozy), and things like luxurious lotions in the bathroom. <br/>The house is located in a quiet and safe part of town about an 8 minute drive from downtown Salem. I would definitely stay there again."

I walked to 2 different restaurants for my evening meals.  The guest room(s) and bath, as well as the mini-refrigerator (very convenient!) area are all in a separate wing of the house: very private.  Maria is a very gracious hostess, and I had my coffee in her lovely garden space. This is a great value for a stay in Salem."

If she offers you coffee, tea, wine or chocolate please accept- she loves that!  The accommodations are great, almost like a private suite as the bedroom and bathroom are in a separate part of the house with a little ante room. The room is spacious and well appointed. It’s especially nice to be able to control your heat so the temperature can be adjusted just as you like it. There is plenty of space in the house where you can read and relax. As for the dog- she doesn’t bark much; just enough. Happy travels!"

Maria gave immediate response to our request to stay, she doesn't have an exact time for you to check in which is so nice because you don't feel rushed. Her husband made us feel like we were part of her family. We were invited to a party that she was hosting for her Airbnb friends and they made is feel so welcomed. Her accommodations are so lovely and clean. The extra touches of having a robe and slippers to walk around makes you feel your home away from home. Don't hesitate to stay here if you want to feel at home because you will."

They are being very careful about social distancing protocols, which I appreciate. Even so, Maria was very attentive via texts, and I felt my needs were a priority to them. I appreciated getting fresh flowers several times during my stay!<br/><br/>I walk a lot, and this property is wonderful in that there are many streets in the area filled with huge trees, big hills and glorious vistas.  I walked in the neighborhood every day of the five weeks I was here and loved watching spring come on in this beautiful area. Just a mile or two away are all the shops, banks, and other conveniences of town."

13960938,389139158626463486,2021-06-20,11199279,Becky,"Maria's place provided everything we needed for a short stay in SE Salem.  We didn't need a full kitchen, but there was a microwave, small fridge and kurig machine.  Maria's information/instructions for her place were clear and accurate.   And although some CDC guidelines have eased in regards to Covid, I very much appreciated that Maria is still being very cautious with in-person interaction.   Best of show were the bath towels were bath sheet size! Thanks, Maria"

There is a small fridge, a coffee maker amply stocked including paper cups, paper plates and napkins. There is space for one car to be parked on the street in front of the house. No air conditioner. There is a large ceiling fan over one bed. If it's it out, it won't be enough. Overall a good value, and friendly, communicative hosts."

Maria is very hospitable and her communication through Airbnb email is exceptional. I am thankful that I found this favorably priced, clean, comfortable, well-appointed private suite with such gracious hosts for my extended stay. <br/><br/>The location is also pleasant and convenient. There are excellent places to get food/meals close by as well as easy access to town, OR-22 to the coast and I-5. <br/><br/>I would 100% recommend a stay here."

13960938,497915937166675810,2021-11-17,1665871,Cathy,"Maria's space is great.  It has two bedrooms, private bath and an entry hall with a coffee and tea set-up and microwave.  One bedroom also has a small refrigerator.  It's clean, comfortable and stocked with the basics.  If like me, you are eating out in restaurants or with friends and family it's perfect.  You can reheat your leftovers for a snack and have coffee or tea anytime."

Access to the space was separate from the main house, through the garage. Communication with Maria was timely. We got plenty of notice about the entry code. Parking was convenient. We appreciated the extra touches of filtered water in the little fridge and the basket of items that are often forgotten-new toothbrushes, toothpaste, and floss."
13960938,563838028000835620,2022-02-16,98961801,Danish,Great stay on our week trip in salem. Having separate entrance is really nice since I would be in and out quite a bit. The only drawback back was the main bed was a little creaky otherwise no issues
13960938,566784581365836988,2022-02-20,120954952,Laura,This place was spotless and quiet.  Maria seemed very available.  But it would have been nice to have a TV as well as a way to lock the unit from the outside and the house!

It was so helpful to have the Keurig, coffee, and tea, the refrigerator, and microwave. We appreciated how clean everything was, especially the bathroom. The neighborhood is very quiet and walkable. This is one of the best Airbnbs I've stayed."

13960938,584106297787609949,2022-03-16,265767148,Gabriella,"Truly one of the best places to stay in Salem, we were a little hesitant because it was only a private room but it is TRULY private! Separate entrance with a bathroom and even a fridge/microwave. Maria was extremely responsive as we had booked hours before check-in after our previous hotel reservations fell through. Willing to share knowledge about Salem and give help wherever needed. 1000% recommend and will most likely book again!"

13960938,615273938280764301,2022-04-28,235487823,Kathy,Comfortable enough but when you leave there is no way to lock up your belongings. Would have been more comfortable if I known someone couldn’t have access when I was in there.  The solarium was beautiful and serine.
13960938,623255139568124726,2022-05-09,119700274,Mike,2nd time staying at this Airbnb. Great value and  location. Maria is an excellent host. I'll be back soon.
13960938,629814308100740477,2022-05-18,259657750,Micaela,"We had little to no interaction with the hosts but the interaction we did have were pleasant.  The space did the job, a place to sleep. It's not a truly private space because you cannot lock up your belongings. The rooms are straight off the kitchen, so you can hear everything going on. there was no access to the atrium as the photos might suggest and no window covering on the atrium window.  People with anxiety about privacy might find those two things triggering. <br/>This space would greatly be fit from some upgrades, but overall it did what it needed to, provide a place to sleep.  It was a good value for the price for sure and we're super grateful for that."
13960938,633408420165480674,2022-05-23,47415598,Diego,"Clean space with easy access to rented area. Free Keurig coffee available with fresh cream in the half size fridge. Lots of amenities available in case you forgot to pack something (tooth brush, razors, etc.) Parking spot available on the street in front of house. Free wifi. This is my second visit to this property. It's located in a nice neighborhood that is very quiet!"
13960938,639150888328623513,2022-05-31,443906521,Karena,"Maria was very kind, and got back to me as soon as she could. The space was very cute, however, I didn't realize the space to the solarium/sunroom required us going into the family living space. That meant having a door that remained unlocked between the airbnb space and the living space. I did not realize that would be the case and we did not use that space because we did not feel comfortable going through it. Other than that, the place was a beautiful location, very close to downtown!"
13960938,642870740903489455,2022-06-05,99006972,Brittany,"Maria is such a lovely host, so friendly and accommodating!

There is a mini fridge, a microwave, Maria has a keurig coffee machine with coffee pods and tea and even creamer and water available. There is air conditioning. The shower and bathroom were clean and they included little amenities like toothpaste, shampoo, towels, and a hair dryer (which I forgot). Check in is easy and there is a way to lock the door if your concerned about safety (I was not). It’s quiet and in a nice quiet neighborhood. There was no tv but that was not an issue for us because they provide you with the WiFi. I would stay here again for sure. Good price, nice host, she got to me right away and it was clean and cozy."

Extremely quiet (I wouldn't have realized I was part of the overall household) and easy to get back and forth to downtown.  My ONLY minor caution might be that if you are taller than 6'2"" the shower is going to be a challenge.  I brushed the ceiling in the shower!  But for cozy and quiet it was just what was asked for!"

14017093,90589043,2016-08-01,18663491,Suzanne,"The place was easy to find and easy to park at. It was close to everything needed. I was only there overnight for a quick place to stay mid-traveling, but it was perfect for what I needed, there's no way to find a hotel so nice at such a great rate. The basement area helped make it feel more private. I'd definitely stay again if I needed a place to sleep in the area. "
14017093,91235248,2016-08-04,1840972,Kelly,"Casey provided a great place for me to stay for my stopover in Salem!

Very comfortable, affordable and would definitely stay again!"
14017093,91403348,2016-08-05,86901544,River,"So so so welcoming! I would advise this stay for any Airbnb traveler. We had the whole downstairs/basement to our selves & it was very clean. The hosts were great as well, very helpful and kind people. Definitely recommend! "

The listing was everything it said it would be.  The house is in a nice quiet neighborhood.  I would stay here again if in the area.
14017093,96382962,2016-08-22,89714718,Parker,"Everything was as promised, clean and conveniently placed in Salem. I didn't see a mention of a kitten in the review, but I packed Claritin just in case. I'm glad I did because it is the cutest kitten ever and it wound up cuddling with me. No regrets at all, would definitely recommend the place for budget conscious travelers. "

14017093,123534617,2016-12-29,49041228,Lauren,"Our stay at Casey's place was great! We only stayed one night, but Casey and Suzanne made us feel at home right away. The rooms were comfortable and clean and it was a great place for us to relax after a long drive. Our hosts allowed us to bring our cat as well, so it's nice to be able to stay in a pet-friendly place. They provided a good list of restaurants nearby, which was very handy for us as we had never been to Salem before. "
14017093,125607347,2017-01-06,72430387,Blake,"Casey and his family  is the go to host for Salem! Their home is an amazing value in a beautiful neighborhood of Salem. The basement apartment was extremely neat and clean, while providing amenities that made it feel homely. I would highly recommend. "

14017093,127355600,2017-01-17,88710263,Amber,"The two rooms with our own TV and mini fridge were like a little private apartment, which was nice after our long, tiring days around town. Bathroom was very clean and well-equipped, but very, very cold- I don't think these houses in the Northwest are insulated as well for unusually cold weather. Our rooms stayed cozy and warm though, with built-in wall heating units and we slept well. Would stay again on our next visit to Salem!"
14017093,128955181,2017-01-28,1878112,Carol,"Our stay at Casey and Suzanne's was very short and we had to sneak out quite early in the morning, so didn't have much interaction with our hosts, but they were very welcoming when we arrived. The bed was comfortable and our teenage son enjoyed a good night's sleep on the couch. The bathroom was very clean with a good shower and a space heater for warmth. Our hosts kindly fulfilled a special request and washed our bedding with unscented detergent. This was a great value for our family and very convenient for our visit to Willamette University."
14017093,129561346,2017-01-31,11265184,Danielle,Comfortable stay in a cute community. Nice to have a separate basement room and Casey was great with communication and my late arrival!

14017093,133778927,2017-02-24,117116455,Kindra,This was our first airbnb experience because another arrangement fell through and Casey was quick to let us stay last minute and make us feel welcome. Such a cozy private room and loved the deco. Definitely recommended! 
14017093,133968117,2017-02-25,31110460,Giselle,"The downstairs area is nicely decorated, super cozy, and very clean. We felt instantly home. Also, we LOVED their book collection! You can really tell a lot about a family by the books on their bookshelf and from everything they had on display in the guest bedroom, they are top-notch :) If I'm ever back in the area I'll definitely try to stay with them again!"
14017093,135690025,2017-03-05,1965917,Tammy,"South Salem is the nicest part of town, and this is a nice, quiet neighborhood, even with the high school right there. The bed was pretty comfy, and again, 2 rooms!"
14017093,136136712,2017-03-08,27407100,Jan,At Casey's place I felt like home. Warm greeted we got everything we needed. Our rooms and bathroom were clean and cost. Overall I highly recommend it.

14017093,138433021,2017-03-19,20130885,Kimberly,Clean and comfortable space to stay. Comfortable bed and separate living area. Host was helpful but unobtrusive. Not far from restaurantschool and shops. Individual controlled heat and wi-fi access. Great bargain for a quick overnight stay. 
14017093,138965578,2017-03-22,121870563,Judis,The home is very warm and inviting. The hosts are kind and hospitable. I would go back to stay again for the reading selection in the room alone.

14017093,149736601,2017-05-05,5870561,Megan,"Casey's place is a great value for the gem that it is.  It's quite close to downtown and very comfortable.  We had our own living room connected to the bedroom, s it was private and spacious.  The whole family was lovely and friendly.  I spend so much time chatting with their son, Jackson, that I almost made myself late!  Casey was also a great communicator and was flexible with arrival/check in times so that we could just move through our day as we desired without feeling pressured to get to the house.  It was a nice stay for such a short visit to Salem."
14017093,149978970,2017-05-06,41726614,Kurtis,My girlfriend and I stayed the night and very much enjoyed our stay! This place is perfect with its own living space and a bedroom! Also if you are a book lover she has them all. My Girlfriend spent hours going through the books and there is some originals that you don't see everyday. I would definitely recommend Casey's place for anyone going to be in the area of Salem! 
14017093,150382207,2017-05-07,118345038,Gregg,Looking forward to staying there again!
14017093,151235819,2017-05-11,32512524,Caylin,Very nice hosts and a good location.
14017093,156101949,2017-05-29,121397022,Rachel,"The location is great!  Salem itself has a lot to offer, with some really cute restaurants and a beautiful capital building. We loved The Kitchen on Court Street, Venti's, The Governor's Cup, Archive Coffee and Bar and Acme's Cafe- all of which are within 10 minutes of Casey's Place. Portland is an easy hour drive.<br/><br/>Our accommodations were incredibly clean and it was so convenient having the mini fridge and microwave right there in our space. <br/><br/>Casey and his family were all so friendly and welcoming.  Communication was prompt and clear.  <br/><br/>I would definitely stay here again if I am ever in the area!  "
14017093,157148397,2017-06-02,5870561,Megan,This was my second time staying at Casey's. It was just as convenient and pleasant! They are welcomed by hosts but the space also provide a feeling of autonomy and privacy. I'd happily stay again if I'm in town!
14017093,157388082,2017-06-03,78309707,Alaina,We booked day of and Casey was very accommodating. The room was perfect. 
14017093,159109689,2017-06-09,73837315,Sarah,"this is a perfect place to stop by and rest any day, or even if your looking to stay for a couple days. thia is the perfect quite place you wanna be at. the room that i stayed in was kept very clean and also was the little personal living room. this was the lower section of the house wich was the basement. everything very well organized. the part that i enjoyed the most was when i would lay in bed and hear the piano playing in the top living room. the kids are great at that. it was relaxing and calming. also the cat that comes in and out of the house is very friendly, and loves to get scratched lighlty on her neck:) so if your looking for a place to crash for a night, a week, or more, this is the spot. "
14017093,159346209,2017-06-10,74196137,John,"This is a wonderful stay for a low cost and just delightful. While it is a basement room, the house is older so you might hear some creaks, and the bathroom is upstairs, it was very comfortable, clean, and the hosts are very kind and welcoming. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
14017093,160834523,2017-06-15,126527017,Matthew,"Had an absolutely phenomenal stay.  You have an entire bedroom and living room to relax  filled with books or Amazon tv, A mini fridge and, microwave. There was so much more than I expected and that's how I felt about my entire stay. Would definitely stay again if I had the chance and totally recommend it!"
14017093,161909521,2017-06-18,85503112,Inger,"My friend and I traveled to Salem for a nosework trial with our dogs and Casey graciously allowed us, and our two dogs, to stay. There are two rooms so my friend took the bedroom and I took the blow up mattress. It was very comfortable!! Their house was easy to find and close to anything we needed (gas, food, groceries, etc). We will definitely return if we're in the area again! I highly recommend them!"
14017093,165726822,2017-07-02,134304596,Christine,"Clean, comfortable and homey.  Photos do not do the place justice.  Lovely area to sit in the backyard.  Hosts and friendly, kind and helpful.  Excellent experience!"

The bed is comfortable, and the rooms neat and tidy. The home is situated in a quiet neighborhood, and offers a beautiful deck in a private backyard. This is just a wonderful place to stay."

14017093,182083100,2017-08-13,93152299,Charlie,"Such a beautiful home and an amazing family. They were so kind. The house location is amazing, the yard is beautiful, the room is clean.<br/>They have an amazing selection of books for down time. Plus they were also fans of The Office and Parks and Recreation, so obviously they have amazing taste.<br/>I wish there was a family and home like this every place I traveled. Couldn't say more positive things about the experience."
14017093,183255632,2017-08-16,5481030,Donna,"Lovely Victorian style house in a pretty area of older historical homes and big trees.  Big downstairs area apartment with a refrigerator, and a separate bedroom.   Comfortable and spacious accomodations.  Casey was a warm and welcoming host. Nice family, with a couple of friendly cats.  We stayed 2 days while house hunting in Salem and surrounding towns.  Several good restaurants in the area."
14017093,183601306,2017-08-17,21975829,Kevin,Was there less than 12 hours but exactly what I needed. Clean and comfortable. Would recommend.

14017093,185062864,2017-08-20,24853133,Mindi,Salem is perfect for an Oregon getaway--close to Portland and close to all the beautiful Oregon scenery. Casey's home is absolutely lovely and he was very patient with my friend and I who miscalculated how long our road trip from northern California would take and when I needed to be out late to visit a loved one. Thanks for everything!
14017093,185859064,2017-08-22,124418529,Elias,Stayed for the eclipse. Most reasonable accommodations we could find. The listings' pictures are accurate.
14017093,187856973,2017-08-27,28306963,Cindy,"The two rooms were spacious and very clean, with little accents of hospitality like water/beer in the fridge, extra blankets, books. Casey and Suzanne were very hospitable and helpful with a wonderful and friendly family atmosphere. Very beautiful neighborhood with amazing proximity to downtown and lots of walking. The downside, which is not a surprise and is clearly advertised is the shared bathroom which requires careful maneuvering to be sure you can shower/etc in a timely manner. This was a minor inconvenience for all the positive attributes; particularly the privacy of having an entire basement with tons of space at a very reasonable price. I rate 10/10!!"
14017093,189138908,2017-08-31,4224589,Kevin,Great basement apartment in a cute house! Casey was super helpful. Enjoyed our stay.

14017093,192611119,2017-09-10,24769728,Jennifer,My boyfriend and I ended up booking  Casey's place last minute as we were traveling up the coast and weren't able to find a camping spot on a Saturday night. Unfortunately we didn't get to meet them during our short stay but Casey was very communicative and more than happy to point us to some cool spots in Salem. The house is great and the downstairs room is very cute and cozy. Casey is a great host.
14017093,195267281,2017-09-18,28375314,Katelyn,"This place was wonderful. Clean, accurately depicted in the photos and very accommodating host! Would definitely recommend and return!"

14017093,216401263,2017-12-03,17383131,Brian,"I stay frequently in Salem. Casey has a great large private space. Very relaxing, great location close the Bush Park. The room has a nice library with reading selections that appeal to all. I look forward to staying again."
14017093,216955537,2017-12-06,31608057,Gianina,Casey’s place is adorable and a great price for a cozy stay. Wonderful hospitality and a sweet family. There are cats which I don’t mind but if you’re allergic it may be an issue. <br/>Quite nice neighborhood and clean home. <br/>I’d definitely stay again!
14017093,218043854,2017-12-10,11724398,Michelle,Very comfortable place and extremely economical.  Casey made sure all needs were met and questions answered.  Highly recommend.

14017093,220757526,2017-12-23,15146690,John,"Great value, stayed a second night on my return trip"
14017093,222090235,2017-12-28,100713082,Susan,"I chose Casey's place because it was close to my daughters. My stay was only for 1 night so I didn't need a lot. However, I was really pleased with the size of this place. It's more like a Suite and completely private. It's well worth the money. Just a tip the Alarm clock has USB ports for charging your phone. Good find! Also,  I can't forget to mention there is nice book selection and magazines too.  <br/><br/>So, I do have to mention that for the most part this place is very self contained. However, you'll have to step out of this comfy setting and go upstairs to get to the bathroom. I would stay again  and I highly recommend it to others. As a single female traveler I found Caseys to be a safe family environment."
14017093,224920962,2018-01-04,102483868,Norman,"As basement rooms go, very nice with a window. As Casey states separate bathroom is upstairs"
14017093,225489370,2018-01-06,77137380,Roxanna,Casey and his family showed me great kindness and hospitality upon my arrival. I greatly appreciated them allowing me to stay on such short notice and for being flexible with my check-in time. <br/><br/>They have a very lovely and cozy home. They have added their own unique touch that makes you feel welcome. The main bedroom was very cozy and the second room was nice for chilling and watching TV. I also appreciated the many books that were in the rooms. Would highly recommend!
14017093,226607741,2018-01-11,165912484,Christina,Very friendly hosts! CLEAN and Private room.

14017093,232420844,2018-02-04,28306963,Cindy,"The basement bedroom and living room are very private and tucked away. The bathroom is just at the top of the stairs. It is such a pleasant, clean environment in a beautiful, old historic neighborhood. This is the second time I’ve stayed here and my husband has stayed here separately as well while we visit our daughter at Willamette University. "

14017093,235176564,2018-02-15,97713683,Leann,"We only stayed for one night, but really enjoyed our time in Casey's home. The space was a bedroom and a small living space with lots of thoughtful touches. We would highly recommend this location!"
14017093,235445093,2018-02-16,2624480,Johanna,"Casey's place was very comfortable and even though our after midnight arrival was probably later than he would have preferred, he was very nice and accommodating and left the door unlocked for us. It worked well for our quick stay in Salem and I would recommend staying there!"
14017093,236645371,2018-02-19,100877135,Charanpreet,Casey and family were nice and welcoming and I felt right at home with them.
14017093,237385858,2018-02-22,20246676,Gareth,"Amazing place in Salem. A cozy space to stay in a wonderful house. Casey and his family are great, we managed to get a late booking even though they were out from the house. The check in process was super easy too."
14017093,237936642,2018-02-24,855846,Lisa,"Easy stay in a family home finished basement -- warm, comfortable space, movies on demand, great price, parking right out front.  Even though guests are sharing a family home, there's a designated guest bathroom (different floor from guest bedroom).  Casey is a clear and timely communicator.  Thanks much!"
14017093,242363951,2018-03-11,120817879,Perry,"I was only there for a single night but it was the perfect place to crash. Check-in was handled most efficiently by their cool cat, Carl. Casey was more than accommodating of my uncertain schedule. The two rooms are very quiet, with plenty of privacy. Definitely, a great location <5 minutes from downtown or Willamette. I'll be back."
14017093,244876040,2018-03-19,98065902,Tim,"Casey and Suz were great hosts. The children have impeccable manners. Even the cat was nice. I found the bed comfortable, and my unusual schedule didn't  seem to bother them. They even provided a small desk for me to use for my work."
14017093,245103405,2018-03-20,172925100,Christopher,Perfect stop before heading to Portland. Casey and his family are very kind and we appreciated that he let us arrive so late.
14017093,246082006,2018-03-24,92695090,Kevin,"This house was awesome.  You have your own private bedroom and living room with a tv and couch.  It was warm, cozy, clean, and comfortable.  The hosts were very helpful and their family (including their cat) were very welcoming.  My wife and I would stay again in a heartbeat!"
14017093,247474096,2018-03-28,176143444,Sina,"Quiet, lovely, affordable place and very friendly hosts. We stayed there for one night and liked everything. <br/>Even restaurants and shops are only a short walk away. The bed was very comfy!"
14017093,253238257,2018-04-13,99773378,Allison,"On a tour of PNW colleges with my daughter - this was a perfect spot to have a quick overnight. Casey was very responsive and super flexible. The price was affordable for us, and it was a quick drive to downtown. I have to admit I felt a little awkward going upstairs to use the bathroom, but the family seemed totally fine with it and let us have our space. Great hosts (and yes, AWESOME book selection)!! My daughter started ""Ready Player One"" while there, so I of course had to buy it for her while at the college bookstore ;)"
14017093,253529440,2018-04-14,184000930,Michael,"Very friendly folks, affordable, they invite you in like family friends, great conversation and selection of books, a bedroom and living space as well as a dedicated bathroom"
14017093,255497326,2018-04-20,119957418,Brandon,"Couldn't ask for kinder people to stay with. We had never stayed at an airbnb without a private entrance before, so that was something we had to get used to, although the host and his family seemed very comfortable with us coming and going at our convenience. <br/>Really cool neighborhood, great value for the location."
14017093,255812395,2018-04-21,169418781,Alison,"Cozy, clean and comfortable just like home! I immediately felt welcome upon arriving for my one night stay and would return again."
14017093,257078871,2018-04-24,7700878,Jeff,"The accommodations are modest but roomy. The back deck is gorgeous. I’m not crazy about Salem, but if you have business there, it is central to everywhere. It is a great value."
14017093,258806369,2018-04-29,87645082,Heidi,Most definitely would recommend this home to stay at.
14017093,262680605,2018-05-09,179626210,Karen,My stay at Casey’s was wonderful. They are amazing hosts. Would go back for sure.
14017093,264809905,2018-05-14,1388539,Dan,"We had a wonderful 5 night stay with Casey and his family. They were very warm, welcoming and hospitable. I would recommend them and would stay there again when in Salem. Great spot for parents visiting students at Willamette University."
14017093,265080962,2018-05-15,58217993,Miranda,Had a lovely stay. Room was cozy and the hosts were lovely! (And accepted a very last minute request!)

14017093,270299761,2018-05-28,173293263,Nicholas,"A great first Airbnb experience for me. Room was just as described. Very comfortable and private two rooms. Great location close to downtown. Super friendly hosts that are happy to chat, or let you keep to yourself. Definitely recommend!"
14017093,270644493,2018-05-29,61862783,Olivia,Convenient location and beautiful home. The living room space with the bedroom felt very relaxing and homey.

14017093,282569780,2018-06-27,21420254,Seth,"There is a living room and bedroom in the basement of the house. Very cool setup, offers plenty of privacy. Very cozy and clean"
14017093,283351916,2018-06-29,198369605,Jeff,"Quaint little stylish family home 10 minuets from downtown Salem. Private bedroom and den in basement studio. Bathroom and entrance upstairs in family living space. Very friendly folks: children were accustomed to having guests around; I had plenty of privacy and quiet, but they were very hospitable and helpful. Great communication via app!"
14017093,286621311,2018-07-06,9390155,Tom,"Hosts were amazingly helpful and welcoming.   A great ""welcome to Salem!"""
14017093,288825611,2018-07-10,56538473,Justin,"Very Nice Neighborhood, close to literally anything you need. The house has so many neat little touches from all the great furniture to the book collection and the quotes from “Parks and Rec.” to the Star Wars Bottle opener."
14017093,290047454,2018-07-13,11979634,Virginie,Super belle maison et super accueil comme des amis invités. Belle confiance des hôtes de nous accueillir dans leur belle maison. Nous avions accès à un petit studio 2 chambres dans le sous-sol super bien aménagé avec <br/>Mini frigo et micro-onde. Nous avons très bien dormi et les chambres étaient fraîches malgré la grande chaleur de 100 degrés dehors! Merci beaucoup beaucoup à nos hôtes de partager leur maison avec des gens de passage. Parfait pour une famille de 3!
14017093,291431113,2018-07-15,194509899,Scott,This was a great place to stay.  It is in the heart of the historical district and easy to get places.  The host was wonderful and extremely helpful.  They meet my wife and I and made us feel at home.  
14017093,292321386,2018-07-17,158595906,Henry,"Place was great, bedroom and living room all to myself"
14017093,293179115,2018-07-19,59294027,Katie,"Its a very cute and comfortable house! We do enjoy our stay! Casey, Thank you for everything!"
14017093,295071624,2018-07-22,123978532,Ashley,Comfy bed and cozy decorative touches made for an accommodating stay. 
14017093,297955333,2018-07-28,182970427,Elizabeth,"Cozy, plenty of space to put our 13 month to bed and be able to hang out with out waking her. The host was definitely our kind of people. Ron Swanson quotes and sitcom lover. 😆💕"
14017093,299344259,2018-07-30,172539666,Robert,very friendly family<br/>
14017093,300264455,2018-08-01,32186091,Jennifer,"I have found my go-to spot to stay in Salem! I stayed here, traveling with my toddler and infant, and it was a fantastic stay. The setup allowed for easy nap and sleep time with that separate room (those with kids know what I mean). The basement included a bedroom and a living room, plenty of privacy, with refrigerator and microwave. Would have been nice to have a sink in the room, but the kitchen was just up the stairs. A list of local restaurants was provided to give recommendations for dining. We enjoyed our stay very much! "
14017093,302539070,2018-08-05,192161458,Mikaela,"Never had the chance to meet Casey or his family, but check in was very easy! He was friendly over message and easy to communicate with. We were really impressed with how clean, spacious, and cute everything was! It was a great place to stay after a long night of driving. We wish we could have stayed longer to play with all the games and read all the books. Their cat Karl was ridiculously cute and friendly. 10/10 would recommend and we would definitely stay here again if we come back to Oregon. "
14017093,305106774,2018-08-10,203019206,John,"Casey and Suz have a beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood, close to just about anywhere you would need in Salem. The room is a great choice if privacy is your thing. The space is nice and clean, and when we went, the mini fridge was stocked with beverages from water to IPA. They do have a cat, but he is a total sweetheart. And finally, this is a good stay if you love a good read: they’ve got tons of books and they’re right there in your room. I wouldn’t just stay again, I’d move in :)"
14017093,305681253,2018-08-11,175510270,Esmeralda,It was my first time staying at an Airbnb and it was a great first experience! The room was very clean and they even had little snacks for us when we got there. Definitely would recommend! 
14017093,306474843,2018-08-12,99246537,Anika,"This place was cute and exactly what we expected. Casey, the host was very response to any questions we had. They were a great host! 10/10 would stay again."
14017093,309158928,2018-08-17,12550625,Summer,"Great place to stay!  Such a nice, accommodating family:)  Adorable neighborhood and beautiful backyard!  I definitely recommend staying here!"

14017093,317131813,2018-09-01,77057672,Martina,"I can't complain too much because honestly when looking for a place I valued price over comfortability, but I do almost wish that I had put out a little extra money now. For a $50 stay, it wasn't bad. But if it would've cost any more than that I would've been a little more upset with the quality of the stay. Just a couple of concerns, there is not very much privacy. You do have the whole bottom floor to yourself but you can hear everything thats going on outside the house and in the floors above through the vents. Whenever someone flushes a toilet or starts the shower (the pipes must run by the room) it makes a sound so loud that it would wake us up sometimes. Also the little windows in the room don't have proper curtains or blinds, you can always see into our room and you could watch little feet running by through the window. The cleanliness of the room and bathroom were up to par, and it was a nice touch that they were kind enough to supply the room with some snacks (fig bars) and drinks (la Croix) for the guests which came in handy. It made for a cheap, quick stay but I would not recommend for people planning on staying long amounts of time."
14017093,318534527,2018-09-03,183119492,Janne,We had a warm welcome and a good stay at Caseys place. You can park your car in front of the house and you've your own bathroom. It's a good place for visiting the city centre of Salem and go into the nature.
14017093,319956501,2018-09-07,35247411,Roshni,"Such a sweet family, and it felt very cozy and safe there.  Very spacious basement space, we had everything that we needed!  =)"
14017093,320388274,2018-09-08,74507031,Peter,"Great space, nice layout, very clean, friendly host/ess, all around great place, location and  price point. I will be back soon."
14017093,321181896,2018-09-09,197519096,Alyona,"Dear Casey,<br/>Thank you for welcoming us into your home. It was a pleasure to stay in your cozy basement and perhaps one day we will come visit again. Bed was comfortable, sleeping courters were clean, and we were even able to watch a quick show before bed in the basement living room. Also, the local guide you provided and small extras (bluetooth speaker in bedroom, great drink selection in mini fridge, and delcious fig bars). Thanks again."
14017093,327380846,2018-09-23,1559859,Kale,"Great location in a quiet neighborhood.  This well maintained home was very inviting.  Our basement lodging had two rooms.  The living room had a inflated air mattress which was very comfortable.  The bedroom had a queen bed and was quite cozy.  The refrigerator had drinks available, the microwave had popcorn available and the TV was there for easy access.  The host was very easy to communicate with and the location was perfect.  We are coming back in a month.  Thank you for an awesome stay."

14017093,334669918,2018-10-09,72658007,Corentin,"Nous n’avons pas eu l’occasion de croiser Casey, ce que nous regrettons, elle nous a permis de rentrer chez elle alors que nous sommes arrivés à 1h du matin. Sa gentillesse a été grandement appréciée. Nous avons eu le plaisir d’être accueillis dans sa belle maison qui est tout à fait conforme aux photos. Encore merci Casey !"
14017093,336812457,2018-10-14,120817879,Perry,"The second time staying at Casey’s Cottage was as good as the first. A comfortable bed, a clean bathroom and a convenient location. Close to downtown Salem, Willamette University, and the secret trail to Minto-Brown Park. A great value, too."
14017093,337842535,2018-10-17,178116656,Samantha,Such a cozy place for such an awesome price! Great space and accommodations. Close to everything in Salem. Quiet and quaint area to be staying. Family is very friendly and accommodating. They make you feel like it's your area while you're there!

14017093,339669617,2018-10-21,1559859,Kale,"Quick responses, clean basement living/sleep quarters, wonderful hosts....what more do you want?  Loved it.  Second visit and can't wait for the next.  Used the back deck on a Saturday afternoon for a quick pint....YES!  Living room air mattress was good for our daughter.  Having a separate area for the adults was even better.  Thank you."
14017093,340694512,2018-10-24,76222295,Christa,Casey was very responsive to my inquiries and flexible in accommodating my needs.
14017093,341776585,2018-10-27,219990335,Lee,This was a really nice place to crash for the night.  Everything was as expected and the host was very communicative.
14017093,343186104,2018-10-30,20123243,Bill,Casey welcomed me with a smile at short notice one night when I was travelling through Oregon at the end of a long day. He was hospitable and tolerant of me being exhausted and not too coherent! His place was clean and the airbnb space downstairs feels private and really cosy. I only wish I'd had a bit more time to make use of the rest of the space!
14017093,343791153,2018-11-01,76222295,Christa,Always a great experience staying at Casey's!

14017093,355384644,2018-12-03,218856261,Carmen,It reminded me of staying at a bed and breakfast from when I was a child down in the SF Bay Area. Great Family and Amazing home. A step back to the best part of the Past!! Will definitely be a return guest. It was so COZY and stylish and just perfect for my #mombreak weekend in Salem OR
14017093,356263037,2018-12-07,28306963,Cindy,"This is a fantastic place!! The decor is charming with lots of extra touches like a desk, books, a mini fridge and microwave. It is very spacious and private with two rooms; a living area with a great TV and a bedroom. The neighborhood is historic and beautiful and near downtown. And best of all is Casey’s hosting and wonderful welcoming atmosphere. Thanks Casey and Suzanne!!"

14017093,433063650,2019-04-05,224149270,Jenny,"This is a sweet space located very close to many eateries and a nice, quiet neighborhood. It is a basement space in a beautiful, historic home with active children, so do not come expecting the quietest of spaces. The room does have a sound machine to help with the creaks old homes can make at night, and that was perfect for our stay (thank you for that special touch hosts!). And the children were sweet and had quiet hours, so we didn't experience any issues being in the basement of an active family. The bed was very comfy and the on-demand TV options were awesome after a long, tiring day out and about in the area. This was a fabulous stay at a wonderful price point."
14017093,437581933,2019-04-14,233027434,Dezeri,"Wonderfully warm and welcoming.  It made my first ever AirBNB experience so awesome!  Clean, comfortable and beautiful.  This family was so sweet and let us do our own thing, they had great knowledge of local area.  House was immaculate!"

14017093,498983154,2019-07-30,266709276,Darnell,"My stay at Casey's place has been nothing but amazing. The hospitality she and her family have shown me made me feel welcome and made my visit a lot more comforting. The room provided is also very spacious and has everything you'll need for a short trip to Salem, Oregon. She also provided a list of places and sites to visit within the room for whenever you find yourself wondering what to do next. Overall she has been a really thoughtful host for her guests and ensures you feel welcome for your entire visit. I'll surely book here again for my next visit to Salem 😊😁"
14017093,500761733,2019-08-02,44530780,Brian,We had a nice stay at Casey’s place.  Communication and check in was easy.  We were only their one night but would definitely recommend them for your stay in the Salem area.
14017093,508977474,2019-08-13,19529909,Laura,"Casey's whole family are wonderful hosts. The rooms are comfortable and nicely decorated and include nice extras like games, puzzles, and books. The house is within easy driving distance of Willamette University or about a 1.5 mile walk along pleasant residential streets."
14017093,509605442,2019-08-14,238971339,Ken,Casey was quick to respond to a last minute reservation. Everything was just as represented with no surprises.

14017093,530474645,2019-09-15,25376812,Debra,"Cute space in a home inhabited by a wonderful family. Cozy & sweet in a beautiful neighborhood. Loved Suzanne & Casey- their darling kids and 2 super sweet cats. Couple was super accommodating (gave this unprepared PNW traveler an umbrella for a long walk!). On the rainy Sunday, just wanted to stay in bed in the basement all day (but had to leave!!) Tip: Don’t wear socks on basement steps!"
14017093,531559856,2019-09-17,11767328,Tracey,"The downstairs space was perfect and ample for our (myself and sis in law) needs. Air mattress  option was necessary and was very comfortable and set up in completely out of the way spot. Bathroom location upstairs, through the kitchen and down hallway past family bedrooms is not an ideal situation but not a total drawback for us. Quaint neighborhood with awesome doughnut shop very nearby. Loved being able to check in at any hour that was convenient for us and that made staying here one of the best things about it with regard to why we needed a place to stay very near Commercial and/or Kuebler."
14017093,537503839,2019-09-28,13127414,Robbi,We stayed for only 1 night. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean with the amenities we needed; the most important parts of any stay.  The neighborhood was nice to walk around with my pup. Excellent hosts!
14017093,540543435,2019-10-03,297584049,Meghan,Great place to stay! One of the best Airbnbs I've ever stayed at. They are also very welcoming.

I liked it so much, I extended my stay twice and stayed 4 days. Wonderful hosts, very nice, they even fed me one night. I would definitely stay here again."

14017093,610153041,2020-02-23,28306963,Cindy,"I have stayed at Casey and Suzanne’s house many times visiting my daughter at Willamette. It’s an amazing space, very beautifully and warmly decorated. There is lots of room; a two room basement area with a living room and bedroom. Their family is lovely, the area is a wonderful location in the Bush Park<br/>Neighborhood, and it’s always a treat for me to stay with them."
14017093,615996307,2020-03-08,178523618,Zac,This was the best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had! 10 out of 10 would recommend

14017093,638804237,2020-07-16,31736170,Jen Drake,"Sparkling clean, great family, gave us privacy but were incredibly friendly! Let our toddler bounce on the trampoline out back and let us wash our toddler's soiled clothes. I highly recommend this place, would go back again! Beautiful back yard, spacious in the downstairs area, quiet, private. Thank you Casey & Family for your welcome and relaxed environment!"
14017093,647419964,2020-08-06,356419165,Tiana,"The cutest cozy cottage you'll ever stay in! Casey & Fam were amazing and so kind! Kitties are so adorable! They will send you to the best places and have the best food reccomendations! If you book with anyone else, you'll be really missing out! Great people and a great trip!!"
14017093,649901307,2020-08-11,39660668,Niti,"Casey’s place was very clean, private, and stylish. Had a nice large area in the basement to lounge. Great stay in Salem!"
14017093,661320675,2020-09-06,22622476,Loren,"Good location and hosts were friendly. We had family business, so were not able to spend much time at the apartment. Only drawback was bathroom was upstairs. But location is very convenient."
14077210,90773066,2016-08-02,84085465,Crystal,"This place is great place!  Five stars. No complaints. It is a unique, lovely 2nd floor art gallery space in a very nice neighborhood. Hosts were appropriately engaged, friendly, while respecting our privacy. Hosts were givers not takers who seemed to take pride in offering outstanding hospitality and facilities. Their genuine motivation seemed to be for us to have a good time. We enjoyed the many small yet useful kindnesses such as fresh cream and almond milk waiting in the fridge for our coffee, along with a plate of freshly baked scones and homemade jam. It is as clean as an art gallery. The courtyard outside is gorgeous, landscaped, with sculptures and mature trees. "
14077210,92225411,2016-08-08,13642409,Melissa,"Mary Lou is a dream! Her passion for art and all that Salem has to offer enhance her natural gift as a hostess. The space is incredible...bright and inviting inside and out. We were in town for our son's wedding (4 days) and busy from morning to night. We couldn't have asked for a more welcoming or peaceful space to come home to each night. Mornings in the garden, warm scones and raspberry preserves, what more could you ask for? It's our new home away from home!❤️"
14077210,93691926,2016-08-13,32533024,Ken,"Our stay started with a welcoming glass of wine and a great discussion of art, travels and sights to be seen in Oregon. Our hosts have created a delightful art focused getaway that honors their proposition ""Art Makes Friends"". Located in the carriage house of their English Tudor home, the apartment is set in a wonderfully whimsical backyard art garden. It's a small comfortable bright studio apartment filled with art.  Perfect for us. Our hosts were completely prepared with information on what to see and do.  Mary Lou always checked in via text to see if we needed anything or had questions. She also provided a wonderful breakfast featuring fruit, granola and delicious home-made scones and/or banana bread. <br/>Our expectations were exceeded at every turn. We arrived as strangers and left with new friends!"
14077210,94006160,2016-08-14,40824800,Penelope And Sarah,"The loft itself is lovely:  clean, spacious, and bright.  It's filled with intriguing art and located in a quiet neighborhood with established homes and gardens, yet still close to restaurants.  <br/><br/>What stands out most, though, is the warmth of Mary Lou and Alan's welcome -- we wished we could have stayed longer!  The amenities (food, beverages, and toiletries) were also better than any AirBnB we've used.  "
14077210,94921800,2016-08-17,410030,Sally,"Beautiful loft with many extra amenities such as beverages, assorted snacks and toiletries if needed. The art is beautiful as well as the interior design. Host was lovely and helpful."
14077210,95758880,2016-08-20,30016433,Joe,"From the moment I met Mary Lou and Alan, I knew that I picked the right place to stay in Salem. To simply say they are polite and welcoming would be an understatement. Their kindness and warmth is electric. The art space loft was perfect. The linens smelled fresh, the space was inviting and clean, and the art showcased throughout the studio was done well. There is no television and we didn't miss it. Who needs television when you have all this art to enjoy? The studio has a very well working air conditioning unit and so many windows to open for fresh air if the weather permits. On our second night, our gracious hosts invited us into the home for homemade pie and ice cream and to chat and share travel stories. Incredible. I can't say enough great things about this Airbnb. I've used Airbnb about five times now and this is by far the best experience I've ever had. I literally can't think of one bad thing about this unit. Thank you to Mary Lou and Alan for a great Salem trip."
14077210,97448035,2016-08-27,31030511,Doug,"I have stayed in Airbnb's all over the world, from SF to Boston to London to Berlin to Waikiki.  Our experience with Mary Lou and Alan was unparalleled magic.  My wife and I are hesitant to let others know.  This is the best kept secret of Salem! "
14077210,97782645,2016-08-28,2553522,Val,"We could not possibly have had a more pleasant experience, in every way, than the one we had at Mary Lou's art loft. The well-designed and beautifully crafted space is a perfect accommodation. It's stocked with plenty of snacks, drinks, even toiletries. The fact that it is in a lovely, friendly neighborhood close to everything and filled with quality art is a tremendous bonus.  Mary Lou and Allen are delightful hosts, very friendly, knowledgeable, and responsive to our every need. Whatever you are doing in Salem, a stay at Mary Lou's art loft will enrich your experience! "
14077210,98799557,2016-09-01,28254397,David,"Mary Lou and her husband were a joy and we'll feel like we made new friends.  Showing me around your lovely city was above and beyond and I am so grateful.  The loft was secluded and romantic yet open, bright and a feast for the eyes.  We look forward to staying with you again soon!"
14077210,99114448,2016-09-03,58784808,Audrey,"The Art Loft had everything you could possibly need-snacks, toiletries, music- and was located in a very beautiful, quiet, and private setting.

14077210,99389188,2016-09-04,89227263,Austin,"Mary Lou was amazing! We arrived to fresh baked cookies, and were given a book full of local recommendations.  The house was perfect and they were lovely people! Thank you so much!"
14077210,100373886,2016-09-09,13320236,Larry,"This was a lovely place to stay in a beautiful neighborhood.  Our travel was delayed resulting in a very late arrival but Mary Lou and her husband were available and made sure we were comfortable.  A lot of small touches that really made traveling easier: a keurig for coffee; half & half in the refrigerator; etc.  The space was very clean, private, and well laid out.  We plan to return to have more time to explore the neighborhood."
14077210,100708389,2016-09-10,62065,Janet,"I loved my stay at this artistic and peaceful studio! Every detail was top notch, and the hosts are charming, welcoming and really have put a lot of care into creating a great space. I can't wait until my next opportunity to visit the ol' hometown!"
14077210,101305180,2016-09-12,41970,Mike,"Wow -- I'm a frequent AirBnB traveler and this is the best experience I've had yet in an AirBnB. <br/><br/>The host is absolutely accommodating and thoughtful. We had coffee, snacks, water, tea, bagels, yogurt set up for us. We arrived very late after a day spent with friends in the valley -- and she didn't bat an eye. <br/><br/>The space is gorgeous, inspired, inspiring, and immaculate. The gallery aspect is so cool. The collection is stunning and creative b<br/><br/>I'm writing a book and am thinking returning to use the loft as my writing space. "
14077210,101503483,2016-09-13,38451073,Don,"This is a great place to stay, one of the nicest neighborhoods I'm aware of in Salem.<br/>Mary Lou went above and beyond to make sure my arrival and comfort level with their space was immediate.  Very nice people!"
14077210,102596062,2016-09-18,76747429,Rebecca,"Mary Lou and Alan were helpful in every way, from picking us up at the train station, offering great recommendations, baking us scones and even dropping off a picnic basket. The loft itself is beautiful, quiet, spacious, well appointed.  Note the bed is a full/double, so if you are used to more room it may be an adjustment.  We very much enjoyed our stay. "
14077210,104105973,2016-09-25,92903108,George," Mary Lou and her husband made me feel right at home. The accommodations were first class. I can't imagine a better experience than the one I had.  My hosts were kind, knowledgeable, and wonderful to be with. They gave me the space I needed to rest, and were there for me if I had questions. Stay here, you won't regret it!!"
14077210,104198012,2016-09-25,12705189,Rachel,"Mary Lou is a warm, generous and wonderful host. The loft is delightful in every way. The art work and overall lay out of the space are lovely.

14077210,104969555,2016-09-29,83978218,Jill,"What a place!!!  We didn't want to leave.  We wish we had been able to spend more time in this beautiful art loft.  Mary Lou and Alan couldn't have been nicer.  Homemade chocolate chip cookies upon arrival and a lovely bottle of wine left at our door to celebrate the beginning of our honeymoon.  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit with Mary Lou and Alan, hope to see them again.  Thank you for sharing your beautiful home."
14077210,106013855,2016-10-03,9729043,Barney,"If there were more stars available to describe our stay at the Artist's Loft, we'd grab them. Being surrounded by museum quality art is pure enchantment. The loft has every amenity with unexpected touches that surprised and delighted us. Hosts Mary Lou and Alan go the extra mile with exuberant suggestions(all spot on). They've taken the Airbandb experience to new heights for us. We hated to leave and can't wait to return."
14077210,106563512,2016-10-06,89522453,Sandy,"The hosts went above and beyond to be welcoming and personable and gracious. The loft was WONDERFUL! Comfortable and exactly what was described and needed! The visit was AMAZING,in all ways! "

14077210,110506278,2016-10-26,97410294,Stephanie,"This was my very first Airbnb experience and all I have to say is WOW! Mary Lou and Alan were warm, relaxed,and always available. The loft is bright, cheerful, whimsical  and very cleverly furnished and set up to provide efficient functionality. The personal touches and consideration  by Mary Lou were found in all the unexpected amentities that were provided...natural body wash, shampoo, q-tips, toothpaste, shaving cream, hair dryer, iron/ironing board, UMBRELLA, and I can't even remember what else. Kitchen was graciously stocked with fantastically fun plates,bowls, cutlery, toaster, coffee, tea, snacks, granola,fruit, variety of  1/2 and 1/2 and almond milk for the coffee, and a great bottle of Chardonnay! <br/>I didn't want to leave after 5 days of being in a safe,cozy, beautiful environment. Truly was a home away from home:)"
14077210,110812277,2016-10-28,34011874,Billy,This is a secret little place in Salem!  Everything was perfect.

A special and well appointed art space, with lots of unexpected and gracious extras (a welcoming bottle of wine, coffee, breakfast and snack items). No TV (a plus), easy off street parking, with a partial (no range/oven) kitchen. Exceptionally friendly and helpful hosts Matt Lou and Alan. Delightful."
14077210,115558471,2016-11-25,64815964,Timothy,"The entire experience was great!  You can tell Mary Lou put a lot of thought into how the unit is laid out and eclectically decorated, with plenty of info about all of the art and local artists and galleries.<br/><br/>The location is perfect.  Not far at all from the Salem city center, and easy access via Commercial to south Salem, or via Mission to the freeway."
14077210,116567786,2016-12-01,7780689,Stephanie,"I arrived to Salem late in the evening, but my hosts were ready and waiting to greet me and show me around. Mary Lou had even made cookies for my arrival! I also was able to meet their adorable dog, which was a highlight for me ;-).<br/><br/>The loft was extremely clean and the artwork was stunning and interesting. I wish I had a little more time to read up on a few pieces that spoke to me.<br/><br/>I require a heavy comforter to sleep comfortably, and they had one as an extra option on the bed. The mattress was extremely comfortable as well. <br/><br/>For breakfast, I had tea with honey, yogurt and granola, which was all right in the room. Very convienient and appreciated. <br/><br/>My only problem was that I had to scoot out early the next morning for work appointments, when all I really wanted to do was to stay in the loft and relax for the morning! <br/><br/>Thank you for such a lovely experience. "
14077210,120200996,2016-12-08,91355161,Margaret,Second time here - felt just like home! So so nice - I'll be back!
14077210,123115474,2016-12-27,105256094,Rebecca,"Our host was most charming actually getting my husband something he loves for breakfast.  Very nice.  <br/><br/>The description of the unit was accurate. It was a lovely artsy lift over the garage that was quite wonderful.   Being a painter myself, I often fell asleep admiring the art around us.  And the neighborhood was quite nice.  <br/><br/>Both hosts were very friendly and inviting. We would have loved to spend a little more time with them (as they suggested) but everyone was so busy with seeing family during the holidays that time ran out.     Great visit. "

There is plenty of space to lounge, the kitchenette is wonderful for fixing breakfast in the morning, and I really enjoyed being surrounded by all the art work.

14077210,132915904,2017-02-19,91016966,Sophie,"We loved our stay in Mary Lou's beautiful, bright loft. The bed was very comfortable, and we had a cozy morning enjoying the array of snacks and fruit provided for us and looking at all of the art included in the space. If we had had more time in town, we would have loved to take advantage of the complimentary passes to the Hallie Ford art museum that Mary Lou graciously provided. A wonderful find! "
14077210,135016734,2017-03-02,38712136,Jan,We loved our stay at this well equipped  art filled loft.  The historical location is the best in Salem.   Mary Lou and Allen's attention to detail was amazing and so helpful.  Even better than the description.  Looking forward to returning.

14077210,138439850,2017-03-19,31364878,Susan,"If i could give Mary Lou and Alans loft 100 stars i would. It is everything an airbnb should be. Clean comfortable homey, beautifully decorated, fully equipped right down to the coffee and cream (very impt) they are hosts that make you feel like so much more than a paying guest. They are all the reasons to stay in an airbnb rather than a hotel. It was a perfect stay. We will be back for sure! "
14077210,138965924,2017-03-22,10952700,Meghan,"Mary's place was so welcoming - clean, beautiful, full of art, and very comfortable. I had a wonderful stay at her loft and highly recommend it."

14077210,142334840,2017-04-07,16611610,Julie,"Mary Lou's loft is absolutely lovely!  I slept soundly and well there, and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  It was an unexpected benefit to get to walk in such a beautiful neighborhood, and also to run to and around Bush Park, which is very close!  I was warmly welcomed at Mary Lou's home.  It made me appreciate kindness, and remember that there are many good people in the world."
14077210,142950989,2017-04-09,95763659,Janice,Great location for downtown activities.  Quiet and clean.  Mary Lou and Alan were very welcoming and provided plenty of information on things to do and see while in Salem.  <br/><br/>Will stay there again when visiting Salem.

14077210,150400133,2017-05-07,127899515,David,"This was our first experience in an Air B and B. The reviews were excellent but did not prepare us totally. Our hosts were great and made our stay excellent. Many extra touches that enhanced our stay. Comfortable, cozy, private, and just perfect. Can't wait to stay again. "
14077210,151388687,2017-05-12,14731690,Annie,"Such a great experience at Mary Lou's loft. Mary Lou was a wonderful, warm host with great communication the entire time.<br/><br/>The space is lovely and very private. It felt like staying in a bright and airy tree house. And the art everywhere really adds to the place. Plus, most pieces are for sale, so you can bring a memory home with you.<br/><br/>Definitely will be back!"
14077210,152462140,2017-05-16,118282139,Donna,Mary Lou and Alan are great hosts and the Art Loft is a cozy comfortable place to stay. The location was perfect for us.

She even surprised us with little treats...beside all the comfort the studio gives you it definitely also inspires you! Just wonderful! We have to say a big big thank you and we'll definitely come again! "

14077210,159369453,2017-06-10,72393087,Amy,"Exceeded our expectations, perfection, highly recommend and will stay again. Host, Mary Lou, is very friendly and was quick to respond from initial communication and throughout our stay. The Art Loft is in a lovely historic neighborhood and is very quiet, we slept well. Our parking space was conveniently at the bottom of the stairs. We were very pleased with the Art Loft, the vibe, layout, size, decor and amenities, all were wonderful. Cleanliness was great, bed was very comfortable, bed and bath linens were good quality. The bathroom and kitchen were thoughtfully stocked. We enjoyed  our coffee, yogurt and granola, while sitting surrounded by all the wonderful art, reading about the artists / artwork and the host's local recommendations. We were in Salem for a relative's graduation. The Art Loft was our peaceful oasis. In between family celebrations we found time to visit Willamette Winery for a bite and a glass of wine. Archive Coffee Bar, a short drive away, was great. After a walk around downtown, we took a short drive to Minto Island Growers, for a delicious lunch, on the edge of the garden, prepared in a food truck type trailer, by friendly folks... We were thrilled with the suggestions in the Art Loft's notebook. Our son was also pleased with his special accommodations (""camp-out"") on the mattress and bedding provided and we could easily fold it all up and tuck it out of the way. Mary Lou even had some small toys and an artist board for our son. He loved borrowing these cool new toys. Mary Lou's husband is just as nice, we met him when dropping off the key. Our stay couldn't have been better and I highly recommend the Art Loft. We'll be back!"
14077210,160134719,2017-06-12,9455436,Court,This loft is a wonderful place to be. Mary Lou was a fantastic host and our experience was nothing short of perfect.
14077210,160834547,2017-06-15,134005326,David,"OK, so I'm a little reluctant to write an excellent review, because, well, I want the place to be available next time I'm in Salem. Selfish; I know.<br/><br/>SO, in the spirit of altruism: what a wonderful place to stay, and what incredibly good hosts. Off-street parking was convenient. The loft is private and spacious. And eclectic. I love art. If you do, this unique loft is a fun place to stay.<br/><br/>If that doesn't matter to you, well; I'm sorry. HOWEVER, you won't find a better hostess in Mary Lou, who is there to accommodate. She has a true, caring spirit, and wants you to enjoy your stay.<br/><br/>For business, the location was perfect for me: close to brew pubs AND my meeting location; featuring decent (though not blinding) WiFi speeds -- while quiet and comfortable. If the pictures of the place entice you, don't think twice. Mary Lou, I hope I have an opportunity to come back. Thanks!"
14077210,161371876,2017-06-17,109923234,Doris,Thank you.
14077210,161841265,2017-06-18,130083237,Joel,We loved Mary Lou's place.  We will be back and tell our friends and family about this great hide away
14077210,162416735,2017-06-20,130083237,Joel,Mary Lou's place was beautiful.  They welcomed us warmly and we had an instant connection.   We loved looking at the artwork in the loft space.  When can you just sit and appreciate art?  Mary Lou thought of everything from fresh scones to breakfast treats.  We will be back!
14077210,163169109,2017-06-23,127072913,Stephanie,"Really great place. The best thing about the place was the treehouse effect, a lot of windows, a lot of light, and looking at the light on the trees. The decor in the studio showed a level of sophistication I haven't seen in (stodgy) Salem.  I felt a little touch of Manhattan about it. Great fridge, the freezer is separate compartment so frozen food stays frozen. (I must admit to gobbling up some ice cream and herb cream cheese left in there.)<br/>Mary Lou went out of her way to explain everything and to be communicative when she wasn't there.  She was a good hostess. Treat yourself to this studio on Fairmont Hill.  It's unique in Salem and better than the Grand Hotel."
14077210,166189687,2017-07-02,130749840,Melissa,"We were looking for a centrally located place to stay while we were in town for a friend's wedding last weekend.  After comparing this to the prices/amenities for area hotels, it was a no-brainer to pick Mary Lou's airbnb.  The loft is gorgeous, light-filled, and beautifully appointed with art from local artists.  Mary Lou, Alan, and Gramps are excellent, warm, and welcoming hosts who truly understand the meaning of hospitality--from restaurant recommendations, to the complimentary snacks and bottle of wine that greeted us upon arrival, to the conversation we shared while relaxing on the back patio--their accommodations were some of the best we've experienced."
14077210,166559868,2017-07-03,68407060,Zak,Great place very visually appealing and the hosts are beyond accommodating
14077210,167742802,2017-07-07,73451443,James,Mary Lou and Alan's art loft was delightful--beautifully decorated with original art and conveniently located within a short drive of Salem's downtown restaurants and bars. They had lots of great recommendations as well. 
14077210,168595187,2017-07-09,14818123,Brian,"Nice small studio, Mary Lou provides snacks, granola, and coffee to allow for quiet mornings. I would stay here again. "
14077210,170502208,2017-07-15,74183808,Holly,"Fabulous first experience with AirBNB--  the location is walking or an UBER distance to the capitol, downtown shopping, Willamette or the Salem Hospital.  Private parking right at the steps of the loft. The hosts are the perfect balance of charming and non-intrusive. The Art Loft is tasteful, pristine (not for dirty boots ) and an end of day oasis! "
14077210,172065902,2017-07-19,21108904,Amanda,"My husband and I had our BEST AirBnB experience staying with Mary Lou and Alan! The loft was clean, comfortable, airy, and had everything we needed. Mary Lou left us little snacks, which were especially helpful for our day trip hiking. The bed was very comfortable so had restful sleep the entire time. While the loft is equipped with AC, it was breezy with the window open so we just slept with the fan on. The artwork throughout the loft and sculptures in the garden kept it colorful and fun! <br/><br/>The neighborhood was a beautiful and quiet residential neighborhood with friendly neighbors. Walking distance to a big park (Busch Park) for a morning run or stroll. Also under 10 minutes drive to downtown Salem. We found the loft location very convenient for driving to nearby towns (e.g., Dayton, Mcminneville, Newburg, Dundee) and vineyards - all about 30-45 minutes drive away. <br/><br/>The highlight of our stay was getting to know Mary Lou, Alan, and their adorable dog, Gramps. We had a great time chatting with them each day and enjoyed the tour they gave us of the neighborhood. They gave us tips for places to check out and were so warm and thoughtful - I wish they were our neighbors back home! <br/><br/>Mary Lou, Alan, and Gramps - thanks again for an awesome stay and please do keep in touch!!"
14077210,175371234,2017-07-28,4139006,Gee & Emily,"This property is AMAZING. The listing and pictures don't do it justice. We wanted to stay so much longer. Beautiful property, neighborhood and hosts. Lots of amenities including snacks, tons of towels, and recommendations for local hot spots. Don't pass this place up!"
14077210,176337220,2017-07-30,55814428,Michelle,"This review echoes the previous glowing reviews! Comfortable, quiet, clean, thoughtfully put-together. Tucked away in a beautiful, peaceful neighborhood with easy access to both downtown dining and scenic wine country. I'm so delighted we opted for Mary Lou and Alan's place over a local hotel. Wonderful hospitality and very warm welcome. They have a knack for hosting!"
14077210,176797772,2017-07-31,23987675,Andrew,"We really enjoyed Mary Lou's art loft in Salem. It is so unique and charming... also very clean and comfortable with plenty of space for 2 adults. They live in a beautiful area of town, perfect for a leisurely stroll or a jog. We enjoyed chatting with Mary Lou and Allen in their lovely patio and garden area. They are very friendly, interesting, and genuine people, and we would no doubt stay here again if traveling through Salem."
14077210,177440057,2017-08-02,30461102,Jeffrey,"Exactly as described, we received such a warm welcome from Mary Lou (and Gramps). Would absolutely visit again!"

14077210,179138713,2017-08-06,45677245,Gordon,"This was a real find. Mary Lou and Alan were terrific hosts, and theirs is a beautiful and peaceful property south of downtown Salem in a wonderful and quiet residential area. The loft was very private and comfortable. I slept better than in any of my business trips to Salem in a long time. The kitchenette with a small fridge, microwave, and Keurig was perfect. Very easy to relax here after a busy day...just what I needed!"
14077210,179909547,2017-08-08,52409594,Cody,Great Place!!!

14077210,182013922,2017-08-13,94203719,Tyler,Mary Lou is an amazing host.  They have a beautiful place to stay and in a beautiful safe neighborhood.  I would recommend to stay here to anyone.

First, the neighborhood is gorgeous with stunning houses and mature trees and lush landscaping.  Its quiet and simply serene.  Second, Mary Lou and Alan are consummate hosts.  They were communicative, super friendly and make you feel right at home.  Finally, the guest house is a special place decorated with gorgeous artwork and all sorts of things to make a guest comfortable.  It's a spacious loft with views of the surrounding trees, windows everywhere and tons of light.  It's quiet and relaxing.  You just unwind by spending time in the loft.  There's a kitchenette that they have stocked thoughtfully with all sorts of delicious treats.  I particularly loved the reclaimed wood floor made from a racquet ball court.  An utterly delightful place to stay.  I highly recommend it!"
14077210,183601785,2017-08-17,51950144,Amara,"Lovely art loft ~ really wonderful space & Salem experience. Alan & Mary Lou go out of their way to make this a great experience; providing location suggestions, access to local art, & even having some local magazines out. Additionally, they were wonderful hosts willing to help in a timely and efficient manner. Hope to stay with them again."
14077210,183970642,2017-08-18,4037795,Jackie,Really beautiful situation with a lake and activities to enjoy. We weren't able to stay very long but had a good nights sleep and a peaceful morning while watching the deer.

14077210,185098626,2017-08-20,117058376,Sophia,"My boyfriend and I had the most amazing stay at the Zeek's residence. Starting with excellent communication, a tour of their beautiful loft and home for us, we've enjoyed every moment and even came back for a welcomed invitation to see the Solar Eclipse. We traveled from California but the Zeeks made Salem truly feel like home. Expect great recommendations of delicious restaurants, a artsy loft that will wow you, a warm and lovely neighborhood, and the company of excellent hosts. If we ever find ourselves back in Salem we will be back, truly genuine people."
14077210,185864354,2017-08-22,30016433,Joe,"This was our second visit to the Art Loft with Mary Lou and Alan. We went this year to view the eclipse and we're invited to a pancake block party to celebrate TOTALITY.  <br/>This location is fantastic for everyone. Extremely clean. Your own private parking space. Soft bed. Comfortable sheets. A fantastic sofa to read, relax, and look at the art adorning the walls. The sliding art walls move to display a swivel television and a fantastic kitchenette. Air conditioner works great, but we found sleeping with the fan and open windows were sufficient. Within walking distance to downtown and our favorite taproom, Venti, which is only a few miles from the loft. The Art Loft is the  perfect space for you to unwind and chill. Thank you again, Mary Lou & Alan, you are one in a billion."
14077210,187262016,2017-08-26,14683850,Suzi,Lovely art filled space. Comfy and peaceful.  Mary Lou and Alan are wonderful hosts. The garden was filled with whimsy....my favorite! <br/>Thank you for everything and the yummy scones! <br/><br/>Hope to see you soon! <br/><br/>Todd and Suzan

It is such a unique place and we loved being surrounded by phenomenal art. They even had a notebook where you could read about the artists as well as helpful recommendations for places to eat and visit around the area. Mary Lou and Alan were just fantastic and so sweet and accommodating. We felt so welcomed. We would definitely come back to stay here the next time we are in Salem. So lovely!

14077210,214337158,2017-11-25,98809405,Susan,Absolutely LOVE Mary Lou and Alans place. Our second visit and the only place to stay when in Salem  Everything you have read by previous guests is true. They are wonderful hosts and the space is beautiful!!
14077210,215427632,2017-11-29,48273122,Shauna,"I was obsessed with this space. It was clean, had everything needed... the neighborhood was quiet and beautiful. Mary Lou and Alan were so friendly and welcoming... I literally wish I could live in this loft. I hope to be able to stay here again in the future! Perfect!"
14077210,217539166,2017-12-09,77944675,Justin,What a perfect space for us! Wouldn’t have done anything different. Mary Lou and her Husband were very welcoming and the loft was so beautifully put together. Nice touches throughout that make it just that much better.
14077210,218434323,2017-12-12,18468232,Alyssa,"Mary Lou’s place is so cute, comfortable, and in a great quiet neighborhood. I was able to get a nice meal at the local organic grocery store up the road and in the morning there was coffee and yummy granola in the kitchen that let me stay in and relax before I had to begin my day working. This studio of art was very fun and relaxing environment and the bed was comfy too!"
14077210,218589210,2017-12-13,87818880,Chris,"I love staying in Airbnbs and this is definitely one of the best!  It is as beautiful as the oictures and has everything you might need or want.   The bed was really comfortable and  There was a desk where I could work and a well stocked kitchenette with snacks, coffee, fresh fruit and breakfast items.  It was very quiet and parking was easy.  Mary Lou and Alan were gracious hosts and made everything easy.  The neighborhood is quiet but was close to everything I needed in downtown Salem.  I've already made a reservation for another stay next monthand hope to always be able to stay here when I'm visiting Salem!"
14077210,219525963,2017-12-17,119834800,Diane,Quiet loft with amazing art everywhere.  Comfortable and just the spot for a couple or single to settle in for a  cozy stay.
14077210,220760362,2017-12-23,36877764,Howard,We loved Mary lou’s Place in all respects
14077210,221525188,2017-12-26,915500,Cecilia,"This is a beautiful loft and the hosts created special touches for the stay including a bottle of wine for the guests, breakfast food, and beautiful art on the walls. As an example of the hosts' attention to detail, they include a fan in the room in case a guest would like white noise in the background as they sleep. I appreciated that the hosts were also fine with me having my sister stay with me throughout my stay. The only thing that could be improved is the wifi - it was spotty in various places in the loft. I imagine this is because the loft is streaming from the house. That said, the still worked fairly well and the art on the walls and beauty of the loft itself made up for spotty wifi. I'd highly recommend this spot to other folks."
14077210,222047265,2017-12-28,2216652,Audrey,Allan and Mary Lou were the best hosts! Parking space right next to the unit. Check in was easy and smooth and Allan pointed out everything we needed to know about the apartment and the area which was helpful for us to find places to eat. The apartment itself was super clean and stylish with the beautiful artwork surrounding us. Everything in the apartment was easy to find and self explanatory to use. We will definitely stay here again.
14077210,222819240,2017-12-30,1020122,Justin,Mary Lou's stylist studio was an amazing place to stay. I would recommend anyone visiting the area to try and stay here
14077210,223775897,2018-01-01,69245642,Patricia,A beautiful comfortable private place to stay close to downtown Salem. Hosted by a great couple. There are not enough words to describe the charm of this place so stop looking and just book it!
14077210,225191131,2018-01-05,34924059,Evan,"Fantastic hospitality from these hosts, the space was well designed and included lots of appreciated amenities."
14077210,226628576,2018-01-11,18468232,Alyssa,Another amazing stay at Mary Lou’s place. I am able to bring my own food to prep or go to the local organic grocery store up the road. The bed was extra cozy with winter blankets and sheets. I love staying here!!
14077210,227713721,2018-01-15,23291542,Lore,"Mary Lou and Allan are excellent hosts. Their space is stylish and clean, with adjacent parking.  The artwork is amazing!"
14077210,228426276,2018-01-19,659017,Daniel,"Mary Lou was wonderfully hospitable and warm. The place was comfortable, cozy, inviting, and so much more interesting than boring business hotels! It was a lovely respite after busy workdays."
14077210,229629633,2018-01-24,87818880,Chris,"Mary Lou and Alan are wonderful hosts and their place is beautiful and very comfortable.  This time there were cozy flannel sheets on the bed and fresh raisin English muffins and fruit waiting for breakfast.  Of all the Airbnb places I've stayed, this is, by far, my favorite.  The bed is comfortable and there is a nice desk and sitting area in addition to a well stocked kitchenette. I'm looking forward to my next stay here when I'm in Salem.  "
14077210,231754654,2018-02-02,39479634,Kenneth,"Super host, great communication, awesome artsy abode, and a comfortable bed in a quiet residential neighborhood. I didn’t stay long enough to enjoy it all but I will be back."
14077210,233248433,2018-02-08,146463423,Jim,"Bottom line is a lot of the airbnb experience is the hosts, and Mary Lou and Alan are the best. They made themselves available anytime we might need them, but also allowed us as much privacy as we wanted. They've taken a lot of time to make the loft unique, and it certainly was. If we travel again to Salem and need to be in the particular area, this place will be the first on our list."
14077210,235725448,2018-02-17,112186085,Sylvia,"Great spot! Nice natural light, beautiful artwork and loved the granola yogurt breakfast and coffee!<br/>Enjoyed walking in the neighborhood."
14077210,236668447,2018-02-19,67635447,Sarah,The art loft was incredible! We were visiting to compete at a local running race and could not have asked for a better place to stay. Mary Lou was a welcoming and responsive host and was willing to let us check in early.
14077210,237149499,2018-02-21,11656344,Regina,"As always, another good stay at the artist's loft in what turned out to be one of the coldest couple of days I've experienced in Salem. All was cozy and warm, however, and the atmosphere more than made up for the weather!"
14077210,238770043,2018-02-26,172260120,Kristin,This space is absolutely incredible!  Comfy and cozy and everything that you could ever need - every detail covered.  Would highly recommend.
14077210,242709798,2018-03-12,46040771,Alicia,"The art loft was in the perfect location for my quick stay in Salem. Mary Lou was so helpful and kind, and communicated well. The space is gorgeous too!"
14077210,245284573,2018-03-21,138452908,Karen,"Mary Lou's place is truly amazing. Adorned with amazing art from local artists, and stylishly furnished. The bed was cozy and comfortable and I slept like a baby, ensconced in cozy sheets and fluffy bedding. Mary Lou is a wonderful host and has a flare for creating an inviting environment. I hope to be able to stay again!!"
14077210,246085466,2018-03-24,18011936,Jody,"Mary Lou and Allen were both delightful and extremely artistic, which reflected in their beautiful apartment. The design and colors were very enjoyable, the communication with Mary Lou was prompt and concise, and her/their attention to details was beyond what I expected. I would recommend staying at their apartment, particularly if you desire a lovely, quiet location near downtown Salem and a stay that is free from stress or concerns."
14077210,246966029,2018-03-26,36729501,Christine,"We enjoyed the inspiring, art filled space and the beautiful neighborhood. Mary Lou was a wonderful, helpful host who provided delicious breakfast food, coffee pods and local magazines."
14077210,249152740,2018-04-01,62065,Janet,Another stellar stay at the Art Loft!
14077210,250622162,2018-04-05,180356031,Sherry,"The Artist’s Loft is gorgeous space in a lovely neighborhood, and the property has an amazing, beautiful garden.   Everything we needed was provided and much more! It was very comfortable, and the hosts made sure that we were well taken care of. The many extra touches like wine and chocolate treats made us feel welcomed and they were much appreciated.   We hope to have the opportunity to visit again soon.  It is a very special place."
14077210,250942247,2018-04-06,176660793,Teresa,"What an amazing find! Mary Lou and Alan are genuinely warm hosts. If you love art and creativity, you will absolutely love this place. The backyard is beautifully landscaped with a sprinkling of fun, eclectic art. Besides lovely hosts and wonderful art, you will have a comfortable bed and a very clean place. Unfortunately, this was a very rushed trip so we didn’t have nearly enough time to enjoy this beautiful, artsy space. We plan to book here our next trip!"
14077210,252942926,2018-04-12,40405659,Charity,"Amazing space, with great light, close to everything I needed."

14077210,254933988,2018-04-18,181703523,Sara,"This is a beautiful space, with original artwork and lots of windows to let in the sun. It is very comfortably appointed, and the hosts went above and beyond by providing excellent coffee, granola, yogurt and snacks. We hung out for hours in this lovely space, reading and relaxing in the rain. Lots to do in Salem and surrounding country as well, Silver Falls state park was especially nice."
14077210,259304131,2018-05-01,6590535,Rosemary,"This place was all the things that make AirBNB superior to hotels: gracious hosts interested in meeting new people, unique accommodations, privacy, gorgeous setting, delicious breakfast and snacks and great value. The spring flowers were in bloom and put on a magnificent show. The art was lovely and there was a binder where the artist explains their approach which I found helpful. One of the best places we have stayed with AirBNB."
14077210,262413703,2018-05-08,38115761,Mary Beth,"Mary Lou and Alan greeted and welcomed us.  They steered us too.  Their Art Loft is a unique treat in every way.  Don’t miss it! <br/><br/>As a lover of beautiful things, this loft will sweep you in.  We stayed two nights and were still admiring/noticing new touches.  ML & A are a terrific team - she’s an artist and he’s an articulate carpenter/builder/teacher.  <br/><br/>If we lived near, we’d probably be friends.<br/><br/>Cheers to this beautiful area from the East Coast!!!<br/><br/><br/>Enjoy,<br/><br/>MB & Allan"
14077210,264385292,2018-05-13,2357382,Ross,Mary Lou was such a great host!  She made sure that we had all the details we needed when traveling to the house and she had tons of information about local sights. <br/><br/>The space is clean and very fun. We would definitely stay here again.
14077210,264807206,2018-05-14,22867449,Mollie,"Mary Lou’s space was stunning, so cozy and interesting. We loved all the local art work in the studio and in the back yard. Mary Lou recommended a restaurant that was a highlight of our fast work trip with awesome tea and vegetarian options. This place was beautiful and we wish we could have stayed longer. The neighborhood was also beautiful and we enjoyed an evening stroll to downtown and watching the sunset!"
14077210,265615769,2018-05-17,7099123,Meagan,"Comfortable, clean, delicious snacks available. On demand cable and roku. Nice neighborhood, quiet. Excellent hosts. Would easily stay here again."

14077210,270211371,2018-05-28,1532517,Jennifer,Mary Lou and Allen are the BEST! Mary Lou helped me before we arrived with info about Salem. <br/>Check in was great and very welcoming. <br/>The loft is very comfortable and the kitchen was stocked with coffee and breakfast.<br/>We really enjoyed our stay in Salem and can't wait to be back soon.
14077210,270636180,2018-05-29,20415091,Mariann,"A beautiful and unique space. We loved all the artwork and special touches. Even though it is a studio apartment, it felt spacious and roomy for two people, even when we spent the morning working there. It is in a beautiful neighborhood and close to great restaurants and coffee shops."
14077210,271245349,2018-05-31,63544213,Molly,"We loved staying here, would definitely stay here again. Mary Lou and Alan were excellent hosts. "
14077210,274287731,2018-06-08,2180240,Jason,Mary Lou and Alan are excellent hosts. Wish we could have stayed longer
14077210,275307694,2018-06-10,61449922,Suzanne,This place does not disappoint!   It's really a neat space.   Decor is superb.    Amenities were well thought out.  We had great communication with our host.  Very comfortable space.   Loved being in a neighborhood yet close to everything.   Quiet.  Our host thought of everything.  Easy to communicate with.   I give this place space five out of five stars!   Highly recommend.
14077210,276429907,2018-06-13,130289605,Cheryl,"The space was wonderful -- felt like being in a tree house with stunning art everywhere.  Lovely part of Salem.  We enjoyed exploring Salem and the surrounding areas, following tips from our wonderful hosts.  Would highly recommend."
14077210,277160884,2018-06-15,174115231,Thomas,A definite must should you need a place to stay while in Salem.
14077210,278297151,2018-06-17,8307758,Cate,"Do not pass up an opportunity to stay in Mary Lou's loft. The space is filled with inspring art, and the thoughtful touches of breakfast snacks for the morning, the clean and comfortable environment made for a restful stay.  I highly recommend this host and would gladly stay again."
14077210,278753203,2018-06-18,3245578,Beth,"Mary Lou and Alan are exceptional hosts! Their home is outstanding. It’s close to downtown yet hidden in this gorgeous neighborhood. The house is located in back of the property. It almost feels like staying in a treehouse but a very luxurious and tastefully decorated one! So many little touches such as coffee with cream and sugar, granola, yogurt and snacks. They both gave us wonderful suggestions on places to go and bings to do. We absolutely loved our stay!"
14077210,281311359,2018-06-24,181065214,Lori,"Staying at Mary Lou’s was fantastic.  The loft was decorated with some amazing pieces of art and its layout was perfect.  After each day’s adventures, it was so relaxing to come back and catch our breath.  And it wasn’t just the loft, it was the entire neighborhood.  Downstairs from the loft, there was a cozy outdoor “room” with a firepit, were we could sit and have a drink and go through the pictures of the day.  Art was everywhere, from paintings to statues to mobiles….it was so comfortable and welcoming.  Even looking out the windows, everyone in the area had these beautiful gardens and landscapes to brighten everything up.  We were surrounded by gardens full of everything from roses to wildflowers.  Every night, after coming back from our adventures, we would take time to simply walk around the block.  The entire neighborhood had lots of little corner gardens with mixes of full blooms or bushes of blueberries and blackberries, huge trees, hidden pathways…. the neighborhood itself was almost a huge public park, where a walk down the sidewalk was one picture perfect setting after another.  <br/>Mary Lou is a fantastic host.  She made sure we had coffee, snacks, sundries, and every other little thing that made the experience so wonderful.  And if that wasn’t enough, on our last day, as we were packing our car to head out, she came out to say goodbye and give us a bag full of chocolate chip cookies she had made the night before.  <br/><br/>I highly recommend if you are visiting Salem, check out Mary Lou’s wonderful place.  It was a perfect launchpad for our visit to Oregon (where we travelled from the Coast to Silver Falls State Park to the Downtown Salem Saturday Farmers Market) with truly gracious hosts."
14077210,286659833,2018-07-06,6511701,Laura,"We had high hopes, but it was truly even better than I had expected. It was such a unique and interesting space-- something I always look for in an AirBnB. And nothing was sacrificed in terms of amenities and conveniences. We had our own separate parking area right at the loft. The way that the space fully functions as an art gallery and a comfortable living space, using these cool sliding walls, reminds me of some of the grand finales of those home makeover shows. It's just fun. <br/>Mary Lou couldn't be a warmer host. And one night she and her husband happened to be having marionberry pie-- an Oregon specialty that we had never heard of. She warmed up two pieces and brought it over to us. We are not particularly fond of pies in general, but I'm telling you that this was the most amazing pie we had ever had. Not only that, but it introduced us to a cool local Oregon fruit that we wouldn't have gotten in any other state, but would likely have missed out on if not for Mary Lou! <br/>The neighborhood is so beautiful-- every house different and so cool-looking. And located just a a few minutes from Willamette University. <br/>I couldn't recommend more highly!"
14077210,288401640,2018-07-09,64542254,Wendy,"We loved this space!  Mary Lou and Alan were great hosts - incredibly welcoming, communicative, and hospitable.  <br/><br/>The space feels like you're staying in an art gallery and the windows provide excellent morning light.  We kept the windows open at night which was the perfect temperature.  <br/><br/>The town of Salem was really fun.  We only stayed for one night, but would love to be back someday!"
14077210,288800708,2018-07-10,11277285,Kevin,"Such a great stay! Located in a quiet & lovely neighborhood just a few minutes from all the restaurants, we enjoyed our short stop in Salem. Mary Lou and Alan were excellent hosts and very accommodating. We would definitely stay again!"
14077210,289628719,2018-07-12,18468232,Alyssa,"Mary Lou’s place is my favorite place to stay in Salem. Great views, cute neighborhood, close to restaurants, and she has coffee, yogurt and granola stocked in the kitchen. The little art studio is comfortable and quiet. I always look for her place first!"
14077210,290090407,2018-07-13,23470278,Brent,"Mary Lou was a great host!  She's put so much thought into her lovely space. It's beautiful, and just what i needed for my short stay.  "

14077210,293174409,2018-07-19,56929388,Angie,"Mary Lou’s place was exceptional and exceeded our expectations. What a fun place with all of amenities and more. We especially enjoyed the art! The neighborhood was beautiful, peaceful, and close to activities. Our only regret is not being to stay longer! Her place comes highly recommended! "
14077210,295597849,2018-07-23,130167528,Michael,"We’d love to keep this wonderful spot a secret but it’s not fair to other travelers. <br/><br/>We have made a second visit and hope for more. This loft is perfect, cozy and filled with artistic charm. The hosts always look for ways to welcome and spoil their guests with little extras in the frig, wine, coffee and essentials that are well stocked and available. <br/><br/>One of our very best and favorite air b&b experiences. But shhhhhh, don’t tell everyone. "
14077210,295966827,2018-07-24,85900039,Bruce,The very special opportunity to spend our evening in Mary Lou's art gallery made for a unique and joyful experience during our one-night stay in Salem. We highly recommend.

14077210,297384415,2018-07-27,77552644,Stephanie,"This is the best Air BnB I've ever stayed in. It was beautiful (used to be an art gallery!) and so thoughtfully prepared - Mary Lou left out detailed lists of recommended restaurants and things to do in Salem (including a free pass to a local art museum), snacks, and everything. Definitely check out the restaurants, they were So Good. There was also a cute little logbook where guests could leave notes and drawings for future guests to read. The loft was spotlessly clean, private, and air conditioned! The bed was comfy, there was a TV with Netflix, wifi, and extra of anything we might need. And to top it all off, Mary Lou and her husband were the nicest people ever! 10/10 would recommend staying here, it was the highlight of our trip."
14077210,298853137,2018-07-29,15697913,Jim,"Tremendously unique art loft in a prime location of Salem Oregon. Mary Lou is a wonderful hostess, and maintains a clean and orderly Art filled unit. I’m sure will use it again in the future. Jim and Brooks "
14077210,299833665,2018-07-31,29515974,Michelle,"This Airbnb is the best I’ve ever stayed in.  Bed is super comfy, bathroom was small but perfect for my needs with great amenities. The space is light and filled with art but also easy to make dark for slumber.  The design of the loft with moveable panels was SO COOl! Coffee, creamer, granola, tea, yogurt!! And the hosts are just the nicest people ever! I hope to stay again on my next work trip to Salem!!"
14077210,300690015,2018-08-02,198880995,Sally,This space is very unique and comfortable. The location is close to downtown and many amenities. It was a great choice for us while visiting family in the area.
14077210,303162447,2018-08-06,3053884,Jane,"A comfortable, restful, peaceful space. Extremely comfortable bed. It is convenient to downtown and an easy place to stay for business, but I hope to be able to come back sometime when I have more time to just enjoy relaxing there. Very friendly hosts with prompt clear communication. Highly recommended."
14077210,305050858,2018-08-10,200950004,Hope,Mary Lou and Alan were very friendly  and I'm glad we chose them as hosts! The place was very clean and exceeded expectations.
14077210,306602675,2018-08-12,368873,Jon,Great hosts. Very private light and art filled loft. About the best Airbandb I have rented. Has own parking space next to unit.
14077210,308095002,2018-08-15,196020846,Judy,"We found our stay in this beautiful art loft to be magical!  It is everything you see in the pictures and more!  It is equipped with everything you need and even things you didn’t know you needed...like a picnic basket fully stocked with paper products  just waiting to be filled with your favorite picnic foods.  I cannot begin to express just how enchanting and inviting their backyard is...the perfect place to sit and unwind at the end of the day and chill with a glass of wine from one of the local vineyards.  Hosts, Mary Lou and Alan are so genuine and gracious...we enjoyed sitting and chatting about Oregon with them.  The neighborhood is absolutely perfect for morning or evening strolls...such beautiful houses and yards.  The hosts, the loft, the art, the yard, the surrounding neighborhood...perfection!"
14077210,312541720,2018-08-23,58612461,Amy,Beautiful loft in a magical yard that Mary Lou and Alan graciously share with you and whimsical statues:). Thoughtful touches and very user friendly kitchenette set up.

They were great hosts as well; available and discrete.  There were extra touches: yogurt, granola, coffee, milk and choice of sweeteners. There were also toiletries for emergencies or items forgotten at home. We will be back!"
14077210,315404793,2018-08-28,410030,Sally,"Everything was lovely. This was my second stay, and I'm sure there will be a third."

14077210,321589887,2018-09-10,190133683,Anne,"I stayed here for five nights.  Nights: quiet, soft bed and linens, lovely breezes from well-placed windows.  Mornings: soft light, art-filled walls, wood floors, immaculate little kitchen with coffee and scones, compliments of Mary Lou and Alan. I think I may have dreamed of a loft just like this one.  I walked in through the french doors and all my cares just melted away.  Stay here whenever you can."

14077210,326212746,2018-09-21,144816882,Alex,"What you see in the photographs is just a hint of just how stunning this unique loft is. Wake up surrounded by beautiful artwork in you own private gallery.  Not only is it pleasing on the eye ,<br/>but practical as well. Sliding panels mean that you can move the canvas on display to reveal a fully functional, well stocked kitchenette. Loads of local information on file too."

14077210,342485829,2018-10-28,188621858,Stanley,Our daughter goes to Willamette in Salem and in the past we have stayed in one of the few hotels Salem offers.  Never again. The loft exceeded our expectations and was less expensive than most hotel rooms in the area. It is well appointed and comfortable.  The bedding was incredibly comfortable and the loft is filled with beautiful paintings. We found ourselves admiring the art often (it feels like a quaint gallery).  The loft sits above their detached garage and is accessible from the alley behind their main house.  It is private yet you have the benefit of having access to the beautiful backyard.  This will be our go to place until our daughter graduates and we will certainly tell other parents about it.
14077210,345352487,2018-11-04,28992921,Robert,"This place books fast! I highly recommend Mary Lou's guest suite, she's thought of everything!"

14077210,348908926,2018-11-15,12937514,Dave,"This marvelous place is like having your own private overnight in an art gallery.  Indeed it doubles as one, but the personal comforts abound to at once give it a very comfortable homey feel. I highly recommend."
14077210,350888188,2018-11-20,217959148,Susan,The loft was exactly as depicted with ample room for 2 and lots of bright outside light.  Mary Lou offered many tips for meals and walking.  We were within a 5  minute drive to restaurants.  Our stay was lovely.
14077210,351726535,2018-11-23,185775881,Rosemarie,"When we checked in, Mary Lou gave us a very informative tour.  We really thought it was great.  The dishes were all handmade and so stylish.  There were free family passes to a local museum, to name a few things.  <br/><br/>This art loft is a beautiful compilation of art and style.  The personality of this space is so unique!  We loved looking at all the art work.  The magazines and books were fun!  We had coffee, yogurt, granola and snacks which were so appreciated.  <br/><br/>I really loved the quick responses and all the communication.  It was so helpful.  This place is definitely worth the stay."

The loft is a gem and has everything you'd ever need, complete with snacks, coffee, tea, extra toiletry items, books, drawing pads and pencils, tv, radio, and a nice view. Her local recommendations for restaurants were spot on and her place is so conveniently located to every store we needed to go. Highly recommend!"
14077210,414141444,2019-02-18,104467724,Steve,2nd time here and had a great stay again!

It’s also just a hop, skip, and a jump from downtown which made is very convenient for my work trip.  Mary Lou and Alan could not have been nicer - they are wonderful hosts.  The bed is uber comfortable and I will definitely look to stay here again if I’m back in the area."
14077210,430085882,2019-03-29,181703523,Sara,"This is a lovely little hideaway in a beautiful neighborhood in Salem.  Mary Lou provides thoughtful touches like fresh flowers, delicious snacks and drinks, comfortable bedding, hints for exploring Salem and surrounding areas, and all the dishes, glassware, etc. you need to serve simple meals.  The loft is superbly furnished, and beautiful works of art decorate the space.  This was our second stay, and we were just as happy with it as the first time."
14077210,443816137,2019-04-26,28369674,Ramond,"I’m starting this review on my first day arriving for a 5 day stay because I already know I’m going to have a lot to say, and I don’t want to write a rushed review. I arrived on Easter Sunday. Mary Lou let me check in 2 hours before check in, even though they were totally doing family Easter in the main house. She walked me through the BEAUTIFUL garden to the guest house, and made sure I had everything I needed (including a plate of Easter Sunday lunch <3). I spent the next two hours walking around the neighborhood. I cannot express in words how gorgeous the neighborhood is. I took MANY photos :) I finished the evening on my personal patio, which conveniently sits perfectly in the sun all afternoon until practically sunset. Prefer the shade in the afternoon? Don’t worry, the garden bellow is filled with beautiful shrubs and flowers and comfortable seating. Not to mention the welded metal sculptures and other charming original pieces of art perfectly scatter throughout the foliage. Needless to say, I ended my first night in absolute heaven. <br/><br/>The following days were more of the same. Mary Lou periodically checked on me to ensure I was comfortable and had everything I needed. As days passed, I discovered more tasteful and entertaining special touches. For example, I loved the small jar of color pencils and hardback sketch book for guests to fill with notes and sketches. Of course, I also took many more walks around the neighborhood and neighboring parks (yes multiple. And they’re ALL beautiful). <br/><br/>The apartment was stocked with complimentary snacks and breakfast items. Coffee and tea were also provided. I know this is going to sound strange...but the soap and shampoo was sooooooo nice. The bathroom is also stocked with soft fluffy towels and an array of personal hygiene items. This requires a great deal of attention to detail, but it makes a WORLD of a difference. <br/><br/>I could go on and on about how perfect this experience was for me, but I think I’ve made my point. Stop looking. Book this space. It’s comfortable, beautiful, and unforgettable. <3"
14077210,483758001,2019-07-07,17045496,Scott,Great space and a tremendously accommodating host. Worth a stay even you don’t want to go to Salem

14077210,514150401,2019-08-20,9123809,Lillie,"I reserved this Airbnb for my bestie’s parents and they had SUCH a lovely stay there. They said it was clean and interesting and they loved the patio. They also loved the value. The best compliment, I think, is that they told me I should put my own family up there when they come visit. I will absolutely keep that in mind! Thank you, Mary Lou!"

Good location and she is very quick with responses to questions. I’ll be back. I was helping my son move into his apartment and wasn’t able to spend much time at the Airbnb but I would have liked to.

The neighborhood is lovely and so much fun for a morning walk if you enjoy architecture and great gardens! The loft itself was the perfect size for a couple - tons of natural light and all the amenities you could hope for. Our hostess was also amazing - she showed us around the place and also put together a picnic basket for us as we wandered around the local wineries. I would absolutely stay here again if we visit the area.

It felt clean, welcoming, peaceful, and private. I felt at home there - in an intangible way that I’m finding difficult to articulate.

We loved relaxing in the morning in the loft before hiking and exploring the area. Close to downtown (we even walked to dinner most nights) and in a charming neighborhood with such friendly neighbors. I can't say enough good things about Mary Lou and Alan - they were so warm and helpful and added such thoughtful touches to our stay (the homemade granola and snacks were much appreciated!) and really made our visit to Salam special :)"

14077210,688530419519973918,2022-08-07,198072093,Mikki,The loft is super cute and comfortable. It's a great location and is a great value for your money. The hosts are excellent. They had snacks and food and well as coffee and even creamer ❤️ It was awesome!

14077210,751562732184532930,2022-11-02,448460018,Sue,"I don’t think I’ve ever stayed in a nicer place. Surrounded by art on a hill in the trees with every amenity provided. The yard surrounding is stunning. The neighborhood is charming, friendly and walkable. I stayed here two weeks after my daughter and son in law who live a block away had their baby. I took care of them all day. This little bungalow took care of me each night and morning. Mary Lou was so helpful. Her positive energy is an important part of it all."
14077210,754518665776819157,2022-11-06,35912642,Thomas,"I found myself saying this place felt magical. This despite a heavy rainstorm. The artworks are special, and I found a book, signed by the author who stayed here, about his climbing Everest. Had to read that!<br/>Will stay again."

14077210,796494424436452815,2023-01-03,114421194,Nicole,"Very comfortable and inviting loft space in a quiet and peaceful and walkable neighborhood.  All the interesting art really makes the space special and sets it apart from others. There were many thoughtful touches, including books, coffee, tea, and better than average snacks, to get you started. Hosts are very friendly, welcoming, and responsive. I highly recommend the art loft and would absolutely stay here again."
14077210,810311401517016914,2023-01-22,64815964,Timothy,"My wife and I have stayed at the Art Loft several times while visiting family in Salem.  There's nothing not to love about the space, especially if you're an art lover and looking to get a sampling of some of the work of local artists that Mary Lou represents.  Looking forward to our next stay!"
14077210,831252739768548219,2023-02-20,15927282,Sybil,"This place is an absolute gem. Beautiful, cozy, light filled apartment space with lovely art and a gorgeous yard, fantastic walkable neighborhood, views of the mountains at sunrise, friendly hosts, spotless and well appointed."

14556351,104165242,2016-09-25,1291019,Willo,"We had a great stay at Matthew's lovely house. We had everything we needed and it was very clean and comfortable. We only wish we had more time to take advantage of all the spaces. Matthew was responsive and welcoming before and during the stay and offered to give us any recommendations we needed. We would stay here again. Thanks, Matthew!"
14556351,110237974,2016-10-24,49103423,Danny,"House is big and easily accommodated our party. House is clean. Probably need a shower in the masters bedroom bathroom. Matthew responded promptly when we have some issue with the coffee maker, he brought a replacement unit."
14556351,120943371,2016-12-12,95938645,Kayla,"Our stay at Matthew's was truly unique and wonderful!  As a local professional theatre company, we bring out of town talent for our productions on a regular basis.  This time around, we housed all of our out of town talent in Matthew's home for an extended five weeks of rehearsals and performances.  Salem has been having an unseasonably cold fall, and Matthew was amazing with continuing to provide and make sure that everyone was comfortable.  There is only parking space for one or two cars, but it worked out great for us.  Bus stop close by, and just a wonderful view.  The home itself is truly unique and has wonderful charm in its architecture and design.  A wonderful experience and hoping to visit Matthew again in the future with more out-of-state performers."
14556351,123799571,2016-12-30,25813622,Marlie,"Matthew's place was lovely and in a really beautiful and quiet neighborhood. He was communicative and helpful throughout the whole process. Almost all of our issues during our stay were centered around the space being a little tricky with a 2-year-old...definitely not Matthew or the house's fault! Due to the nature of the layout and the decor, I would only recommend staying with kids who are old enough to understand not touching things and who navigate stairs well. A group of adults/teens would do just fine!"
14556351,133448413,2017-02-22,117060694,Josh,Beautiful 1950 Neo-Victorian that felt like home as soon as we pulled up. Matt was a great host. We will for sure be coming back next time we are in town.
14556351,138811870,2017-03-21,42939694,Katie,The home is beautiful and within walking distance of a great grocery store and restaurants. It was the perfect location for my out-of-town colleagues to stay during their short trip to Salem. Matthew was very accommodating and easy to get in touch with. We felt very welcome in his home. 
14556351,141364417,2017-04-02,17922547,Samuel,"Michael was more than acommodating.  A freash bottle of Red waiting for us when we arrived, superb location, amazing communication and a house to fall in love with over and over"
14556351,141944010,2017-04-05,36171862,Nikki,"Matthews home was HUGE and beautiful, plenty of room for 4 adults to have their own space and bathroom. We loved enjoying our coffee on the back porch in the morning, as well as the super comfortable beds. Matthew was very attentive and on site for most of our stay to help with anything we needed. I would definitely stay again for my next trip to Salem. Thanks Matthew!"
14556351,142548943,2017-04-08,119032968,Kathleen,Great home located near downtown Seattle. Matthew communicated great and the house was ready when we arrived - including fresh flowers and a bottle of wine to greet us. Definitely recommend.

The homemade cookies and bottle of wine were a<br/>Welcoming touch ! We had 6 adults 2 children and the accommodations were more than adequate the beds were comfy! Thanks for a memorable family visit during our daughters college graduation from Willamette univ <br/>The location was also perfect just a quick drive to everything and a walk to a playground for the kids ! 
14556351,166227644,2017-07-03,116096494,Andrew,"We had a great stay at Matthew's home.  The house was clean when we arrived and the kids enjoyed playing in the house and having their own beds for the stay.  We were in town for a wedding and the house's location allowed us to get easily to several venues, including a meal in town.  We also enjoyed the riverfront park area while we were in town.  It was a very nice stay and Matthew was a great host."
14556351,167437007,2017-07-06,98661973,Carla,"Matthew's home was absolutely beautiful. He was so accommodating, showing us around personally.

Matthew was a bonus- he was extremely helpful and a great host! I would highly recommend his property!!! (As an Airbnb host I was very impressed!) Thanks Matthew!! 
14556351,190575142,2017-09-04,111445247,Joseph,"It's definitely a cute little house. The cleanliness was sub par. There were ants all over the kitchen, left over coffee in the coffee pot the day we checked in. Under one of the beds looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in a few years. A lot of spiders everywhere (which I understand you may not be able to help given there are no screens on the Windows). The toilets each had there own issues but worked overall."
14556351,192468878,2017-09-10,93221341,Anne,"Lovely house with room for plenty! The rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious!  We loved the great second floor options!!   The neighborhood is quiet and close to many restaurants and freeway access.   Matthew was warm and greeted us when we arrived......and helped us out with a special request during our stay.   Great spot for a trip to Salem or nearby cities!"
14556351,197203391,2017-09-24,133286061,Lauren,This place is beautiful and super clean!  Matthew was super helpful and accommodating!  Would definitely stay here again! Thank you!
14556351,198495781,2017-09-29,117036485,Tahnoqua,Matthew's home was spacious and beautiful. The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful...very good for resting after a long trip! Matthew was a gracious and responsive host whose hospitality helped us make the most of a trip we did not want to take- saying goodbye to a loved one
14556351,213080769,2017-11-19,135250988,Shane,The house was beautiful the owner is awesome to deal with would recommend this a 1000 times the furnishings are amazing

14556351,234705437,2018-02-13,166653518,Alicia,"This was a lovely get-away right in a lovely neighborhood with quiet, safe streets.  And yet, we were minutes from everything we needed to access! Matthew was super-responsive and helpful, and the house was great for our big group, with plenty of space to spread out and relax.  We really enjoyed a relaxed atmosphere to come home to at the end of our conference!"
14556351,235718491,2018-02-17,118859660,Gordon,"This is a great house to stay in, especially if you are a large family. We were in town for a funeral and found the place perfect for our needs. Matthew was great to work with and responded quickly to our needs."
14556351,240419813,2018-03-04,118702103,Khang,"Matthew's place is really nice, and he is very helpful to us."

The house was clean and very charming and made us all feel at home. I’m also very thankful for our host Matthew for making us feel at home and giving us tips on how to get around the area.
14556351,244464730,2018-03-18,16835448,Candy,Lovely space for a group!

The kitchen is well-equipped. I wish it hadn't rained so much, otherwise I know we would have enjoyed going out onto the really pretty porch area. We had a great time! Thank you!!"
14556351,257895760,2018-04-27,888114,Deevy,"The house was a great alternative to hotel rooms during a week-long training with colleagues. The house has four solid / separate bedrooms and a couple other less formal sleeping options. The neighborhood is really great - we were able to walk everywhere each evening after our sedentary training days.  Beds and sheets are super comfortable. House decor and structure vary somewhat from room to room; some of the bathroom plumbing shows its age. Great spot, so glad we found it and would return again in a similar situation."
14556351,260710156,2018-05-04,72564634,William /Tool Tech LLC.,"Matthew's place...Best choice for Salem, OR."
14556351,264756331,2018-05-14,113442351,Cate,Great location in a lovely neighborhood. Big Home perfect for a big family gathering. Price was quite high as it was graduation weekend for Willamette but it met our needs well.
14556351,273633876,2018-06-06,192500445,Brent,"Matt provided an amazing house with all sorts of quirky architectural details, lovely bedding and one outstanding porch for enjoying the Oregon weather. The stay was great here, Matt was very quick to respond to questions and provide suggestions and overall the experience was fantastic. Highly recommended!"
14556351,275314744,2018-06-10,15064174,Demetrius,"I woled highly recommend this home. It is in a great location with everything close at hand. The home has everything one would need for a night in, or heading out. Most of all, this home is comfortable and CLEAN."
14556351,278347920,2018-06-17,60440104,Mary Anne,"Very few homes have the number of beds and bedrooms to host my family, but Matthew's place was perfect!  We each had our own bed and only a few had to share a room.  The living room and kitchen are great gathering places.  The backyard is beautiful with all the flowers and plants.  Birds love it too!"
14556351,281319003,2018-06-24,172674393,Chris,"Our family of five really enjoyed this fun house.  It was in great shape, and the location was fantastic!"

14556351,287893783,2018-07-08,20170611,Jennifer,"Easy entrance and speedy response from Matthew.  Heads up for those with children- <br/>one bed is at the top of a loft that you access with a ladder.  Super cool for older kids.  But don’t  count on using it for a younger kid that could possibly wake up in the middle of the night. We ended up having a child share the bed with parents so that he wasn’t potentially climbing down half  asleep in a dark house.  Overall, great spot with easy access to everything."
14556351,288812403,2018-07-10,19861124,Logan,Amazing house and amazing owner. Thank you so much!

As my family is ver musical, it was exciting to have the piano and guitar. They were well used during the visit. <br/>The house was so comfortable, an old charm feeling. When we come back to Salem, this is the first place will look at to see if it is available."

14556351,365865039,2019-01-01,22662467,Mr & Mrs,"Ages 4 - 68, our family group worked well in this home. Plenty of space. 3.5 restrooms was a bonus compared to homes we've had in the past. Christmas decorations were still up for us to enjoy and the two dining tables, plus kitchen bar left us room to leave out and work on a large jigsaw puzzle. There were plenty of dishes and utensils. The tea and spice collection was nice as well. Matthew responded promptly whenever we had a question. We enjoyed our stay."

14556351,415847001,2019-02-23,229469431,Zachery,"A large beautiful home awaits the renter, with comfortably situated sitting and playing areas.

The owner went out of his way to make sure my students had a welcoming and beautiful home to return to after their long days at the Oregon State Acting Festival.  Don't bother reserving rooms at the Grand Hotel if you want an elegant home base for a Salem visit:  make a reservation at the Ben Lomond House."

14556351,533463308,2019-09-21,66102109,Barbara,"This was the perfect place for our extended family of 8 to stay.  It was roomy, clean and comfortable.  Matthew was a pleasure to work with.  He made himself available if needed but was not intrusive at all.  Highly recommended."
14556351,562455744,2019-11-10,9148851,Leah,"We were a smaller group of 3 and the house was very spacious and comfortable.  Super clean and well equipped with everything we needed.  Enjoyed having the piano:).  Matthew met us at check-in, offered tips for our visit and pro-actively kept in touch throughout our stay.  A great location.  Highly recommended!"
14556351,566232810,2019-11-18,151716126,Martin,Very nice place to stay.  Our whole family stayed together and it was near my daughter whom we were visiting.  Comfy beds and ample room to eat together.  Nice house!
14556351,570504862,2019-11-29,196046349,Doris,"We spent Thanksgiving week in Salem and needed a space for 7 of us to stay (including 3 kids under 5 who needed lots of room to run!), as well as for more extended family to come and visit. This large, fun, well laid out house was perfect, and we are so grateful to have had such a lovely home in which to celebrate the holiday with family. My father-in-law who visited is in a wheelchair, and we were able to get him in fairly easily, so that he could be present and enjoy this visit with kids, grandkids, and great grandkids. So much more for the money than hotel rooms could have ever provided! The kids are still talking about ""the big house in Oregon"" and all the fun they had. We hope to be back someday! Also, Matthew was fabulous at communicating quickly and thoroughly, which made everything so easy. Thank you!"
14556351,589258608,2020-01-05,9577127,Kayla,Matthew’s place was awesome! The accommodations were wonderful! The beds were so comfortable and the house was lovely.
14556351,601133170,2020-02-02,310739629,Alan,Great home come check it out
14556351,635246258,2020-07-05,35108508,Mingma,Big spacious house but some deep cleaning is needed. There was spider webs and ants in the room. Don’t bother to look into closets to find towels or bedsheets. The house has more potential if it’s well maintained and cleaned.
14556351,640590850,2020-07-20,32710004,Lorrie,"This is a big, beautiful house to stay in! Due to Covid-19 we did most of our cooking and dining at the house, and we had everything we needed. The porch provides a lovely view and place to dine. Make sure you do note that this house does not have A/C, so it gets a bit warm during the day in the summer, but the nights are wonderfully cool. There are lots of fans in the house to help keep the air moving. I highly recommend staying here."
14556351,643424450,2020-07-27,236504255,Danna,"Such a beautiful home!!  If you have a large group this home is the way to go.  We all got to stay together, instead of separate hotel rooms.  We made some pretty unforgettable memories spending quality time with family.  We had everything we could have needed and more!  Will definitely be staying here again!  Matthew was a wonderful host."
14556351,647081843,2020-08-05,32357964,Jim,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Great location, has everything you need. Owner is super responsive.  Nice and spacious, and comfortable.  Back porch is awesome, great backyard. Has all you need."

14556351,662173998,2020-09-08,359464552,Megan,"Great location, host was very responsive and helpful. Communication from host with check in was not correct and unfortunately the house wasn’t ready upon arrival because of it. Overall good experience and enjoyed the stay!!"
14556351,666542730,2020-09-20,57206552,Vicki,Matthew's place was just as it was pictured in the posting. It is an older Victorian home with tons of character. My 3 adult children and my grandchildren joined me and we never felt like we were on top of each other. It felt like we were gathered in a relatives home. We had plenty of towels and hand soap. My grandchildren loved the books and toys that were there. I would definitely recommend this place. Matthew happened to be there when we checked in and offered his assistance with anything we needed. The kitchen was well-stocked and we had everything we could have possibly needed.
14556351,701768868,2020-10-18,167788463,Emily,Matthew was a great host. Very responsive and the house was perfect for our weekend. Highly recommend!
14556351,712762856,2020-11-30,37500091,Lori,Matthew is a wonderful host. The home is large and perfect for families in a nice neighborhood and close to everything. Nicely equipped kitchen for cooking.
14556351,729721620,2021-02-07,219348553,Christine,"We had a great time at Matthews house.  It's close to stores and places to eat.  The beds are really comfortable!!,.  Matthew's communication is quick to respond to questions.  He was there to greet us when we got there and walked thru the house to explain different things.  After that, we really didn't see him even though he stays above the garage when he rents the house.  Total privacy when you are there.<br/><br/>The only thing I would note regarding the pictures is that there wasn't a foosball table and the backyard wasn't what it appeared to be in the photos - maybe part of that was because of the time of the year that we were there.<br/><br/>Overall - great stay for the cost."
14556351,737813579,2021-03-09,386148412,Danielle,Matthew is a nice host! Very responsive and made things easy .
14556351,744169628,2021-03-31,71392558,Michael,Matthew was great and communicated well through our trip.  We had a minor issue that was quickly.  Matthew also made some extra accommodations with our check-in.  We will stay here again without hesitation.
14556351,759718322,2021-05-17,34752465,Rachel,"Matthew was gracious and accommodating. From answering questions to his flexibility with check-in and check-out. He made it easy to be there. We also really appreciated the number of bedrooms and bathrooms for our extended family gathering. And the home’s proximity to Willamette University was perfect. <br/><br/>One thing I do wish I had known ahead of time is that this is a family’s home, personalized and containing the belongings, food, etc. of the people who live there. It feels like visiting relatives rather than staying in a vacation home. This was not a problem, just an adjustment of expectations.<br/><br/>Overall it was a great space and Matthew made us feel welcome."
14556351,404392056208393684,2021-07-11,385048087,Kyle,"Very cute and clean 1950’s era home.  Close to everything you would need, but also everything you need in the home for a stay. Great communication from the owner. We look forward to staying here again."
14556351,419572269686300722,2021-08-01,169732583,Jason,Great location. Great host. Huge house with all you need for a small to large<br/>Group. Definitely recommend staying here.

14556351,464571559298643585,2021-10-02,140844451,Michael,Place was great.  Very clean and much larger than it looks.  Very close to Willamette campus and in quiet neighborhood.  Great communication with host and we would not hesitate to return in the future.  Thanks.
14556351,470267439974621494,2021-10-10,350235285,Iza,"House is stunning and huge. Parking is limited to 3 cars in the driveway, however there was plenty of street parking just a block or two away. Neighborhood seems safe and quaint."
14556351,474647671217234531,2021-10-16,154116350,Jeremiah,"We have stayed here several times, each experience has been great. Matthew has great communication, we will stay here again for sure."
14556351,485572060614145794,2021-10-31,184708666,Kelly,"Matthew was a lovely host. We actually had a pretty difficult trip due to a family member passing. Matthew was kind and was flexible. He cared more about our well-being than anything. Highly recommend the space for multi family get together’s. It was large and had enough space to have privacy but also large enough areas to gather all together. One of my favorite elements was walking distance to a restaurant and also a back patio with beautiful lights! But, honestly there is so much to love about the house."
14556351,526184643885662105,2021-12-26,16167023,Tom,"Terrific home. Going in we knew the house was spacious, but still it was a delight to ""discover"" the upstairs with its seemingly endless collection of airy rooms and loft, and fun to watch everyone else's delight as they made the same discovery. The house provided the perfect venue for a family holiday gathering. Great host. Matthew provided just the right information at the right time and was accommodating and supportive throughout our stay. Keeping this one on our list of favorites."
14556351,537067147327361485,2022-01-10,86961813,Rexley,"We had a wonderful time staying at Matthew's place. Other than it being an older house, it has a lot of character and had plenty of room for our party of 8. Matthew was also a great host, getting us the space we need but always letting know to that he was available anytime if we needed him. Definitely would recommend."
14556351,545057659710663677,2022-01-21,126657843,Lee,Matthew is a great host.  Very quick to communicate and has a beautiful home.

We had an easy check-in, plenty of space to spread out, and tons of home staples and extras we might have needed. The host was incredibly friendly and attentive, and made us feel especially welcome. The kids in our group had so much fun exploring the different parts of the house, and the adults all loved the quiet back porch and beautiful books on display throughout. We will definitely stay again."

This would be a great place for folks with children. The upstairs is a kids hangout dream!  We enjoyed the artwork, wonderful books, lovely dishware and general great vibe of this home.

She is a lovely hostess and after visiting I discovered that she knew my daughter that had worked at the same facility that she had. What a small world. <br/>The house is beautiful built in 1903,with early 20 century amenities .it sets on 2 beautiful acres. I've  already booked a 2nd stay. When I am in that area that is where I'll stay. Thanks Elizabeth for making me feel so welcome<br/>Kathy"

15272064,108640031,2016-10-16,98945325,Robin,"This was our first stay with an Air BnB and we found the perfect place and host to stay with.  Her home is lovely and Elizabeth did everything in her power to make us feel welcome and comfortable.  Even Chloe (the dog) and the cats were well behaved and made us feel they were glad we came.  We had told Elizabeth that this was an anniversary trip and she even put flowers and candy in our room for us--a very unexpected surprise!  She said that she is looking forward to decorating the house for the holidays and we hope we can go back to see it at that time of year.  We can't recommend Elizabeth and her home highly enough.  We felt like we were visiting an old friend and enjoyed talking with this intelligent and well traveled lady.  The room was clean and comfortable with a TV and internet access.  There was a coffee maker and small fridge in the room.  The bathroom also was clean and had everything we could ask for in it.  And the gorgeous turquoise tile floor was so shiny, we kept thinking it was wet.  We truly had a wonderful, relaxing stay. "

The room was very spacious, had a lovely fireplace that Elizabeth already had a nice fire going in for me, a private bathroom that was directly attached to the room & the bed was a king sized slice of heaven that I just melted to sleep in. Everything was beautiful, clean & smelled wonderful. She also had nice little soaps & toiletries available. I was bummed that my stay was so brief, would have loved to explore the house & property more. It was conveniently located to town but felt nice and private. Anyone who stays here is in for a treat!

My daughter stayed the night prior to her LCSW test, and Elizabeth was so gracious to understand that my daughter needed to just study...and Elizabeth even offered her own, naturally lit office for my daughter. The location is perfect~close to stores and a park, but it feels like you're in the forest. The lovely bedroom was tastefully decorated and had the most beautiful linens and towels, and toiletries in the bath. Elizabeth even provided a freshly washed bed for my daughter's dog...and puppy treats! My daughter felt so at-home and welcomed in Elizabeth's home, and I felt that she was in the perfect spot. She, and I, would highly recommend this beautiful home & host!"

I brought a cover for the bed since my dogs like to sleep with me, although she also offered me an option when I thought I had forgotten mine. I can recommend this place highly."

15272064,130961491,2017-02-09,9784246,J. Kathleen,"I stayed at Elizabeth's home during the work week for over three months of business travel. She was the perfect hostess. Friendly and welcoming, but unobtrusive. Her home is beautiful and perfectly set up for business travel or a romantic get-away. "
15272064,131553926,2017-02-12,92163452,Kristy,"Very cute, cozy and well decorated room. Definitely worth the price and we loved that it has an attached bath. "

I stopped over on my way through and it was perfect for a night stay with everything I needed. She even allowed my pup, which was risk with other guests in the house, but everything turned out great.<br/>Directions to the place were very clear and once I wondered around the giant house, I found my room :)<br/>I would certainly stay again!"

15272064,136139007,2017-03-08,117045066,Sage,"My boyfriend and I only stayed one night at Elizabeth's gorgeous home, but it was worth it! She was at work when we arrived but kept in touch and made sure we settled in nicely. Although the upstairs is a bit drafty she provided us with a space heater which got things warmed up in no time. The location is excellent - right off a main road, about 5 minutes from downtown, but it feels very private and secluded which was nice. "
15272064,136446038,2017-03-10,119802666,David,"Bonnie locale, quiet, terrific host and a lovely place to stay. We hope to stay with you again."

15272064,137341544,2017-03-14,120230644,Tim,Don't hesitate to stay here. The room is nicer than most hotels with all the same amenities and privacy. The location gets your right in the heart of Salem and wine country
15272064,138038728,2017-03-18,24303295,Charity,"Lovely, cozy, well-equipped, just perfect. Stayed here for a couple nights while my son toured the local college. Everything was clean and organized and the bed was incredibly comfortable. Close to everything but still quiet and off the main street. Truly a wonderful stay for a wonderful price!"

It is surprisingly close to a business district in Salem, yet very secluded and quiet.   <br/>Elizabeth is a gracious host who made us feel welcome.   She provided basic morning essentials, coffee, oatmeal, bananas, yogurt, etc.   <br/>We look forward to staying here again.   "
15272064,139129530,2017-03-23,7364731,Annie,"This is a large home on a quiet lot in a convenient location in Salem.

15272064,139491403,2017-03-25,17571578,Kayleen,"Elizabeth and her son were wonderful hosts for my very short stay in Salem. Although I was only there for sleeping, I could see that the house is beautiful and well appointed. My room was very comfortable, and the bedding was gorgeous! I really appreciated all of the little amenities contained within just the bedroom space. I know that if I had stayed for longer, I would have been just as comfortable. I will definitely be staying with Elizabeth again for my next visit! "
15272064,139868316,2017-03-26,121936797,John,To who reads our review:<br/><br/>I can say without reservation that this was one of the best experances that me and the better half have had in awhile. <br/><br/>We took a few days to do some leisure travel when the kids were away at camp for Spring Break. <br/>You will not be disappointed. The house is super clean with great wood floors through out.  The rugs where warming and accented the rooms.  <br/><br/>All the décor matched and well it was just pleasant at every turn and room nook and cranny. <br/><br/>Our room had excellent view of the garden area. <br/>The morning and evening light was inspiring. <br/><br/>The amenities were world class and the linins were quite nice. <br/>The Bed made sleep easy and we both woke  up very rested and ready to take on the day. <br/>And the furniture in our room was just right for a short or extended stay.  <br/>The chair by the window was relaxing and allowed me to catch up on some reading. <br/>The flat screen mounted on the wall allowed me to catch up on news and was the right size and was great quality. <br/><br/>The home is located close to a good restaurant’s of all types.  There are a couple of places for night life for dancing jazz & rock and country all within a very short drive. <br/><br/>We can both say you will not be disappointed. <br/><br/>Elizabeth is a Fantastic host and the Home is full of charm and elegance!!!<br/><br/>J and D <br/>P.S. the Coffee in our room was fantastic and we know as we are coffee aficionados’ <br/>
15272064,140967188,2017-04-01,22584623,Richard,"Great place to stay, especially since it's close to our relatives.  Comfortable room with all the basic amenities.  We intend to come back again in the future.  "
15272064,141298718,2017-04-02,68189296,Thu,"Elizabeth was an incredible host - excellent and clear communication, welcomed us when we arrived to show us around her beautiful home and provided us everything we needed. The room was cozy and comfortable with everything we needed: mini-fridge, coffee maker, microwave - on par with some of the nicest hotels and BnB's we've stayed at. She has a sweet dog and some chickens in the backyard. We happened to stay with her on a weekend when she was at home and she made an incredible breakfast that she kindly offered to us as well! An unexpected treat (some of the best pancakes we've ever had), so if you happen to time it right, you may happen to catch an awesome breakfast too. We are musicians on tour, and Elizabeth even came out to our show in town and brought a friend. As a host, she went above and beyond and we highly recommend her and her amazing home if you are coming to Salem, OR! "
15272064,141568246,2017-04-03,42245753,Liz,Great location

15272064,144870941,2017-04-16,40625220,Alex,"We had a wonderful stay with Elizabeth. Because of some circumstances unforseen, we had to check-in very late. Elizabeth was able to accomodate us, which we very much appreciated. Her home was wonderful, warm, and cleanly! Our bed was soooo comfortable. Overall, a wonderful experience."
15272064,146796763,2017-04-23,94874443,Larry,"The home was easy to find and priced right.  My only complaint was that the room shown on the internet is not what we stayed in.  The house has 4 rooms, 3 smaller ones, and 1 nice larger one shown on the site.  The house was a convenient location for our visit to Willamette."
15272064,147250442,2017-04-25,50323913,Kay,Wonderful house and grounds. Fabulous hostess.  fresh flowers in all the rooms! I will definitely be back.

15272064,148030190,2017-04-29,123625745,Tiffany,"Elizabeth was a very gracious host.  Her amazing home is on a quiet residential street back away from the road with beautiful trees, very peaceful.  But right around the corner is anything you could need in restaurants and stores.  The room was clean and cozy and decorated in a charming vintage style.  The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in!  Fresh fruit, oatmeal, yogurt, water, coffee and tea were provided complimentary.  And the gorgeous tulips were a nice welcoming touch!  Was even greeted by the sweet puppy dog Chloe.  Elizabeth checked in via email and to make sure everything was good while I was at my conference.  A very pleasant experience for my first AirBnB adventure, will be back when business takes me to Salem again."
15272064,148464774,2017-04-30,76844630,Edward,Friendly host and nice location.

It was warm, clean, had everything I needed and more (as did the larger room I previously stayed in). It's a lovely vintage home within a few miles to downtown  Capitol Building, and Willamette University. Public transportation is 1 block away. I would definitely stay again!"

15272064,152280035,2017-05-15,3940843,Gemma,"Such a great experience. Knowing we'd be pulling in late,we let Elizabeth know,and even though she was working even later, she told us how to let ourselves in, and encouraged us to reach out to her, or her son, for anything we needed.<br/>The bedroom we were in (Elizabeth has 2 or 3 rooms to rent) was small and bright with a luxurious  feel....Lovely bedding, efficient storage for Mr.Coffee, plates, cutlery, a fruit bowl,mini fridge with yogurts and waters, and a generous stash of nice products in the end suite bathroom.<br/>The home is quiet, sitting on an acre of land, with fresh flowers everywhere. <br/>We caught up with our Host over coffee on Sunday morning and came away from our stay feeling we'd made a wonderful new friend. <br/>Will definitely  be back!"

The private bathroom is great as well. It was a lovely, comfortable stay and we would recommend it to anyone visiting Salem. "

I was traveling in from the East Coast and did not want to stay in Portland after my long flight and time change.  It was so easy to rest here before my 4 hour drive south!  My only regret is that I did not personally get the opportunity to meet my very capable host (because I was still on East Coast timing....).  It couldn't have been more pleasant or restful...."

15272064,180980266,2017-08-11,81700942,Stephanie,Elizabeth's house is so lovely. Definitely a gem of Salem. It's so cute and tucked in behind beautiful tress. Would definitely stay again the next time I'm in Salem.
15272064,182905650,2017-08-15,9317198,Keltha,"We had a spotlessly clean and lovely room.  Well appointed with a small refrigerator and microwave as well.  Could be a little noisy as people came and went up and down the stairs.  Elizabeth is welcoming and has a beautiful and very large home.  As she has a couple of rooms upstairs to rent, while she lives in the downstairs, there is a sense of privacy.  Centrally located and in a nice neighborhood."
15272064,183266204,2017-08-16,87152776,Brett,"We just popped in late to sleep and were off early the next morning.  The house was open and ready for us, instructions clear and Elizabeth made sure to check in and see that we had everything we needed."

15272064,185511831,2017-08-21,12885327,Qingling,"It was almost last minute when we decided to take the plunge and go to Salem for the total eclipse no matter what price we have to pay. I had been checking the listings for a while, not to mention the steep price, most places didn't look remotely like the places I wanted to stay at. When I saw Elisabeth's listing, I almost couldn't believe I would find such place at a reasonable price just 2 weeks before the event. Top reviews from many reviewers, and the place looks nice in the pictures. I wrote to Elisabeth to ask about her pet policy, and it was after midnight, but I got response back right away! And it's her communication style throughout the process, very timely response all the time!<br/><br/>Her place is indeed very nice, clean  and cozy room, nicely set up with everything, we even have our own small fridge considerably loaded with water. The whole place is like in a garden. Her place is also conveniently located. Everything is close by, good restaurants, Minto-Brown park... It turned out we really got lucky for being able to book her place. She was not going to rent her place out at the beginning, but due to her knee injury, she had to cancel her own plan and stay home.<br/><br/>Now let's get to our great experience. She had a family gathering, and we got invited to the party. We got to enjoy the company of her friendly family and also the great home-made food! I felt guilty that her family did all the work serving us... The morning of the eclipse, we were served with scrambled eggs laid by her own free-range chicken, the best eggs I've ever had. And her daughter also made delicious pancakes for us. Can't believe how lucky were are! (disclaimer: breakfast is not standard part of what you get). Our puppy also had a blast playing with Elisabeth's dog Chloe.<br/><br/>All guests, Elisabeth and her daughter (Melissa) went to watch the eclipse together, it was just the right crowd to share the special day with! This trip is definitely a very memorable trip for us! Couldn't ask for better!"
15272064,186859573,2017-08-25,96590879,Bettie,"Elizabeth is a fantastic host who was attentive to all our needs.  Her home is a special oasis in Salem, a fun capital city of Otegon, a great state!"
15272064,188528695,2017-08-29,23350045,Ann,Great property - nice rooms and beds with windows.  Elizabeth is very welcoming and made us feel at home.  I have found my Salem home when visiting my daughter at college.
15272064,189150899,2017-08-31,1299104,Brian,"The house is absolutely beautiful and an incredible value. Elizabeth truly makes her guests feel welcome, even going above and beyond with things like yogurt and bottled water stocked in the room."
15272064,189417652,2017-09-01,4525216,Nicole,"A wonderful place for the night - we arrived late, around 11pm and it was absolutely no problem - Elisabeth greeted us and over a wine we chatted until midnight, Liz even offered us to use the hot tub. The room was lovely, even with coffee, tea and a fridge with fruit and yoghurt and breakfast items for the morning... - We will come again for sure, thank you for opening your house ..."

15272064,197997919,2017-09-27,35105035,Florence,"We stayed three nights while visiting our daughter in Salem.  Elizabeth's place was perfect...from fresh flowers, expansive amenities, cleanliness and a most comfortable bed.  The bathroom was bright and cheery with plenty of everything in case you forgot something.  Loved the bathroom floor!  Elizabeth's responses to any of my questions before arrival were immediate.   It was great having a beautiful outdoor space to use also.<br/><br/>The value was exceptional.  Highly recommend Elizabeth's place and would definitely stay there again."

15272064,202086265,2017-10-09,3053884,Jane,Elizabeth and her son Chis go out of their way to ensure the comfort of their guests. Recommended without reservation.
15272064,202312535,2017-10-10,95937718,Fran,"Elizabeth has a beautiful house with lovely floral arrangements and fresh flowers in your room.  Our room had a microwave and mini fridge which came in handy.  She also provides yogurt, oatmeal, fresh fruit,  coffee and hot chocolate.  There is also a swimming pool, hot tub and wifi.  We would definitely stay here again."

Every.single.detail was thought out with great care.  I was looking for a place to spend the night to ease a long commute - felt like I had had a mini-vacation!"
15272064,210496760,2017-11-09,31674102,Anne,"I would HIGHLY recommend Elizabeth’s home for a visit to Salem. As I have used airbnb for numerous trips --- from France to San Diego --- I can honestly say this was one of the best airbnb experiences I’ve ever had. Communication prior to my arrival was timely and welcoming. When I arrived, I found her lovely estate to be exactly as pictured. My room was not only clean and comfortable (the bed!), there was a broad selection of complimentary toiletries in the bathroom (thank goodness, because I had forgotten my toothbrush!). I found a basket of fruit and a vase with fresh flowers on a tiny desk where I was able to set my iPad to catch up on some work. My room’s “mini-kitchen” had a refrigerator (with yogurt and other items stocked), microwave and coffee maker; yes, there also was freshly ground coffee in the cabinet, tea and oatmeal packets, along with dishware, glassware and utensils --- everything one would need for a short or extended stay. During my visit, each day my dirty dishes, which were set out on a hallway tray, magically returned to the spot, clean and ready for the next use. Elizabeth and her son, Chris, were so helpful in responding to my every need and made me feel like a welcomed guest in their home."
15272064,219759921,2017-12-18,134587312,Belinda,"I loved the extremely comfortable bed, the plentiful & delicious coffee and the room temperature which was perfect for me! I appreciated that you had the room stocked with extra toiletries including makeup remover wipes, packages of tissues, etc. I look forward to booking my Vista Manor room on future visits to Salem, Oregon."
15272064,229635695,2018-01-24,32930889,Cindy,"Great place, great host! Everything was perfect, so glad I chose to stay at Elizabeth’s. I will definitely stay here again if I get the opportunity!!"

Great bed with view of large old trees and sky.  Greeted with fresh cut flowers in the main living room/parlor and bedroom. Glad the host has kept this gem in the condition it deserves.  Quiet neighborhood too, easy few minutes to the Capitol."
15272064,234182244,2018-02-11,139884325,Jeff,"Great central location just south of downtown. Very nice home and accommodations, and lots of small thoughtful touches that make a difference. Also, excellent communication from the owner."

15272064,244819423,2018-03-19,137730474,Michael,"Elizabeth's home was the perfect place for us to recharge during our hiking trip. The room was stocked with plenty of amenities and had its own coffee maker. We were also quite surprised and intrigued by the animals that roam around the property: cats, dogs, chickens, ducks...they were extremely friendly and made us feel at home. Most of all, Elizabeth was extremely gracious and accommodating. She happened to be absent from the property during our stay, but was quick to respond to questions and gave us clear instructions for check-in. We would highly recommend staying with Elizabeth if you plan to travel through the area and need a quiet, homely retreat."
15272064,245066413,2018-03-20,117546524,Jordyn,This home was quiet and beautiful in a perfect place downtown Salem. I recommend staying here when you need a place :)

15272064,247501462,2018-03-28,18347116,Kathleen,Elizabeth is a wonderful host. She went out of her way to accommodate an earlier check in! Her home is lovely and the accommodations were squeaky clean! Wonderful stay thank you so much Elizabeth!

15272064,250947903,2018-04-06,166086633,Cassie,The room was very nice for the value. We aren’t savvy Airbnb”ers”? Haha. So it has been a new experience and this space was delightful. And the fact that she allowed dogs was a bonus.
15272064,254711623,2018-04-17,162708941,Laurie,"I was in and out fairly quickly, so I didn’t get the chance to fully experience this beautiful home.  However, it was very quiet, which is something I value in an air bnb. I slept soundly and woke up refreshed."
15272064,255193115,2018-04-19,40104763,Ann,"Elizabeth’s place is always a win for us. It’s dog friendly, clean, has the coziest beds, and there are fresh flowers in the room to welcome us. We stay here whenever we are in Salem."

15272064,261669390,2018-05-06,170822377,Christy,We enjoyed the short walk down the hill to the Acme Cafe and Venti's for a super breakfast and dinner. My husband didn't realize that we weren't in a B&B and that we had to walk to get food!  A short walk in the other direction takes you to a little park and through neighborhoods with pretty landscaping especially in spring.<br/><br/>The property is a 'work in progress' as the owner works to bring it back from ivy and blackberries so you can't really go out and sit but it was really too cool to do that anyway.  I got a kick out of walking out back and checking out the chickens and rabbits.
15272064,262681368,2018-05-09,5600298,Rebecca,"This was a wonderful Airbnb experience. The bed is super comfy, the room had every little convenience including coffee maker, microwave and mini refrigerator. Elizabeth is a warm and welcoming host as well.

15272064,268075065,2018-05-23,85337239,Richard,A great host as advertised!<br/>We enjoyed our one-night stay on our way to California.  The room and extra touches were beautiful... we had a butterfly motif.  The only thing that would have made it better was if the window's could be opened to let in some fresh Oregon air at night.  The bed was great and we slept very soundly.  And in the morning we had some organic fruit to start the day :~)
15272064,271572944,2018-06-01,115188265,George,Gracious home and hostess - our Salem homebase whenever we come to town.
15272064,272628000,2018-06-03,46773,Kerwin,Beautiful house centrally located in Salem. Secluded woodsy feel in the city. In-room bathroom and mini-fridge were great and the jacuzzi was a delightful surprise. Glad I brought a bathing suit.
15272064,273937756,2018-06-07,57373859,Robert,Awesome place and an awesome host! Really nice and hospitable. Best part of the place was the hot tub. It was also very convenient because it was so close to the highway. Highly recommend.

15272064,275374194,2018-06-10,131395016,Eric,"First of all, Elizabeth is an exceptional host. Never have I felt so welcome as a guest in someone else's home. I would stay with her in a heartbeat if in the Salem area again because of her kindness alone. She also is extremely responsive and competent as a host; has an immaculate, charming house with many great spaces she shares with guests (including a large, verdant, highly functional backyard; a pool and a hot tub; and common areas on the first floor); and charges a meager rate in comparison to what she provides for guests. Although my stay was brief, Elizabeth provided me with an unparalelled AirBnB experience that I don't expect will ever be matched."
15272064,275734040,2018-06-11,13635734,Geoffrey,"Everything was greater than I expected, simply fantastic! Thanks again Elizabeth ;)"
15272064,276109407,2018-06-12,53595624,Anna,The best Airbnb I’ve stayed in. Everything was perfect!! Elizabeth’s place was warm and cozy.

15272064,282564618,2018-06-27,76157804,Jill,Clean and comfortable. Good value and location 
15272064,282965656,2018-06-28,55346071,Beth Anne,"My daughter and I stayed here for one night on our college tour.  It was a great place. Elizabeth wasn't home at the time, but it was really easy to find and check-in and check-out were self-explanatory based on her communication.  The house was really cute, as was our room.  We were so tired that we just basically huddled in bed and watched tv, but the room had all these special touches (a microwave, plates, a coffee maker, small fridge, etc) and the bathroom was full of soaps/shampoos/lotions. Also, it wasn't more than 10 minutes from downtown Salem/Willamette University/the hospital so really convenient.  Wish we had been able to stay longer and enjoyed the garden etc.  I highly recommend Vista Manor."
15272064,283330806,2018-06-29,46066136,Valerie,Very nice little room-close to everything and convenient to come and go. Elizabeth is a great host and has a very sweet small cat. Recommended for a quick nights trip to Salem!
15272064,283811256,2018-06-30,44196052,Gary,"This is a beautiful old home. It's old, but so elegant.

The grounds are fascinating - complete with bunnies, gorgeous chickens and an friendly cat!  So quiet - no we didn't have to kill the rooster to get a good night's sleep.  Highly recommend!!"

We traveled for a month and spent the entire time at Airbnb, and we have to say, that Elizabeth's  is in our top three.  Elizabeth has such a caring heart and you will feel very much at home from the moment that you meet her. She seems to think of everything, all the details, all the things that are comfortable to one who is traveling.<br/><br/>We were traveling out to the West Coast to attend a wedding. Elizabeth's incredible bedroom suite, equipped with its own bathroom, not to mention how beautifully decorated it is, was absolutely divine for preparing for such an important event.<br/><br/>Do not hesitate to book this wonderful space! You will absolutely not be disappointed! Expect to be surprised and delighted by all the special touches that she provides. :-)"
15272064,293127625,2018-07-19,154366758,Jamie,This Airbnb feels just like home and is very calming. The whole property is beautiful and well kept. The room was well stocked with all essentials and the host was very accommodating. We immediately felt welcomed and noticed beautiful personal touches all around the house. Would highly recommend staying here (and the hot tub was an added bonus!)
15272064,294986746,2018-07-22,38373688,Monica,Elizabeth was a fabulous host. I was staying in Salem while I was participating at the art show. She made the stay completely worry free. It was more than I expected-the fridge was stocked with water and yogurt and milk and cereal were available. She checked on me during the show asking if I needed anything and left extra water bottles for me. I was even able to park my small trailer there. I would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend Elizabeth's place!

A beautiful and quiet place to stay with many spaces to enjoy outside of your personal room. Trees, garden, patio, pool, all gorgeous!"
15272064,301200015,2018-08-03,111631062,Susan,"Room was clean, comfortable, convenient location, excellent hospitality."
15272064,301790201,2018-08-04,70238558,Tim,"Beautiful private room with all the amenities that one could need!  Definitely, would make this a priority stay when back in Salem.  "
15272064,302534230,2018-08-05,33871872,Betty,Beautiful 1923 Tudor home with great Gardens and a pool!! Great location and easy access with everything you could need. Will be back.
15272064,303175914,2018-08-06,74371423,Dick,This is truly a beautiful place. Elizabeth is very generous and her accommodations are magnificent. 
15272064,303596507,2018-08-07,199324451,Randa,"Our hostess greeted us as we arrived and show us around the lovely property, pointing out places to relax and take in the ambiance. The amenities were spot on and the home quiet and clean. We usually just pass through Salem on our way north; but Elizabeth made us want to stay in Salem for a while. We’ll definitely be back!"
15272064,307098981,2018-08-13,196186851,Paul,"A beautiful house, with fair prices and a lovely hostess. Elizabeth was attentive and available for questions and tourist tips, without being intrusive. On several occasions, we were out of the house all day, and she emailed to make sure there was nothing we needed. She provided fresh fruit and muffins which was very much appreciated. It's touches like this that make the stay memorable to weary travellers. Thank you Elizabeth!"
15272064,308088337,2018-08-15,43728573,Diane,"The location is wonderful.  Amenities galore within a few blocks. The home itself is gorgeous, peaceful and quiet.  Super cute room, clean, nice linens, comfy bed. Great private bath with terrific water pressure in the shower .  Add to that Elizabeth stocks your mini fridge with water, yogurts as well as coffee, oatmeal, etc.  She also sets out fresh baked goods for guests!  Great working AC which was much appreciated given it was 95 degrees when we arrived.  We had the good fortune of sipping a drink by the pool and relaxing with her family.  NOW for the kicker...she welcomed our two dogs and allowed them to stay in our room.  Honestly, Elizabeth could charge A LOT more...the value is truly amazing.   We have rented from Airbnb before but always opted for a separate residence.  We are now believers in renting a room thanks to this experience.  A side note...we ate dinner at Venti's just a few blocks away and LOVED it.  "
15272064,309157446,2018-08-17,60564451,Joel,Wonderful place!  Elizabeth was awesome to work with prior to my arrival and is a fantastic host.  Her home is wonderful and the room was GREAT!  Thx Elizabeth!
15272064,310653672,2018-08-19,195282937,Nicole,"Elizabeth is a gem! My Daughter and I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Everything is clean, well thought out and she is an excellent hostess. We loved the pool, hot tub and feeding her animals. It was a very quiet, relaxing place to stay and we will definitely be back! My Daughter really wants to rent her beautiful guest house next time. =)"
15272064,312107982,2018-08-22,52542794,Melissa,"This lovely home reminds me of European B&Bs with en suite and all the little extra touches! You will be welcomed and very comfortable staying here with Elizabeth and her son. Chloe, the pup, is the sweetest girl and the cats are all such love bugs!! I had a fabulous stay here and hope to be able to book again on my return trip soon!"
15272064,312578590,2018-08-23,44098145,Wade,"Clean, comfortable, and a great location in Salem. And an amazing house. Elizabeth was a gracious hostess. Wish we had more time to enjoy pool and patio. We would readily stay here again. "
15272064,313099675,2018-08-24,55448956,Bill,"I simply cannot recommend this place highly enough! This was a place where I only had one night because my hotel room  for the remainder of my stay was being paid for. If I had a different choice, I would’ve stayed here every single night. The place is incredible! There is a swimming pool. There is a hot tub. The house is huge! The upstairs room where I stayed was clean, comfortable and had its own bathroom. Everything I needed was there including extra bathroom and toilet supplies, plus tea,  cocfee, a refrigerator and more! There is a massive backyard where you can sit and enjoy a cup of tea. Further away from the house there are chickens. This place is amazing.  Elizabeth was the consummate host. She offered me some curry that she had made in the evening and some fresh banana bread in the morning. I cannot rate this place highly enough. Run to this place! Do not walk!  10 stars! "
15272064,315029966,2018-08-27,98465993,Steven,"Elizabeth has by far the best place I've stayed at yet!<br/><br/>The amenities were endless it seemed! <br/><br/>Her hospitality was equally endless...<br/><br/>I had the day before check in severely sprained my ankle, upon hearing this Elizabeth supplied me with a set of crutches...<br/><br/>I had dropped my phone in the pool and she quickly supplied me with a bag of rice which kept my phone in perfect condition...<br/><br/>The place was immaculant, with all one would find at a hotel and more!<br/><br/>I will definitely be staying again if I visit the Salem or surrounding area in the future!<br/><br/>As well I'd strongly recommend that you do the same if in the area!"
15272064,315415080,2018-08-28,33458462,Carolyn,"Elizabeth’s is a beautiful, comfortable space.  The beds are terrific and the rooms have absolutely everything you could need—and more!  This morning, there was wonderful homemade apple bread!  "

15272064,318477939,2018-09-03,31044232,Janene,Elizabeth's house is spacious and charming. We had two kinds of homemade bread while we were there that were very tasty. The location is quite good and near many restaurants and groceries. The pricing is a real value. I recommend this home enthusiastically.
15272064,319224898,2018-09-05,69469208,Lisa,Elizabeth's place is beautiful and she has everything set up so you will have everything you need to have a comfortable stay. We would go in a heart beat...it was that nice.

15272064,324751224,2018-09-17,192630487,Marsha,A  cozy calm respite.
15272064,325100811,2018-09-18,145242538,Toni,We had a very nice visit albeit one day. The home is full of great character and conveniently located. An older area of Salem but walking distance to many restaurants. Our host Elizabeth went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and at home!
15272064,327327160,2018-09-23,76421279,Sara,"Really nice location - walkable to some shops and restaurants but in a more secluded wooded neighborhoods. Lots of thoughtful  touches (like lens wipes, lint roller, hair dryer, baked goods!). It's a comfortable room, with a nicely set up private bath. Perfect size for 2 people. Elizabeth, the host, is very easy to reach and responsive."
15272064,327909297,2018-09-24,79861145,Kent,"This is a nice, quiet, comfortable place.  Elizabeth is awesome - she's a great, thoughtful, caring person, and that not only is evidenced in your face-to-face interaction with her, but also in all the care she puts into the room, and the special little treats and amenities that you find while staying there."
15272064,328637757,2018-09-26,16970172,Joseph,"really nice big house , with several airbnb rooms. lots of space and  good location."
15272064,329394727,2018-09-28,24171634,Avital,"Elizabeth’s home was perfect. Great location, lots of added touches with amenities, food, dishes, bathroom supplies... Nicely decorated. Quick responses. It gave me ideas for my Airbnb too!"
15272064,330653819,2018-09-30,186946719,Vittoria,Elizabeth is very hospitable! We had a great time!
15272064,331081229,2018-10-01,74926473,Monica,"Great Stay! Little touches in bathroom supplies, small kitchen supplies, and little fridge were very nice to have and made if feel more like home. Elizabeth communicated extremely well and kept me updated on all things pertaining to my stay. Her pumpkin bread in the morning was very delicious, and she had fruit available, which was a pleasant surprise. The location happened to be a couple of doors down from my destination (wasn't planned that way) so that ended up being a great added perk. I would make a suggestion to put instructions on the Keurig. Since it was a small one, I wasn't sure if I needed to add water or wait for it to heat up. The only other thing I could have asked for were windows that opened for some fresh air in the bedroom area, but the small air conditioner was more than enough to keep the air circulating. All in all, this was a great Air B and B and should I ever travel to the Salem area again, this would be my first choice to stay."
15272064,331470947,2018-10-02,33458462,Carolyn,"Elizabeth really is a Superhost!  The queen room has a comfortable bed, yogurt in the refrigerator, coffee, tea, oatmeal, and grits (grits! Who has grits at an Airbnb but a superhost?) to make, and more helpful amenities in the bathroom than you could ever need.  She goes beyond that, though, baking something for most mornings, and providing fresh fruit.  Truly super!"
15272064,332190532,2018-10-04,9197920,Shannon,"Great character home and area to walk into town. The nice touches of tv, microwave, coffee maker and the homemade apple bread was awesome. Also the bed was fabulously comfortable and the most important to me as I was driving from Vancouver to Vegas and needed a good sleep for the journey!"
15272064,332615970,2018-10-05,67061233,Phillip,"Easy access in & out, really nice home & easy going host!"
15272064,333028448,2018-10-06,45545855,Karen,"I've stayed at many Air BnB's and this is the very BEST!  The bed was incredibly comfortable, the sheets fresh and good quality.  The decor was very classy, charming and artistic.  The home is beautiful and clean.  Elizabeth made it very easy to find her place, she was an excellent communicator.  I felt safe, welcomed and the amenities were above and beyond.  Snacks, yogurt, many toiletries to choose from, beautiful plates, a robe in the closet, even freshly baked pumpkin bread in the morning.  It will definitely be my first pick if I am ever in the area again.  I also loved having my own private bathroom attached to the bedroom. Thanks for a great experience!"
15272064,337242649,2018-10-15,152244303,Cherel,"Lovely home, gracious hostess, perfect location for us!"
15272064,337587653,2018-10-16,100598449,Randy,This is a lovely 1920's home. The common rooms are sumptuously decorated as well as the bedroom.  Snacks and toiletries you may have forgotten are bountiful.  Memory foam mattress very soft and comfortable.
15272064,338900541,2018-10-20,137551720,Eric,What a wonderful stay! Amazing hospitality - great room - and the amenities were on target. Great value
15272064,339675132,2018-10-21,5818793,Jo-Anna & Jacob,"Elizabeth's place was even better than expected. Check-in was easy and communication was great. What really made the stay wonderful was all of the details. So many amenities, all the bases were covered as far as any toiletries or items we may have needed. Would definitely recommend to anyone."

15272064,346438271,2018-11-08,7175062,Marsha,"We enjoyed our stay in this beautiful old house.  Elizabeth goes out of her way to make you feel welcome, and shows you where all the amenities are.  If the weather had been better, we would have wandered around the garden.  Our only complaint is the softness of the bed, as we both prefer a firm mattress."
15272064,346769039,2018-11-09,24636235,Mark,Really cool house.  Cozy upstairs bedroom.  Definitely a great value.  I hope to stay there when I am in town again!

There were abundant pastries, fruits, and waters right outside the room and coffee and tea in the room. Very helpful when you were hungry and wanted to grab something small. The toiletries are appreciated. I was very impressed that she has shower caps and disposable makeup removers for ladies. Thank you very much!"
15272064,348169186,2018-11-12,225295554,Vikki,Beautiful house with comfortable bed and amenities. We would certainly stay there again when in Salem area. Host was welcoming and helpful.

15272064,352085914,2018-11-24,69316053,Wendy,"What a beautiful place.  Elizabeth greeted us at the door. Everything had such love in all rooms.  The bed was so comfy like it was giving you a hug with memory foam mattress and a down comforter. The shower is very tall and my husband loved it.  She had all kinds of extras in room like qtips, makeup remover. There was fruit out in Hall way and then she made homemade Apple muffins. yum. you can use the hot tub if you want. The yard is so awesome to sit and relax on if you want a fire or by the pond. We will absolutely be back."

15272064,354994156,2018-12-02,47721524,Jonathan,"Elizabeth really takes the Bed and Breakfast concept to heart! The house is stately and beautifully furnished, on a gorgeous tree-lined property.  It's like a homey getaway in the midst of a commercial area just off a major through way. Self checkin was a breeze with a digital door code. The rooms are cozy,  with a plush bed and private bath featuring plush towels and a hot shower along with plenty of shampoo, conditioner, and body gel.  But it's the little details that set this Airbnb apart; the room has a mini fridge and a microwave right inside,  with plates and silverware.  There is a Keurig machine with a generous selection including chai and hot chocolate along with bottled water. Instant oatmeal was available in the room,  and right outside,  Elizabeth provides a daily rotation of fresh fruit and home baked breads (she made banana, pumpkin, and pear breads during our 2 night stay! All were delicious). Really an above-and-beyond experience especially considering the reasonable rates. I couldn't recommend it higher."
15272064,355375239,2018-12-03,76806844,Cassie,My stay at Elizabeth’s place was excellent she was so friendly and it has everything you need. Definitely would stay again.

15272064,357594659,2018-12-10,153781977,Heidi,Elizabeth's home is beautiful and very comfortable.  We loved the freshly baked sweet breads every day!  Very nice neighborhood and an easy 10 minute drive to Willamette University.
15272064,357811922,2018-12-11,15090402,Gwen,Perfect in every way as always!
15272064,358245094,2018-12-13,209580974,Steffanie,"My wife booked this first AirBnB stay for me while on business in Salem. It proved to be a positive experience and pleasant stay. Thought I didn't cross paths with host Elizabeth while there, she has put thought/effort into the hospitality and amenities she offers."
15272064,359382180,2018-12-16,3925319,Michelle,Vista Manor was just beautiful and Elizabeth was an extraordinary hostess.  I highly recommend this booking.

15272064,360792623,2018-12-21,227556702,Raymond,"My stay was very pleasant. Everything was as advertised and I had my own room key. Elizabeth went above and beyond with little extras (including any amenity you may have forgotten to pack) and fresh baked goods and fruit. There was a Keurig (with coffee and tea), mini-fridge, microwave, and all the kitchenware you’d need to eat/drink with. I would definitely stay again.<br/><br/>While I didn’t take advantage of it, there was also a hot tub and some animal companions to keep you company if you desired."
15272064,361082355,2018-12-22,123662558,Greg,"Elizabeth is THE Rock Star of Airbnb hosts!  She met me at the door with a pleasant smile and introduction. She gave me a tour of the space made available to me in her beautiful character rich home which was built in 1923. Her place creates a warm feeling with its hardwood floors, leaded glass windows, wood moldings, and period correct furnishings incorporated into the architecture. In my large bedroom, Elizabeth showed me the refrigerator stocked with yogurt and bottled water. In a basket she had popcorn,  oatmeal and other goodies ready to bring to life in the microwave. Also available was fresh fruit and small loafs of homemade spice cake which compliment the coffee I made with the K-cup single cup coffee maker in my room.  I found the memory foam bed to be luxurious and most comfortable with its comforters. Once thoroughly informed of what was available to me, Elizabeth reminded me of the hot tub located outside in a totally private setting under the majestic evergreen trees. Before I went to bed I totally unwound and relaxed, as I enjoyed a soak in the 104 degree water. I trust your stay with Elizabeth will be as memorable as mine! Greg Smith"

Her home is sparkling clean and if you have forgotten anything, she has a basket of amenities to help. She provided fresh baked goodies, breakfast and snack items and our room even had fresh cut flowers waiting for our arrival. We didn't have time to explore her grounds, but the home is lovely and I'm sure the outside is just as welcoming and enjoyable. The home is also very convenient to many eateries and downtown. This is a jewel! I suspect we will stay here again when we visit next."

15272064,417276934,2019-02-26,15090402,Gwen,This is the best Airbnb I’ve stayed in. <br/>I’ve been there many times and it will always be my first choice on Salem
15272064,417582608,2019-02-27,2618453,Josh,"Great stay, as always"
15272064,419372012,2019-03-03,33244277,Kristen,"This is my second stay at Elizabeth’s place. Every comfort is available, and every need attended to. I will definitely stay again if I need a place in Salem."
15272064,420163085,2019-03-05,66824877,Rosa,Beautiful home and perfect room. So many added touches which I loved! Great location and value. I definitely recommend! 😊
15272064,420786641,2019-03-07,215944918,Genesis,"Elizabeth’s place was one of the best BNBs I’ve been to! From the easy check-in, quick responses, communication, and THE most comfortable bed I’ve slept in, it was all perfect!"
15272064,422290024,2019-03-10,85979192,Tara,"Vista Manor is amazing. Elizabeth had her co host take care of things, so we did not cross paths but she answered all my questions. Her place is above clean and quiet. I am working on my writing so I needed a quiet place. It was perfect. The room is cute and had ALL the amenities and then some. I will be back again."
15272064,423318183,2019-03-13,32095394,Angela,Great place! Nice extra touches. I may be back!
15272064,423615892,2019-03-14,183933479,Kimberly,"Elizabeth was a wonderful host and provided a great place for a very good price. As a woman traveling alone, I felt completely safe, and the space was quite comfortable. She had some beverages and light snacks in the room and the fresh flowers made me feel like I was at home. Very convenient location to downtown. I would highly recommend."
15272064,424386435,2019-03-16,79861145,Kent,"Elizabeth is very good and seasoned at Airbnb-ing!  I have stayed with her several times, and each time is better than the one before - she is always tweaking and improving the living arrangements!  Hot tub is a nice bonus!  The only warning I would give you is that Google Maps is funky in her area, so actually look for Vista Avenue and turn there - then Google Maps seems to recalibrate and get you there!"
15272064,426037105,2019-03-19,147436110,Pablo,Elizabeth was an amazing host. The room was clean and the bed was great. I got a great night of sleep. The location was easy to find and the house is beautiful. I know where I will stay if I am ever in the area again for work.
15272064,429372770,2019-03-27,246875716,Kelly,Great spot. Very convenient and comfortable.  Plan to stay there in the future.
15272064,433104813,2019-04-05,56646427,Laura,"Elizabeth was a big help with getting to know Salem. Her place was beautiful and she had lots of nice, personal touches. Her family members were also very helpful and polite. The location was central to everything in Salem. I would recommend this place to anyone."
15272064,435203608,2019-04-09,33458462,Carolyn,"Elizabeth is absolutely the perfect host, and her home is a wonderful place to stay!  I'm usually in the room with the queen bed, sometimes the room with the king, but this stay was different.  I had reserved the queen room, but when I showed up at 1 a.m., Elizabeth came outside to greet me--the people who had stayed there before had used lots and lots (and LOTS!) of cologne, and she wasn't sure that she'd been able to clear the room of the scent.  (I'm terribly vulnerable to migraines triggered by fragrances.)  So we checked out the room together, and after I was leery about staying there all night, she put me in the guesthouse--a much larger place with a VERY COMFORTABLE king bed and kitchen!"
15272064,436723964,2019-04-13,100063603,Shanti,"Elizabeth's antique home is clean and comfortable. She goes out of her way compared to other Airbnbs I've stayed at to provide baked goods, water, oatmeal, and fruit. There is a thermostat and heating unit in the bathroom which is also in the room so that you have control over the temperature in your space. She provided extra blankets, towels, and a Simple Human dispenser in the shower with shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. She offered access to the hot tub and the room locked from the outside with its own key. The check in was easy. The location is great, only minutes from many parks and perfect for us since we woke the next morning and headed to Albany."
15272064,437440868,2019-04-14,31688370,Greg,We would definitely stay there again:)
15272064,439284109,2019-04-18,57820866,Jeanne,"A beautiful home, both stylish and comfortable, with a kind and caring host. I felt warmly welcomed - Elizabeth really attends to detail, with everything from fresh-baked goodies and fresh fruit to a drawerful of supplies in case you forgot something! For animal lovers there's an opportunity to snuggle up to a very sweet doggie; if you don't care for animals, no worries as they are not in airbnb territory unless invited. Truly a home away from home."
15272064,441295712,2019-04-21,235328689,Ashley,Thanks for the stay! It was very lovely and accommodating! Made me and my girlfriend feel right at home. Loved that it was cable tv in the room as well and en-suite bathroom the room. Loved the window view in the bathroom as well. Close to nearby food places and Walmart.
15272064,442566262,2019-04-23,15090402,Gwen,This is the best Airbnb in Salem!
15272064,442921620,2019-04-24,36721490,William,This is a very private and comfortable room in a lovely home. Elizabeth is a warm and gracious host who has added some very thoughtful touches. Add to this the short distance to the capitol district and you have the perfect place to stay in Salem.
15272064,443294115,2019-04-25,222115190,James,"Excellent service and a beautiful place to stay, highly recommend"
15272064,446110720,2019-04-30,14469309,Fitz,Wow!  The first AirBnB that genuinely felt like a BnB.  Common areas were truly inviting.  Hot Tub! Fresh baked goods! Also close to tons of restaurants both familiar and adventurous.  I went to Venti and had a Thai peanut rice bowl with Korean BBQ tempeh.   Sure why not.
15272064,447455273,2019-05-03,102911339,Justin,Amazing place to stay. Basically like staying in a hotel with twice the amenities and little touches. Elizabeth is a great host. Highly recommend stayong here!
15272064,448956145,2019-05-05,58087684,Brenna,Perfect place to stay!
15272064,449459476,2019-05-06,40104763,Ann,We have stayed at Elizabeth’s place many times and have enjoyed each time! She is warm and friendly and her home is so cozy. The beds are wonderful.
15272064,450578994,2019-05-09,57820866,Jeanne,"I just love this beautiful home, a gorgeous Tudor style home with wood floors, oriental carpets, pretty finishing touches and a lovely shaded yard. And the many ways this host provides for guests - wow! From fresh-baked sweet breads and bottled water to all those little supplies you might suddenly find you need (from toothbrush to sewing kit, etc) - she's got you covered. Easy 2 mile trip into downtown for work. Makes my work travel so comfortable..."
15272064,451434190,2019-05-11,4057216,Meredith,"We love staying with Elizabeth. Her house is welcoming, quiet, and full of flowers and animals. When we were there were 8 ducklings that just hatched! It was the best to see them walking around. Our daughter loved it. We'll definitely be back."
15272064,452288387,2019-05-12,235023667,Cody,We came to Salem for a show at the Elsinore. Elizabeth was nothing but helpful and accommodating. The hot tub felt amazing and the property is very centrally located for all our needs. Definitely recommend.
15272064,452741724,2019-05-13,172154991,Tracy,"My daughter and I only stayed one night but I wish we could have stayed a week! Elizabeth's house is beautiful and our room was absolutely amazing. I could spend all day in her back yard. If you are an animal lover, this is the place for you. Elizabeth was an amazing host and I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Salem. I highly recommend Elizabeth's place if you need somewhere to stay in Salem."
15272064,453062362,2019-05-14,15090402,Gwen,Best place in Salem!<br/>As always everything was perfect
15272064,453789649,2019-05-16,134799166,Sungjin,It was cozy and nice! I liked that there is mini-refrigerator at the room.
15272064,456513558,2019-05-21,105367491,Sharon And Todd,"What a fun place to stay in Salem. A spread as if on a country farm, while sleeping in a well appointed and comfortable home. I especially enjoyed sitting in the hot tub toward the end of a long day."
15272064,457246894,2019-05-23,260076710,Carter,"This was my first ever Air BnB, but I have a hard time believing that anything could ever top this. Not only was Elizabeth an incredible host that prepared fresh banana bread and fruit for all her guests, but she also provided coffee, easy breakfast options, and a memory foam mattress. I slept better here than I do in my own bed. Also, the backyard is full of plants and a beautiful garden that is incredibly serene. I could not recommend this place enough!"
15272064,457702780,2019-05-24,6393277,John,"It doesn't get any better than this. Everything was really 5 star. Elisabeth met me when I arrived, showed me my very cozy room and an amazing array of little extras. I was very tired from a long day. I took an inviting shower and snuggled down among the quilts, propped up on several pillows and watched a little TV and fell fast asleep. Everything was perfect."
15272064,459788754,2019-05-27,95215310,Denise,"This is a charming, pristine clean, grand old home— wood floors, comfortable bed, a refrigerator stocked with yogurt and water bottles and a coffee maker in the room; muffins and fruit available for breakfast. Elizabeth has thought of everything a guest could possibly need.  If the weather had been nicer, we would have loved to explore her beautiful garden. This home is a rare and wonderful find... our best yet through AirBnB!  Hope to return!"
15272064,460657969,2019-05-29,57820866,Jeanne,"Such a cute, comfortable hideaway! I couldn't help but think how my kids would have loved coming here when they were small - with the pool right outside the door - and what a great romantic getaway it would make for a few days with my sweetie, exploring wine country. But in this case I was a business traveler; the peace and quiet, access to a full kitchen, and space to do my stretching / yoga were all a perfect antidote to a hard day of work."
15272064,461035821,2019-05-30,67759397,Bill,Couldn't be nicer.
15272064,463043341,2019-06-02,109184685,Deona,"Elizabeth's place is warm, inviting and so comfy.  Homey environment but plenty of privacy, too.  The perfect Airbnb."
15272064,464090725,2019-06-04,128439980,Lubor,"Probably the best accomodation I have ever visited. Equipment included in our stay: HotTube!, Cafee machine with lot of capsules for both cofee and tee, homemade bakery in the morning."
15272064,468505389,2019-06-12,48520707,Gwen,Elizabeth is a gracious host.  We were greeted at the door when we arrived and she would chat with us when we saw her and make sure we had everything we needed. The grounds are lovely with lots of trees and beautiful flowers all around.
15272064,470012457,2019-06-15,21342366,Desiree,"Elizabeth is a gracious host who excels at making her guests feel welcomed.  Charming house, warm hospitality and plenty of extra special touches make this a great place to stay!"
15272064,471575444,2019-06-17,263307484,Hollie,Elizabeth’s place is beautiful. She thought of everything in the room. I’ve never seen so much attention to detail. She responds quickly to texts and is very welcoming.
15272064,472048932,2019-06-18,10913395,Brad&Val,"This was a perfect one-night stop on our way from Tacoma to Ashland. Elizabeth has thought of everything to make a traveler's stay comfortable, including a wide variety of amenities in case anything has been forgotten.  The microwave and coffee maker in the room were just what we needed.  Lovely neighborhood with parks for walking, plenty of places to choose from for meals just a short walk from the house."
15272064,472469140,2019-06-19,17930551,Nicholas,"This retreat surprised me! Tucked just beyond a main road, the property is a relaxing escape from the bustle, while still conveniently accessing the grocery store, dispensary, restaurants, and a couple bars. Elizabeth was very welcoming provided anything I could want, and the hot tub was a perfect end to my night. Would highly recommend."
15272064,472972170,2019-06-20,57820866,Jeanne,"I love this clean, quiet, totally comfortable hideaway. With fresh fruit, eggs from the backyard chickens, and home-baked goodies waiting for me - its unbelievably welcoming."

15272064,477718992,2019-06-28,36879734,Jennifer,Elizabeth’s home is beautiful and spacious with abundant shared space. The bed is super comfortable and the space is equipped with every amenity you could want. I especially enjoyed the home baked breakfast items and Elizabeth’s thoughtfulness.
15272064,478272543,2019-06-29,257355344,Brittany,Great place to stay! Elizabeth was wonderful and her animals too. The patio/garden was great and there is a pool/hot tub :)
15272064,480945246,2019-07-03,159672765,Randall,"We had a wonderful stay at Elizabeth's place, it was above and beyond our expectations.

We also really enjoyed the hot tub and pool :)<br/>We will be back!"
15272064,482019377,2019-07-05,4474874,Barb,"We can't imagine a better spot to land in Salem.  Elizabeth's house is elegant, historic and super comfortable.  Not only was our bedroom charming and the bed really comfortable - the gardens, pool and hot tub are icing on the cake.  Enjoy the home baked breakfast goodies, fruit, yogurt, tea and coffee in one of several outdoor garden spots.  My husband loved hitting the pool for a quick dip before breakfast.  Elizabeth was wonderful about offering up walking trail and restaurant suggestions and making sure we had whatever we needed while at the same time we felt as though we had complete privacy."
15272064,483807181,2019-07-07,43383706,Mary,This was a great AirBnB experience. I would stay here again when passing though the area!
15272064,484387809,2019-07-08,142883622,Cynthia,"Would definitely recommend staying at Elizabeth's place, wonderful amenities and lovely house.  We only stayed one night which was a shame because we wanted to go in that hot tub so bad :).....Great Host!!!"

15272064,492896407,2019-07-21,38373688,Monica,"This is my second stay at Elizabeth’s house. I come down to participate in the Salem Art Fair. Elizabeth does a fantastic job making sure your stay is great, from the fresh flowers and banana bread to replenishing water bottles (much appreciated for the hot show)! Everything is very clean and comfortable. The house is located in a perfect location, including being very close to grocery stores and a Starbucks! I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here for a third time."
15272064,494690845,2019-07-24,122203600,Carrie,"What a beautiful house, great value! The bed was comfortable and anything you could need was provided. Salem was a great little town that had a little bit of everything.  If you stay and are hungry but not sure for what... look up “The Yard”."
15272064,495931689,2019-07-26,134346622,Alicia,"Great location, beautiful home and landscaping!  Elizabeth is a wonderful host, making everything comfortable and welcome.  Especially loved her banana bread pastries!  I will definitely be returning to stay here when we return!"

Also if you are in animal lover you will love this Airbnb. Since the host has a variety of pet chickens, roosters, ducks  and cats roaming outside of the property."
15272064,498447424,2019-07-29,138601112,Hong,"Even though in our short visit we did not get a chance to meet her, but we can feel her personal care for her guests in all the details. Her place is like an attraction point, so tastefully decorated with a sense of history."

Our room was so comfortable and the historical location was gorgeous! (We wished we could have used the hot tub and pool!)

There’s a huge backyard area set for relaxing and since the house is tucked in behind a huge driveway it feels like you’re no longer in the city.

15272064,544642385,2019-10-10,263532339,Jennifer,"Elizabeth’s place is truly special and I’ll be back anytime I’m needing to stay in Salem. Her home is beautiful, wonderful decor, very clean, organized, and every little detail has been thought of. There was freshly made pumpkin bread waiting for me, a stocked fridge and toiletries and literally anything I needed in my home away from home. I wasn’t expecting this high level of service. Best Airbnb experience yet."

15272064,563382315,2019-11-12,222393776,Wayne,"EXTREMELY well-maintained large home built in early 1900's.  But equipped similarly to houses built in last 10 years as it relates to amenities and bedroom/ bathroom.   Treats provided as well as freshly baked items in the morning.   Unfortunately we could stay only one night on our way from Bend visit en route to the coast.  Elizabeth is a dedicated RN, but somehow quick to respond to emails."
15272064,564021557,2019-11-14,33458462,Carolyn,"A beautiful, comfortable, room in the trees, homemade apple bread and fruit, coffeemaker, and yogurt in the room, all that, and an innkeeper meeting me at the door—what a wonderful place to stay!"

15272064,585382847,2019-12-31,2143228,Cynthia,"I really appreciate how Elizabeth attends to the tiniest details.  Warming up the room with extra heat before a guest arrives, always having cold bottled water and snacks ready and available, and the home-baked breads every morning.  The beds are so comfortable."
15272064,586385302,2020-01-01,60088911,Ray,Owe my God this was the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Loved this place I wanna go back to Salam  Oregon just to stay here again.

15272064,590469345,2020-01-08,296794161,Kimberly,I stay here often for work. The other day I had the worst headache and forgot the ibuprofen. I asked Elizabeth and of course she had plenty at the ready for her guests.
15272064,590820813,2020-01-09,56245202,Melinda,"This is a beautiful place to stay, very much a home away from home.  Elizabeth is always available, even when she is away. There are many extra touches, I loved having a packet of microwave popcorn to snack on!"
15272064,594462864,2020-01-18,85720126,Glen,"Elizabeth's is an historic house. The rooms are nicely furnished and decorated. The bedroom and bath are a little small, but adequate. Any short comings of the facility are more than made up for by the excellent hospitality by Elizabeth. Also she provides food for an in room breakfast each morning, including home made bread, fruit, yogurt, and oatmeal! Hard boil eggs upon request!.Big advantage over other AirBnBs."
15272064,595182095,2020-01-19,7186380,Paula,Great place ! We love staying here !
15272064,607460550,2020-02-17,286333900,Laurie,"Wonderful, interesting home. Elizabeth is a terrific host. Fresh fruit and homemade muffins every day are such a treat. Will definitely stay there again."

Elizabeth was headed out of town that day, so we did not meet although we spoke on the phone when I had a question,  and she was so very nice.   Check in was super easy and  I’m looking forward to staying again soon."

15272064,613813383,2020-03-02,9975830,Mary,"The ad indicates that the home is large and spacious.  It does not indicate that the house and bedrooms are rented to others, and in fact, during our stay it seemed as if all bedrooms and guest quarters were full.  We would not have rented the room if we knew that we would be sharing space with others, outside of the host.  The ad should state the maximum renters that one would encounter should they decide to rent the space."
15272064,616119968,2020-03-08,252231934,Estrellita,"Elizabeth provides a comfortable and warm place to stay.  She provides so much from all the toiletries you could possibly need to a microwave oven, personal refrigerator, dishes, utensils, etc.  There is coffee and tea in your room and fresh baked quick bread, fruit, water and extra coffee, etc in the hallway.  The refrigerator is stocked with yogurts and water and there is oatmeal and popcorn provided as well.  The rooms are very clean.  I love the sitting area where there is a fireplace and a wine bar with comfortable seating.  I sat there for a while one evening sipping on Irish cream and just enjoying the relaxing atmosphere.  This is all so amazing for the price.  What a great value.  What a great place to stay."

15272064,623096013,2020-04-25,275412487,Gil,I would have a hard time finding another Airbnb with so much value. One of the best hosts ever! Liked it so much added another day.

15272064,626696135,2020-05-29,223804909,Rob,"Elizabeth was the consummate host. Her home was in the heart of Salem, in a peaceful relaxing setting.  The attention to detail was superb, and she made both myself and my paw child welcome.  The amenities, snacks, and beverages far surpassed a hotel environment. The bed was luxurious and very inviting. The value, location, and overall experience was stellar. I would go out of my way to stay in this lovely home again."

There were fresh flowers everywhere.  Coffee machine, fridge, microwave too. It is very clean. Elizabeth provides fresh fruit and snacks. She even offered me a glass of wine from bar in the living room. The bed in my room was a little saggy but otherwise its an amazing value!!!  There are pets on the property so this would not be a good fit for those with allergies or dislike of pets. Thank you Elizabeth."
15272064,630606856,2020-06-19,326529408,Jeff,"Such a great space and the host is superb! They have really put effort into thinking of what a guest would like.

A warm greeting,  a tour around her lovely home. And also don't forget your swim clothes.  Take a dip in the pool or relax in the hot tub.  Our room,  room #1 was beautifully styled and super comphy to be in. Slept so good we thought we were home in the mountains of Washington State and not in the middle of Salem.  I highly recommend that you stay a night or even 2. <br/>I know we plan on coming back."

Please stay here! It was great."

Quiet and relaxing, in a great neighborhood, I loved my morning walks and enjoying coffee in the garden while observing the many birds that visited it along with a friendly squirrel or two.  The tasty baked goods provided daily were a nice touch.  Highly recommend!"
15272064,662187523,2020-09-08,6998671,Jeff,An attractive large house maybe a mansion or former hotel and a host that adds a personal touch to make you feel welcome

Although the room was small, it had all the necessary amenities including a smart TV, Keurig coffee maker, and mini fridge. The bed was on the soft side but quite comfortable. There were plenty of blankets and towels, and she provides basics like shampoo, conditioner and body wash. There is also a blow dryer so no need to pack your own. We appreciated the snacks and bottled water provided both in the room and common area. Overall an excellent value. I look forward to staying here  the time I'min Salem."

Her rooms are always clean and well kept.<br/>For those of you who are looking for a home far away from your house; this home is perfect. The location is great for business people and those who just want to visit Salem.<br/>I look forward to staying in that home again.

Elizabeth ran circles to make sure I could stay in an emergency and really saved me when I needed a restful place to stay again. My second time therewas as great as my first! Oh yeah, and the 2 sweet kitties who greeted me regularly were a delightful bonus!"
15272064,723744673,2021-01-11,5968852,Gina,"Elizabeth made the entire process very easy, I arrived very late in the evening which wasnt a problem and the peacock room was perfectly equipped with its own bathroom. There were also some fruit, snacks, mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker... was a great stay. thank you!"
15272064,723909116,2021-01-12,3246625,Laura,"I wasn't sure what to expect with staying at Elizabeth's around the whole covid thing - whether there would be adequate social distancing, how busy common areas would be, etc.  Once I arrived, I was so positively impressed with the setup of the space that I was able to completely relax and enjoy.  And it seems every little detail was thoughtfully anticipated and arranged, from needle and thread to fresh fruit and bottled water.  I wanted to stay an extra day just to feel so pampered!"
15272064,724220293,2021-01-14,121765242,James,"places like Elizabeth's are my favorite thing about using airbnb :) that's how even if ur visit is like mine was: walk into your room, shower, sleep & leave after waking & a quick breakfast, they're often as delightful as they are unique!<br/><br/>the house itself looked like a living museum or set of a period piece it was simply breathtaking as was the entire experience of taking in the property when i finally saw it by daylight as i left<br/><br/>and not that the room wasn't great... on the contrary, i thought the room would have been a steal simply on it's own merit even if it were simply in a more uniform house in a neat & manicured suburb somewhere <br/><br/>its a self contained space up the foyer stair containing every amenity quality hotels offer: fridge, microwave, attractive basic set of dining flatware & utensils, light food & drinks laid out and comfy seating <br/><br/>private bathroom with a shower & some vanity space (with ample vanity in the bedroom)<br/><br/>the decor throughout is gorgeous i simply wont try & do it justice with a review but suffice 2 say, a tour of the house & grounds alone would nearly be worth what is asked 4 the stay lol<br/><br/>i was coming off of 12 hours driving continuing on in the morning & had picked the space while stopped for a short coffee break simply based on location, price & aesthetic but, as i said, got another one of several surprise destinations i hope 2 revisit one day soon :)"
15272064,725351063,2021-01-18,188717473,Patrick,Great value and location.

15272064,732434972,2021-02-18,6795482,Kate,"Elizabeth puts her heart and soul into making Vista Manor friendly, comfortable, and beautiful. This, our second visit, was just as wonderful as our first, last year. We brought our dog, Nora, who also loves the house and grounds. This time, Mother Nature interfered with our fun, dumping an ice storm on Salem, cutting off power and light and knocking down trees. Elizabeth rose to the challenge, providing extra blankets, candles, lanterns, and her usual cheerful attitude. It was an adventure! Vista Manor is a lovely historical home, and to be a guest there is something very special. We hope to visit again before too long."
15272064,733430058,2021-02-21,53640973,Benjamin,"I just staid for a 1-night stay. Elizabeth responded to all of my questions promptly. Spent some time in the hot tub, was overall a REALLY good experience! Would recommend, this host..."
15272064,735518223,2021-02-28,148552980,Taylor,I stayed at Elizabeth’s place while working as a travel nurse in town. It was so nice and comfortable to come home to after a long shift. I felt safe there and wish I could’ve stayed longer!

15272064,743676370,2021-03-29,40104763,Ann,We have been staying with Elizabeth for years. Every time we come it’s like coming “home.” She is our favorite Air B n B host. Our last daughter is graduating from college in Salem and we will miss our frequent visits to this Air B n B.

I had the peacock room - lovely private bath and lots of amenities - snacks and coffee and tea in the room and more goodies and fruit out in the open hallway.  She makes everything you could need for business or vacation trip available - envelopes, scissors, pen and a notebook on your desk as an example. The house is surrounded by trees  and flowers too. Highly recommend."

It is homey, comfortable, stocked with snacks and amenities. We sat on the back patio surrounded by beautiful plants and felt like we were out of the city when, in fact, we were smack dab in it. Definitely recommend!"

We were delighted at everything that was stated and pictured but it was MUCH better than the photos. From the get go- Elizabeth was a  11/10 with communication, attention to detail, comfy bed, cleanliness, hot tub, snacks! And the animals- Mr. Rabbit , hens, duck and cats in a beautiful yard to match the storybook house! Thank you Elizabeth for sharing your home and hospitality! You are one of the best!"

It was so nice being able to use different rooms throughout the house and the gardens are beautiful.  It could be a little tricky getting suitcases up the stairs,  but I noticed they have a rental on the first floor, too.  We felt very welcomed and appreciated the amount of detail the hosts take to make their guests feel comfortable.  Elizabeth’s house is beautiful!"

Your room has a split unit in it and it keeps it cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Every time I go they have added something new. They are constantly working on the property. I am definitely a repeat customer! Will be back at Christmas time.

15272064,406489561653296360,2021-07-14,999879,Patricia,"We stayed for two nights in the Peacock Room at the magnificent Vista Manor -- wow, what a stunning old home and property.  It was our first visit to Salem and we could not have found a better host and accommodation.  Elizabeth is very pleasant and warm and welcoming.  From the outset, she was happy to accommodate us.  Our room was very comfortable, beautifully appointed, quiet and pleasantly cool thanks to the air conditioning.  The living room and study are spacious and beautiful too.  We had access to her private backyard and refreshing inground pool.  It turned our visit into a wonderful summer stay.  We only wished that we could have stayed longer!  We highly recommend the Vista Manor..."
15272064,407972330028984627,2021-07-16,215735044,Chris,"This is an amazing place!  Very large beautiful home in a residential neighborhood, but just a block or two from Commercial Street and it’s a short convenient drive to downtown.  Plenty of off-street parking, too.  I was lucky enough to stay in the Peacock Room and it was amazing—complete attention to detail, decor, and great amenities.  Air conditioning, too.  Quiet neighborhood—I slept like a rock.  Highly recommend!"
15272064,408662703643209560,2021-07-17,374219209,Jennifer,"Have stayed with Elizabeth several times now. First time in the Peacock room! Small but fully stocked room just like the others. Private bathroom, comfy bed, WiFi works! I love staying at Vista Manor!"
15272064,414527856693002257,2021-07-25,399753812,Christopher And Olivia,"Easily the best Airbnb stay I have ever experienced! Elizabeth was a very welcoming host, check-in was very straightforward, and even though other guests stay in the manor in other rooms, I never felt like my privacy was intruded on. If I am ever in the Salem area again, I am definitely staying at Vista Manor!"
15272064,416736678475011768,2021-07-28,345848621,Lisa,Classic home with an amazing yard to relax in. Lots of attention from the pets. The chickens like to be pet and the cats and dog love to be loved!

I was only there briefly for one night, but it was a really cute and clean place with a lot of thoughtful touches. the air conditioner above the bed was awesome, the snacks, and the emergency toiletries were really nice touches. the bed was incredibly soft and the theme of the room was fun. everything seemed very, very clean. I was very comfortable. when I ran into an issue with the wifi, Elizabeth quickly responded and helped me out. the home itself is beautiful in a quiet location. I'd recommend this stay!"
15272064,420325051458266009,2021-08-02,183242127,Rena,"This is an amazing historical house that is beautifully furnished and taken care of, and the outside grounds are also beautiful.  The room was decorated with period pieces, but also has a highly functional bathroom, with reproduction fixtures.  Even though the room was fairly small, it was well appointed  with amenities, using the space very efficiently.  Next time we will have more than 1 night!"
15272064,420994215939973437,2021-08-03,103057467,Yvonne,Great place to stay. A/C works great. She was so nice and had some snacks for me. The room was clean and has everything you need for a hood stay.

Everything was so professional with snacks, and the fridge and microwave in the room is  next level stuff!! She had shampoo conditioner and soap in the dispenser in the shower, it was very cool. The house was quiet and available to anyone who has a room, and so is the pool and hot tub. What a lovely experience and what a great peacock room theme!!!"
15272064,426098097449439660,2021-08-10,369457627,Joseph,I have stayed at Elizabeth home several times now. One of my best Airbnb in the valley. Okay; it depends on what you are looking for. The home is clean; the host is great in communicating and assisting if you need help. You are close to convenient stores too. The bed is for sure comfortable and the room is private. I plan to stay at Elizabeth home on my next trip to the Valley.

Upon unlocking the door, I was greeted and shown to my room. There was an explanation of where water and treats were, etc. and it was just such a nice, warm welcome into the home. I stayed in the Peacock room and it was really cute!"

Perfect if you are on the road for a while. I appreciated the guide book.  The hot tub was excellent. This was a true bed and breakfast experience, unlike what other AirBnb's offer."
15272064,434046017306152799,2021-08-21,116564664,Victoria,"Look no further, this is one of the best places to stay in Salem! We enjoyed a walk to a nearby park and a restaurant. We brought back takeout for dinner because the outdoor patio was such a nice setting, complete with friendly cats, bunny, and chicken. We slept well in our quiet room and super cushy bed."
15272064,434796738641107959,2021-08-22,23594440,Karen,Elizabeth is very responsive and flexible. Lots of little extras. We enjoyed our stay and loved the pool.

It’s my home away from home when visiting my daughter who attends Willamette University,  and I would never stay anywhere else!"
15272064,436966012535492853,2021-08-25,369457627,Joseph,Great home; clean room and very convenient to those travelers on business trips or vacationing.

The house is just drop dead gorgeous and the peacock bedroom is so fun,  cozy, and efficiently stocked with everything you could need. The bed was also extremely comfortable. I unfortunately didn’t actually get to meet Elizabeth but she was very communicative and kind. I will definitely be staying here again if I visit Salem again."
15272064,440612220892695819,2021-08-30,419792303,Lori,"House built in the 30s with all the 30s charm. Very very well-maintained. Pool and hot tub was a great bonus. Don’t think that you can find another Airbnb that could match this one. We had a great time we will definitely come back if we get this way again.  The hosts attention to detail in anticipating any needs was superb..  There were four rooms on the upper floor being rented out. All were occupied when we stayed but we barely heard anyone. Everyone seem to be very courteous. We had room number one and it had its own bathroom, all rooms have themes to them. Room number one was peacocks. Which is really cute the way she had it decorated. She provided homemade zucchini bread and we had items in the room to have breakfast as well as water, snacks and coffee,"

I stayed in the Peacock room and it was lovely. Elizabeth was very accommodating and kind. She provides guests with everything you could possibly need. I look forward to saying again soon.

I was out most of the time but enjoyed starting the day with the fruit and yogurt Elizabeth provides. The notebook with suggested restaurants & hikes and the history of the house was a nice touch."

Luckily, Elizabeth’s upstairs room (Peacock Room) was available and it fit us perfectly. Elizabeth has quite the setup in such a lovely area. The room has everything a roving couple needs: tv to catchup, SNACKS, fridge so our fruit and snacks don’t go bad, comfy bed with clean sheets and multiple pillows (I myself can’t sleep without two and so many AIRBNBs only ever come with two!), and a bathroom with endless travel necessities (lots of shampoo, conditioner, soap, toothpaste, and lotions). <br/><br/>Highly recommend!"

Vista Manor is a charming old home that has retained the unique aspects of original construction that immediately made me fall in love with the place. <br/>The location is also ideal - very close to shopping and dining options, yet far enough off the main road that you feel you’re in an quiet country manor. <br/>Apart from the charm, I think what impressed me most was the host’s attentive service at all levels to make one’s stay as comfortable as possible. Anything you might need for your stay has been considered. I truly felt at home during my time there, and if I’m in the area again I will definitely stay at Vista Manor."

This was also the best stocked Airbnb I’ve EVER stayed at, and Elizabeth has gone above and beyond to make sure you have what you need.

Elizabeth has obviously given a lot of thought to the needs of a guest. She's a very pleasant, attentive, and forthcoming host. The room itself is nicely decorated with bright colors, and the shiny turquoise ceramic tile on the attached bathroom floor is gorgeous. Plenty of snacks, yogurt and coffee in the room, with details on how to find more of everything on the landing. It was a relaxing and quiet mini-vacation, and Elizabeth made it so."

Forgot to pay attention to the picture she posted of the entrance!  Beautiful building!  Clean rooms that are all different and have a theme!  We were in the Peacock Room!  It's small, definitely for 1-2 people and not too much luggage.  Lots of hooks for hanging coats, towels, purses, etc. The living room made me think of going to visit my grandma!  Great place to stay and we would return!"

Cleanliness, prices, hospitality, value, decor, and extras make this a BNB we will come back to often. Elizabeth is just lovely as a hostess and her helper Sylvia is the best. It is an older home with all the personality that comes with that. The rooms are beautifully appointed, cozy, clean, and comfy.<br/>Just 30 minutes from the annual tulip festival and all that Oregon's wine country has to offer, you owe it to yourself to stay here. We'll be back next year for some R&R!"

The room has adjustable heat and was comfy for my grandma who gets cold easily. The bed was comfy for us and the decor is fun and tasteful.
15272064,608006120949256837,2022-04-18,32931663,Angela,"What a wonderful, inviting and very clean place Elizabeth has to offer a traveler! hands down she has the best guest book I have ever seen in over 35 Airbnb's I've stayed in. The bed was perfectly comfortable as well as heating and air cooling options that were whisper-quiet. All the accoutrements to offer including breakfast options as well as coffee and tea, cold water and necessary shower items. I would most certainly return for the above reasons; as well as to go into the backyard and hop in the pool!"

She was very responsive when I had questions about the check-in, etc.  There were lots of extras that I wouldn't expect to find in a hotel room it was like sleeping at home.  I met an older couple who were also guests and they were very nice folks (there were 3 rooms for guests).  I will definitely be looking her up again next time I'm in town!  Thank you for the great stay, Elizabeth!"

If you forget some shampoo or toothpaste or a toothbrush don’t worry she has it. The room was beautiful we stayed in the Peacock room. It was so nice to have our own bathroom right there. She even checked on us since there have been some fires in the area to make sure that we didn’t need anything and that our wedding was not canceled that we were attending. Thank you Elizabeth you are amazing!!

We were concerned at first that it may be a little far from campus, but we found it very convenient -- only about a 7-minute drive from our daughter's dorm. In addition, I was pleased to see that we could walk to a few restaurants, a grocery, and even a medical clinic within just a couple of minutes, and Trader Joe's is only a mile down the road.<br/><br/>The room and bathroom were very spacious and comfortable, and the bed was wonderful. In the bathroom, Elizabeth had provided everything we needed as far as amenities, toiletries, and plenty of clean towels and washcloths. The hot water in the shower was a little tricky to adjust for the first few minutes, but it turned out to be fine. We enjoyed the huge closet with plenty of space to hang our clothes. In addition, the room felt very private, with trees right outside the windows. It was a very cozy space on the rainy days and nights, and on our last day, the sun came out and provided a beautiful view."

The manor is beautiful, the room fantastic (my room had a fireplace with a morning view of the mountain), a separate private bath with claw tub, and a kitchenette stocked with snacks and breakfast food that was just what I needed when I arrived.  Her place is like a beautiful zen garden nestled in the middle of the city (a very rare find). Elizabeth is very kind, very thoughtful and a great communicator.  She took time out of a very busy day to make sure I knew how to find her place.  When I arrived she and her family made me feel very much at home. "
15815105,145343439,2017-04-17,16238488,Michael,"Elizabeth's place is a wonderful stop for a great rest. And she pays great attention to detail, very welcoming, and make sure that you're well taken care of when you arrive. She's very friendly and has a great sense of humor. Her house is a classic for sure, from the 1920s, but kept up beautifully. There are many mature plants and trees around the grounds, and the atmosphere she has created is warm and festive. Highly recommended."
15815105,145748296,2017-04-19,18355117,Bence,"Elizabeth's home is gorgeous!  Our room was huge, with a fireplace and big, beautiful bathroom.  We didn't want to leave after just one night!  Elizabeth provides more than the average airbnb.  We had coffee, water, snacks, fruit, yogurt, and even an in-room fridge and microwave.  She also provided a log so that we could enjoy the fireplace.  An in-room TV was another added bonus.  We will be recommending this site to friends who are going to be in the area, and would stay again in a heartbeat.  We had a top-notch experience."
15815105,145944324,2017-04-20,126315234,Meredith,"What a spectacular location, home, and host!"

15815105,147272175,2017-04-25,6899209,Kathleen,"We loved it!  The room was huge and beautiful - king bed (so comfy), fireplace, big bathroom, great view of the gardens around the house - front, back and side too.  The whole house was really a special place and close to town, but completely quiet.  We'd stay again in a heartbeat if we come back to Salem."
15815105,148026401,2017-04-29,3053884,Jane,"Another great stay at Elizabeth's. The larger room is beautiful, spacious, and extremely comfortable. I love staying here."

15815105,152663210,2017-05-17,3053884,Jane,"Elizabeth's place is my favorite place to stay when I travel to Salem for business. Either room has everything I need, and is extremely comfortable. She is a welcoming and communicative host."
15815105,156454663,2017-05-30,115188265,George,"Seriously lovely home, most gracious owner/hostess,  perfect location for us - definitely will return"
15815105,157142258,2017-06-02,1919417,Steven,"In my decades of very frequent personal and business travel, domestically and internationally, with accommodations in everything from tiny backpacking tents to luxury resorts, Elizabeth's house stands out as one of the best values and most private and comfortable stays that I have experienced!<br/><br/>The house is a recently-restored historical property set back from the street and hidden from view from all directions by its lush grounds that ensure quiet and privacy. My room was enormous. The closet was large enough to serve as a bedroom. The entrance so large, it contained the breakfast and snack items (i.e., refrigerator, coffee maker, hot water heater, fruit, oatmeal, yoghurt, etc.)<br/><br/>I was traveling on business. A well-lit built-in desk facilitated work. Another table was available for meals. The bed was very comfortable. I think it had a memory foam mattress cover.<br/><br/>The grounds are being rescued from decades of neglect, but already attractive and interesting. They include a swimming pool, greenhouse, chickens, and a duck. There are several affectionate cats in the house. I found these animals amusing and delightful. Once the landscaping is completed, this property will be even better than I've described.<br/><br/>I feel it was a near miracle that a vacancy was available when I needed it. My only regret was that I had to leave."
15815105,157397321,2017-06-03,104856837,Rob,Very quaint and comfortable room in a very large house/estate.  Host Elizabeth was very helpful and informative. Perfect location. Bed was comfortable too.  Cloe the dog . . .nice little greeter.  Shower pressure was weak. We'd stay again!

15815105,172101920,2017-07-19,33324126,David,"Elizabeth has a spacious, comfortable home that is very well supplied with anything a traveler might need.  GREAT location for a Willamette Valley drive or sipping tour, or a hike in Silver Falls State Park, both of which are close-by. Communication was excellent and responses prompt.  Room was large and very clean.  Bananas, apples, coffee maker in room.  Bed was extremely comfortable.<br/>    The arrangements, stay, and departure were all very easy.   Great place!"

The home is beautiful and the room comes stocked with everything you need! It is spacious and would be great for a long term stay. The yard is a wonderful sight and all the animals give it the perfect ""home"" feeling. I look forward to returning!"
15815105,175767957,2017-07-29,53073139,Monica,"Elizabeth was very accommodating. She helped me to get situated with a last minute, late night booking.

15815105,180598261,2017-08-10,141360763,Charles,Elizabeth has done wonders in restoring this grand old home.  My stay was most enjoyable.  Its location makes getting to all points in Salem and the surrounding communities quick and easy.
15815105,183259243,2017-08-16,2642377,Mariella,Very nice room and very helpfull<br/>Guest. <br/>Il soggiorno da Elisabeth è stato molto piacevole e rilassante. La camera è veramente grande e <br/>ben arredata. Mio marito ed io abbiamo trascorso due giorni immersi nella natura e nella tranquillità. Molto disponibile la nostra host e molto simpatico il micio Newton che al mattino è venuto a darci il buongiorno . <br/>Luogo consigliatissimo  ....
15815105,183988911,2017-08-18,1400339,Mia,Awesome home and full of character. Wonderful master sweet. Elizabeth is making the most of this property and you will enjoy the lovely  manor feel to this stay. Great value for the price and much comfort. A grand stay.
15815105,184476233,2017-08-19,93957222,Christopher,"If I could give this place 10 stars I would, amazing home and wonderful host"

The eclipse was all we had hoped for and then some! Our stay with you was so nice. Very comfortable and enjoyable.Thank you so much for your wonderful hospitality! :) We hope to see you again...
15815105,186182540,2017-08-23,28533058,Tiffany,Lovely space. Large room with private bath. Would stay here again in a minute!
15815105,186873802,2017-08-25,823958,Jessica,"This is a great value and was a very, very nice room! We really appreciated the fruit, yogurt and coffee in the morning too. This room has a private bathroom with a clawfoot tub/shower combo. Lovely property and cute cats outside. This is a historic home so bring earplugs as there are other folks in the house as well. We were awakened and kept awake by a man intermittently shouting between 1 and 2am. This was rough given we were getting up early the next day. The host was very kind and allowed us a late check-out so we got to nap before leaving after our early morning adventure. Would recommend to other travelers."
15815105,189397009,2017-09-01,120799815,Deborah,"Great old home very close to Commercial St. The room had everything you could need including a mini refrigerator with fruit, yogurt, oatmeal packets, coffee and tea. Elisabeth was great host. This was our first airbnb experience and I much preferred it to the hotel we usually use. We'll be back next visit to Salem."
15815105,189745261,2017-09-02,39294415,Mary,"Elizabeth's home is incredibly beautiful with a lovely master suite. We felt welcome and well cared for, check in was seamless, the hot tub was wonderful after a day of travel. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique and personal place to stay!"
15815105,190269292,2017-09-03,5655321,Nadia,"Elizabeth's place was perfect! Easily one of the best Airbnbs I've stayed at. Her home is incredibly charming, and you could really sense the level of care and detail she put in to making the experience comfortable, from the quality of the bedding, to the mini kitchen stocked with water, snacks, and coffee/tea located in the bedroom hallway. The room did get a little stuffy being it was a top floor unit on a weekend of 100 degree weather when we stayed, but that was minor. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Salem!"
15815105,191250963,2017-09-06,73597001,Manny,Elizabeth and her family were extremely nice.
15815105,192621918,2017-09-10,115010064,Mike,"A great place to stay when visiting Salem.  Well located to be close to everything, yet hidden away as a quiet retreat."
15815105,192998558,2017-09-11,22221362,Gilly,"Wonderful home, very quant. Very kind and made sure I felt right at home. I have two dogs traveling with me and she was very warm and welcoming on having them in her home."
15815105,194869120,2017-09-17,6544327,Rhonda,Elizabeth is a great hostess!
15815105,195306963,2017-09-18,49673142,Dave & Heather,"Worth every cent. This home is cozy and Elizabeth works very hard to make the home yours. It is a rather large home - but has a personal feel.  The property is on an acre in the city -  but is blessed with chickens, ducks, turtles, awesome sitting nooks and beautiful landscaping... Although the residence is near all modern amenities, it is so very quiet. No security issues at all. We felt safe, welcomed and treated like family. We travel to Salem often and will stay again."
15815105,196033497,2017-09-21,77582845,Richard,"Lovely 1920’s era home with very personable host (Elizabeth). Some genteel repair work being done while we were there.  Not a walking neighborhood but only a 10-minute drive to downtown. We had a nice, large room with refrigerator, microwave, TV, king-size bed with generous comforters and numerous pillows. Private bathroom with some remodeling being completed."
15815105,197765458,2017-09-26,50824412,Yoha,"Elizabeth's has been the BEST AirBnb experience ever!! The house is beautiful with lush garden all around, really pretty! And it's located in such a nice neighborhood. I spent a week here without a car and was able to walk to everything- nice restaurants, groceries, shopping. While at the same time, it's secluded well enough up a small hill, so plenty of privacy and no noise from roads.  The room itself is large, with beautiful view, large closet space, comfy bed, nice private bathroom, comes with a mini fridges, coffee maker, kettle, and so many more. Elizabeth is a wonderful human being, she takes such special care of her guests. She made me feel welcome form the get go, and even offered to pick me up from train station and helped me get acquainted with the place. I wont stay anywhere else when in Salem!"
15815105,198828152,2017-09-30,40104763,Ann,We loved Elizabeth's place. It was huge and so unique! We could have stayed in that big comfy bed all day. Can't wait to come back in two weeks and try out the hot tub.
15815105,200820425,2017-10-06,27220993,Chris,"Elizabeth is a gracious host and her place is outstanding in every way. The large room is beautiful and includes every amenity--2 comfortable chairs by the fireplace, private bath, desk, table and chairs, refrigerator, microwave, coffee pot, coffee, tea, snacks, comfy bed. You will love Elizabeth's place!"
15815105,201683782,2017-10-08,84015043,Lynne,"It is a lovely home and the room was large, with a lovely private full bath and a mini ""kitchen."" Elizabeth was a fabulous host and went out of her way to serve us. The location was very convenient for our trip to  Willamette Univ.  We would highly recommend a stay there"

We loved the wonderful large bedroom and king size bed. This room has a private large bathroom too. There is a fireplace and sitting area, along with an area for a small refrigerator, coffee pot, and microwave. Elizabeth had fruit and other snacks waiting for us in the room. I loved that there was cold water and yogurt in the refrigerator. Elizabeth checked in with us every day to make sure we had everything we needed."
15815105,206506968,2017-10-25,8564024,Cynthia,"I stayed in the largest room this time.  A spectacular suite with kitchen and dining area; charming bathroom with enormous pedestal sink, claw foot tub and stained glass window; sunrise view over westward hills; fireplace with side chairs; very comfortable King bed.   Just a quick overnight at work, but this felt like a get-away."
15815105,208720454,2017-11-02,156109511,Stephanie,Elizabeth's home is very welcoming and lovely!  The room was beautiful and very comfortable.  She is a wonderful hostess and we look forward to returning.
15815105,209210147,2017-11-04,40104763,Ann,Elizabeth's place is amazingly comfortable and full of amenities. We come to Salem often and will always stay here if it is available. The only problem is we have a really hard time getting out of that incredible king size bed. It is too cozy!!! We also love that our little dog is welcome.
15815105,209713050,2017-11-05,83974694,Rachel,Great stay! Couldn't ask for a better Airbnb experience.
15815105,211365865,2017-11-12,41120039,Stephanie,"Vista Manor and Elizabeth are a treasure to be sure! This was our second getaway at this Airbnb. We will keep coming back. Elizabeth is so warm and welcoming and her house is beautiful and yet comfortable. We couldn’t ask for more. From the sweet touches (flowers) to the thoughtful amenities, she’s thought of it all. You won’t be sorry."
15815105,211860711,2017-11-14,20204748,Susan,"Such a beautiful house, large and comfortable bedroom/bathoom, and pleasant host."
15815105,212016384,2017-11-15,106418400,Debbie,"What a dream stay! My first airbnb experience and it was fabulous! I thought the photos were too good to be true (especially for the price), but it was everything and more! The location is wonderful...right off a main street where there were restaurants, grocery store, etc, and Elizabeth had some great tips on local places. I was in room 4 and it was so spacious and had everything you'd ever need with large, comfy bed, small fridge, microwave, food, all amenities! The clawfoot tub was marvelous to soak in and the fireplace with a starter log was perfect!  There is even a pool and hot tub during the summer! Less expensive than any local hotel, and soooo much better!  I would highly recommend this!"
15815105,213046489,2017-11-19,83974694,Rachel,Another great stay.
15815105,214353421,2017-11-25,115010064,Mike,This was the latest of several times staying at Elizabeth’s place.  It’s a great location for us and we see upgrades she is making with each new stay.  A great value in Salem.

15815105,220761849,2017-12-23,22996821,Katie,"Thank you so much for the stay. It gave us a great break off the road, and let us recharge and prepare for our holiday trip. <br/><br/>The bed was incredible. Wish we had more time there to make use of the fireplace & the bathtub. The closet was about as big as our first apartment, and had better views than it. Everything we've ever dared dream to have in a master suite.<br/><br/>And the local donut shop we found down the street was tasty. Ideal way to start back on the road.<br/><br/>Once again, thank you!"
15815105,220971359,2017-12-24,92860368,Somal,Great Stay and location. Elizabeth is great host too. Amenities were more than expected or desired in an AirBnb stay.

15815105,226820747,2018-01-12,20204748,Susan,"This place is even better than the listing can convey. It is perfectly located: in a quiet and pretty residential neighborhood, but literally a block and a half from a street with lots of restaurants and things to do. It is perfectly located and beautiful inside and out. I would offer to buy this house, if I moved to Salem. <br/><br/>Elizabeth is an excellent host. She wants to be helpful, though I rarely need any help. She gave me a good restaurant tip last visit. She also has everything you need and more at your fingertips. A little basket of items in case you forgot to pack something. Every detail is thought through. Everything about the stay is perfectly convenient. This is my preferred place to stay when I go to Salem."
15815105,229449548,2018-01-23,150616571,Christiana,"Kind, caring and any need fulfilled for our room.  We were a bit cold, coming from southern California.  She immediately gave us a space heater which saved us for the following nights before bed. "
15815105,230229143,2018-01-27,23188025,Heather,"The manor is lovely, and we'll stay again on our next visit to the Salem area. The room was elegant, and offered every amenity. The king bed was super cozy, and I slept like a baby. Elizabeth and her dog Chloe are a delight as hostesses."
15815105,233231575,2018-02-08,3709146,Joy,Staying at Vista Manor is like staying in an English country manor.  The location is wonderful (very easy access to downtown Salem) and the home is lovely.  We enjoyed every minute of our stay.

15815105,238971918,2018-02-27,33458462,Carolyn,"I hate to check “much better than expected” because I expected it to be wonderful and it was – Elizabeth goes above and beyond every time, and we always feel welcomed."
15815105,239443733,2018-03-01,869605,Danny,Very comfy ensuite room with nice amenities.  Quiet and quaint.   Nice place to stay and close to downtown.

15815105,263325116,2018-05-11,14864925,Arlene,"The home is in forest and ten minutes from downtown.  The home is centrally located for my business trip.<br/><br/>The large room is upstairs.  There are four bedrooms upstairs.   There maybe other guests during your stay.<br/><br/>Elizabeth provides breakfast items, fruit, oatmeal.  I liked that room had microwave, refrigerator, and coffee maker.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The hot water ran out during my shower."
15815105,264760727,2018-05-14,3940843,Gemma,What a magical weekend! Our family rented rooms with Elizabeth to be together for our daughter's graduation from Willamette. Elizabeth worked so hard on our behalf - fresh flowers everywhere; chairs circled about in her glorious back patio so we could gather there with family and enjoy one another; generous fruit bowls and breakfast items in each room; and ample off-street parking. We all loved the elegant living room with antique furniture and wood fire to gather before in the evening. Staying at Vista Manor felt like visiting family and we are forever grateful to Elizabeth for hosting our family gathering.
15815105,265612470,2018-05-17,1531140,Jordan,Amazing place. Very tasteful.

15815105,269037721,2018-05-26,5113993,Matteo,"This was one of the best Airbnb we’ve ever been! The location is beautiful, surrounded by nature but literally 4 min walk from restaurants and shops. It’s also 10 min drive from a bunch of wineries! The room we stayed in was huge, the bed was very comfy and the private bathroom was big and clean as well. It was like a little apartment. Elizabeth is a fantastic host! She made us delicious empanadas and she gave us a lift to one of the winery and showed us around. Fantastic experience and highly recommended!!"
15815105,270314449,2018-05-28,191038546,Thomas,"Beautiful home, a gracious host, and amazing amenities to boot. Would book again with Elizabeth in a heartbeat. Can’t recommend enough!"

Lots of food choices nearby as well.   Elizabeth is very helpful with anything you might need-like freezer space !!  "
15815105,275324020,2018-06-10,21684387,Zachary,Completely tasteful and period-appropriate decoration for her house. The pictures belie the beauty within!

15815105,278323845,2018-06-17,113232417,Douglas,"Wonderful wonderful Airbnb.. huge spacious room with so many special thoughts. This place is a super host Airbnb but goes beyond it.  We did not meet the host but her son was there to greet us and did everything to welcome us.  Very nice young adult.   Elizabeth also had wine to welcome guests, we never saw that before and best thing ever to have a wine after a long drive. This Airbnb also has a hot tub and a pool and such a beautiful garden area to hang out. We were hoping to extend our stay but sadly it was already booked.<br/>Elizabeth is extremely prompt to respond, within minutes.  Communication was excellent <br/><br/>We definitely will return to this Airbnb..one of the best place we have been"
15815105,280204838,2018-06-22,29711222,Lorinda,Enjoyed our stay and appreciated all the extras.
15815105,280640350,2018-06-23,24837886,Bonnie,A terrific value!  Room 4 is spacious and dripping with country charm. The windows and cool Oregon breezes will feed your soul.  Host was out of town but communicated with us continuously as needed.  Comfy bed. Great rest!
15815105,281406088,2018-06-24,184034899,John,"Don’t even bother looking elsewhere, you won’t find a better place to stay."
15815105,284567505,2018-07-01,23291542,Lore,"I stayed at Elizabeth's place while I was in town for an event.  I never met the host, but I left early and returned mid-evening, so wasn't there much.  The room was comfortable and it was nice to have the ensuite bathroom.  The pool was not available for use and looked like it had been in disrepair for some time."
15815105,288820576,2018-07-10,102541082,Tom,This is a charming bit of old England in the middle of Salem OR. It's a great location and a good value.  We will be back.
15815105,292314503,2018-07-17,139328462,Matthew,"Elizabeth made sure that we had everything that we needed including setting up another room for us when we had extra family come into Salem.  Room #2 was made available with our reservation of #4 and though a bit smaller it had every amenity that we needed. Elizabeth was a very accommodating and gracious host and if ever we are in Salem again; my wife and I will very gladly book here again. If you need something that is not visible like an ironing board for example; ask Elizabeth and she will make sure to make it available if she can. For being only a block from a busy street, the house and yard were very quiet due to the abundance of trees. We always had shade and the hot tub was very nice late in the evening. What a great stay! Thanks Elizabeth for all you did for us and made possible!"
15815105,292734223,2018-07-18,94094323,Kevin,What a charming home...So much nicer than the photos.  Elizabeth is the perfect host and makes me want to stay there longer...Down to earth and comfortable are the words I use to describe this host and her home. 
15815105,295062602,2018-07-22,33230749,Angela (Engayla),"This was the most awesome stay on airbnb I have ever experienced. Elizabeth is such a thoughtful, positive, kind, and generous host! Our stay by far exceeded our expectations! <br/>Thank you for truly providing a home away from home!<br/>We will be back for sure!"
15815105,295964741,2018-07-24,137408046,Anjanette,Vista Manor is a magical place. Elizabeth provides all of the extra touches. Any items you may have forgotten to pack are available. The bed was comfortable and waking up to the sunrise was magical. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance. If I ever need to stay in Salem again I will choose Vista Manor!
15815105,296380564,2018-07-25,109734669,Kristine,"What an AMAZING place!!! We have stayed at many Airbnb’s in our travels and this place was easily one of my FAVORITES! Sorry for the caps I just loved her place so much! So many thoughtful touches, gorgeous property, she was a wonderful host and stayed up when we arrived later than expected! She was a dream and we had the best stay and had such a hard time leaving! We will come back again to stay at Elizabeth’s place if we are ever in the area again! <br/><br/>5 out of 5 stars! If I could give more I would! :)"

15815105,299372192,2018-07-30,133144576,Christina,"Hostess thought of everything and was very helpful, lovely house and room :)"
15815105,299789454,2018-07-31,2515648,Joan,Large beautiful house in a quiet neighborhood. Couldn't ask for a nicer place!
15815105,300672067,2018-08-02,6368811,Betsy,"A place not to be missed if you're in Salem OR. It's beautiful, secluded, welcoming, and has both a pool (for the heat) and hot tub (for the cold). The house is gorgeous, with many spaces to relax and have space to yourself both indoors & out. Wonderful owner and host, Elizabeth. You couldn't ask for more! Enjoy!"
15815105,303559042,2018-08-07,31862841,Manya,"This was our first air bnb experience and I’m afraid Elizabeth has spoiled us! Her thoughtfulness and kindness has surpassed every expectation. The room was spotless, bed SO comfortable, and room filled with so many amenities! She is so considerate and has anticipated any neeed a travellor might have. Room is spacious, with table and chairs. Bathroom is large and filled with extra towels as well as more items a traveler might need. Her home is large, comfy and accessible. My favorite area is her beautiful yard with lush vegetation and comfy lounging chairs. She kept the jacuzzi hot for us and the pool clean with fresh towels. She keeps ducks and chickens and made us a fresh egg breakfast a few times. She also baked fresh muffins on occasion and provided daily water and fresh fruit. I wish I could give 10 stars! She truly is a super Hostess and a wonderful lady. "
15815105,306581215,2018-08-12,82195916,Jason,"Look no further for an amazing place to stay in Salem!!! The BEAT hospitality we'veexperienced, comfy bed, great space, and perfectlocation in Salem. Found a new home for when we come to visit. Oh... and the shower was to DIE for ;-)<br/>"
15815105,308113548,2018-08-15,121763162,Jorge,"Elizabeths places is a jewl! The place was one of the best 3 I ever stayed on Airbnb, and she was a great, thoughtful and helpful host. I wouldnt hesitate to recommend her or stay with her again.  Thank you Elizabeth!"
15815105,309801503,2018-08-18,71702702,Amzi,Elizabeth has A+++ communication and was very accommodating! Her place was wonderful with a great pool area. Thank you for helping make my trip easy and enjoyable.
15815105,312071440,2018-08-22,56634987,William,"Vista Manor is a wonderful airbnb: mansion sized on a couple of acres, beautifully landscaped with garden patio, a pool and hot tub, guest house, eclectic collection of vehicles, a beautiful Lacy Wyandotte chicken, ducks, a large and nicely marked Rex rabbit, a Siamese cat, a dog, huge rooms (ours had a fireplace, built-in desk and breakfast nook,) but what makes this property a standout is something intangible: a generosity of spirit. In the hall there are muffins and fruit, a dozen bottles of water, the top drawer of the cabinet held a large collection of toiletries, tissues, soaps and the basket in my bathroom held almost as many items including new tooth brushes, a family-sized toothpaste, floss, a sewing kit, eyeglass repair kit and on the shelf above the sink 2 sturdy water glasses. The bathroom also had a claw foot tub-shower with old-fashioned copper hardware! The windows have no motel/hotel curtains or drapes. To me, this suggests Elizabeth possesses a generosity of spirit and a trusting soul; qualities too often absent generally in our fast-paced and sometimes cynical society."
15815105,312582402,2018-08-23,95885947,Duy,"A true 5-star experience like you would find in an actual 5-star hotel.  Communication is detailed and host was easy to reach. She went a lot of extra miles to ensure I was able to find her place and that I am properly checked in. The welcome was very warm. <br/>The room is vastly spacious with an equally massive list of what she provides. I'm talking everything from snacks to microwave to sew kits. There is truly an impressive number of things Elizabeth provides you. <br/>In short, if you choose to book, you will get a room as big as a living room, hospitality as warm as home, and a list of ammenities that rivals a 5-star hotel. <br/>"
15815105,315427737,2018-08-28,120987280,Jenny,"Great suite with private bath, in room microwave, coffee maker, refrigerator and snacks. <br/><br/>Although I did not have time to enjoy the garden and pool it looked to be great place to relax"
15815105,315799959,2018-08-29,188371147,Angela,"Loved staying in this Airbnb!  Beautiful, comfortable, and easy to get in and out.  Lots of special details!!  Coffee, tea, fresh fruit, and homemade bread!!!  Loved it!!"
15815105,316689871,2018-08-31,188371147,Angela,We loved our stay!  We come to Salem about once a year and will definitely try to stay there again!

15815105,322668989,2018-09-13,13127414,Robbi,"Loved staying at Elizabeth's place.  She is incredibly friendly and hospitable. The room is clean and spacious with plenty of room for the 2 of us and our dog. Loved the homemade treats, fruit bowl, and assorted breakfast fare  as well as having the mini-fridge, microwave, and Keurig in the room.  We loved strolling around the huge property and the neighborhood. The location is very convenient to downtown."
15815105,325820252,2018-09-20,214025719,Tamme,"Elizabeth's was quiet, comfortable and close to everything.  The king size bed was like sleeping in butter."
15815105,326199071,2018-09-21,59378167,Paul,"My wife and I have stayed at five Airbnb's in the Salem area and Elizabeth's place is by far the best.  Beginning with the lovely home and Elizabeth's warm and fun personality, then continuing with the large guest room with a very comfortable and spacious bed plus a walk-in closet with a view and the private bath, as well as the homemade pumpkin bread and nice extras (fresh fruit, snack bars, oatmeal, popcorn, etc.  The entire experience was wonderful.  And for smokers (I enjoy a nice cigar each evening), Elizabeth graciously allowed me use of the patio and garden area for this pleasure.  The cats were an added bonus, as well as the very calm golden retriever, Chloe.  We highly recommend this extra-special place for visitors to Salem!"
15815105,328602302,2018-09-26,152244303,Cherel,Always a great stay - our base for being with the grandkids - Elizabeth makes it so easy with her thoughtful touches.
15815105,328970579,2018-09-27,33458462,Carolyn,I always love coming back to Elizabeth’s.  Staying in the lovely room with the king bed is a real treat – there’s almost room to hold a dance inside and the bathroom is large enough for four people to be getting ready at the same time!  Pumpkin bread in the morning and I feel well taken care of!
15815105,334339032,2018-10-08,191561579,Sam,"Wonderful place to stay. Beautiful home with clean room and bathroom. Elizabeth is very helpful if you have questions. All the extras (muffins, bottled water, etc) were nice extras. Would definitely stay again."
15815105,334655137,2018-10-09,33458462,Carolyn,"Elizabeth's home is lovely, with very comfortable beds that invite you to linger, drinking the excellent coffee, eating the wonderful homemade pumpkin bread, much longer than the day's agenda really allows!  She is a wonderful hostess, checking in about timing, special needs--I am always happy to stay with Elizabeth."
15815105,334956927,2018-10-10,219734194,Stephanie,Wonderful stay- with great breakfast and super comfy bed!
15815105,340099407,2018-10-22,18835826,Annette,"Elizabeth's place was the first time I stayed inside an AirBnB residence, so I wasn't sure what to expect as far as privacy, etc.  Her place went beyond my expectations- it was an absolutely lovely and comfortable space, and she provided every amenity you could possibly need and more.  Everything from location, communication, parking, access to restaurants and shopping was top notch.  I hope to stay here again when I am in the area again."
15815105,342485855,2018-10-28,40104763,Ann,Elizabeth’s Place home away for home for us. Our daughters go to college in Salem so we book Elizabeth’s Place whenever it is available. The bed is so comfortable that I had the hardest time getting out of it to leave today!!
15815105,344485640,2018-11-03,47989343,Caroline,"Great house, very nicely and cohesively decorated as well as preserved. Great room! It was a large room with plenty of space for our things and was an incredibly comfy long bed! <br/>Quiet neighborhood, and great communication from host. <br/>Would stay again!"
15815105,345252593,2018-11-04,3402469,Wylie,"We just stayed for a night and wished it were longer. The house is charming and spacious. Elizabeth is a thoughtful, gracious host."
15815105,345686722,2018-11-05,25239571,Carol Joy,Elizabeth's place was great!  The room was beautiful and spacious and quiet.  The banana walnut bread was lovely in the morning and Elizabeth was so warm and nice to connect with.  We had a great stay. I highly recommend her beautiful home.
15815105,346749158,2018-11-09,224848339,Michael,"Elizabeth was awesome!! So kind, provided a lovely, comfortable, perfectly appointed space, along with superlative communication... and she even threw my laundry in the dryer for me too! :-)"
15815105,347774142,2018-11-11,134433252,Catherine,Elizabeth’s place is a lovely home that was conveniently located!

15815105,352084927,2018-11-24,140256962,Charity,"This place is lovely, clean, and relatively spacious. It has an extremely comfortable bed with multiple pillows. The windows are nice, the bathtub is great, and the tea/coffee and breakfast options are good and convenient. Also, Elizabeth is quite pleasant and helpful and the various animals that can be sighted sometimes are cute :) Especially the huge gray and white bunny :)"
15815105,358256694,2018-12-13,31287476,Susan,"Elizabeth's home is the nicest place we have ever stayed in all our travels.  The home is very large and beautifully decorated. The bedroom we stayed in was spacious with a sitting area in front of the fireplace, beautiful woodwork and windows with a view out to the grounds.  (The property used to be a nursery, so there are many species of trees and plants in the landscape.)   The bed was so comfortable that we checked out what kind of mattress so we could get one for our home.  The large private bathroom had a claw-foot tub and shower, and there is a huge walk-in closet. There were fresh baked muffins and fruit every day.  Our host was just the right blend of professional and friendly.  We felt right at home from the beginning. There were so many special touches throughout our stay.  I will be staying there from now on when we visit Salem!"
15815105,362152529,2018-12-25,62833184,Sharon,We stayed in a comfortable suite with a very comfortable king bed. There were many thoughtful extras such as bottled water and homemade bread.
15815105,408227404,2019-02-03,232616732,Michelle,"I stayed here for several weeks when I first moved to Salem and it was a nice welcome to the area. Elizabeth is a great host who goes out of her way to make sure that guests are comfortable and have everything they might need on hand. Rooms for this Airbnb are in a beautiful old house located within walking distance to several restaurants and a grocery store. The room was very clean and was stocked with plenty of towels, as well as pretty much every amenity you may have forgotten or would need. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet, so sleeping peacefully was no problem. Because my stay was in the winter, I could not really enjoy the back garden, but it seemed like it would be a great place to lounge around and relax in when it was not so cold and rainy."
15815105,410844462,2019-02-10,3963056,Don,"If you are needing a beautiful and comfortable place to relax, this is it!  We stayed in the upstairs suite for 2 nights as we attended a professional conference in Dallas, OR, 20 min away.  Suite included large bathroom with claw foot bath and shower. The king bed was sooooooo comfortable.  2 armchairs, a small table and chairs, dresser, desk, fireplace, and large walk in closet.  There was fresh fruit, baked goods daily, yogurt, oatmeal,  teas and coffee available for a quick breakfast.  Wine downstairs.  And a very nice hot tub that was wonderful at night.  Beautiful grounds.  Surrounded by trees.  Walkable to restaurants.  Outstanding hospitality and care given by Elizabeth.  Would highly recommend.  P.S.  There is a smaller queen size bedroom with a private bath on the same floor, also available on her site.  FYI: You must be able to climb a flight of stairs."
15815105,411535747,2019-02-12,15090402,Gwen,Beautiful room with everything anyone could possibly need!
15815105,425729596,2019-03-18,138796271,Jeannette,"Fabulous home, hospitality, and service! We look forward to our next trip just to stay here! Elizabeth is amazing and very thoughtful!"
15815105,426322079,2019-03-20,248847949,Elizabeth,"Elizabeth is a phenomenal host, and the room was amazing! From a coffee maker, to a robe for the hot tub, to a sewing kit, no detail or potential need was overlooked. The location is great--groceries, restaurants, and cafes are all in walking distance. The property is gorgeous, and the outside kitties were very sweet and friendly. She was able to accommodate a later check-in for me, which I really appreciated."
15815105,428328937,2019-03-24,127183864,Jessica,"This home is beautiful! It is placed just off the beaten path where the traffic is quite but you are still just minutes from all the action. The roundabout drive way made parking simple and could easily accommodate a truck and trailer. Elizabeth graciously greeted us apon our arrival. The keypad entry was a great addition especially because I may have forgotten  my keys in the room once. Inside the house is very clean and well decorated. There is lots of space for guests to sit and enjoy the space. There is even an office on the first floor for you late night workers who wish to not disturb your partner. We stayed in the master bedroom which is just up the staircase. The stairs are wide making baggage hauling easy. As you reach the top of the  stairs there is a table filled with fruit and fresh baked goods around the clock. My Six Year Old Son definitely had more than his share and I may have as well. The master room is just to the right and it is huge! It has a dead bolt so you can secure your room. As you walk in you have your own fully stocked kitchenette, two chair seating by the fireplace which can be used. Loved that. A super soft king size bed, large tv and a table and chairs placed by two gorgeous window over looking the back yard. The bathroom like the rest of the room was well lit and very clean. Elizabeth really went the extra mile to try and provide everything you may have forgot in your travel. But for me the best part was the closet it was huge and my son was so excited about it that he made it his room complete with a mattress covered cot provided by the host. Over all we were very comfortable here so much so that my son tried refusing to leave. Elizabeth was an amazing host and has successfully in my option created a great BnB. Thank you for opening your home for us to enjoy. We will be back!"
15815105,429045018,2019-03-26,986656,Jackie,The room at Elizabeth’s house was delightful! We had everything we needed along with many thoughtful touches including homemade banana bread. The room overlooked the garden and had a view of the city lights. The bed was very comfortable. The room itself was large and roomy. We could also have made a fire in the fireplace if we wished. Elizabeth was easy to communicate with and was also very helpful. You’ll love staying at her place in Salem!

15815105,461036559,2019-05-30,62065,Janet,"This beautiful Tudor home is an oasis right next to city amenities.  There are plenty of restaurants nearby and a really nice grocery. The interior of the home has many original fixtures and the decor is fancilly tasteful, without being at all pretentious. Very comfortable!<br/>The kingsize bed was like sleeping on a giant cloud. And I took a couple of nice long baths in the clawfoot tub. This room was my kind of lodgings. <br/>Elizabeth the host is so friendly and great to talk with. And her menagerie of cute critters were fun to watch and hang out with. (Look for a very handsome rabbit!)<br/>When I find myself in Salem again, I do hope their might be a vacancy at this lovely estate. Fingers crossed!"
15815105,463179370,2019-06-02,59477049,Gregory,Both my wife and I enjoyed a very pleasant and relaxing stay at Elizabeth's home. Even though you are in the city of Salem you almost  feel like you are out in the country! We were quite surprised and happy to find that our roomy second floor bedroom & bath had many amenities and personal touches that we didn't expect! We found Elizabeth's hospitality to be  exquisitely delightful! (:

The bed was comfy, amenities are amazing, and you'll get to understand what is so special about claw foot tubs!  <br/>We are hosts ourselves who strive for perfection for guests.  Elizabeth is just as amazing as her room!    Her place would rival 5 star hotels.  Look no further and book this amazing Air Bnb!"
15815105,473472788,2019-06-21,88556308,Susan,Beautiful classic home with lovey gardens and very Elizabeth was a great host and our room was spectacular.

LOVED IT!!
15815105,475129940,2019-06-23,173598285,Kim,Our visit went beyond our expectations and needs. The room was splendid and very comfortable with many unexpected touches. We will try and stay with Elizabeth again if we are back in Salem.
15815105,476663641,2019-06-26,185540004,John,"Above and beyond in a wonderful upstairs, king bed room with tons of space and storage.  A clubfoot tub to relax in or shower in luxury.  Extras galore, Keurig coffee pot with coffee pods, tea pods, tea bags, bathroom amenities are abundant in case you forgot anything.  Elizabeth is available and helpful.  Wonderful stay."
15815105,477165215,2019-06-27,1131636,Jeanne,"If you're ever in Salem stay at Vista Manor. You won't be disappointed. Elizabeth is an exceptional host and her home is absolutely beautiful. If we're ever in the area again, we'll definitely stay there..."
15815105,477747394,2019-06-28,122764052,Anne Marie,A slice of heaven in a secret hamlet in south Salem!
15815105,481407773,2019-07-04,40062431,Kiersten,"Elizabeth is an amazing hostess and we never even got to meet in person; she routinely checked to make sure we did not need anything and the room offered all the travel amenities one could possibly need. The bed was amazing and the room charming. We could not recommend this airb&b more!! If we ever come back to Salem, we will check Elizabeth's lodging first."
15815105,483649690,2019-07-07,3013004,Jakey,"Great, spacious room with good light and a dreamy claw foot tub. Elizabeth is a friendly and warm host who has a marvelous property that was perfect for my needs. 10/10 would stay here again!"
15815105,484874458,2019-07-09,81339673,Gabriela,Super nice and convenient place to stay. It was quiet and calm and clean the self check in isn’t exactly self check in. She’ll meet with you first and give you a tour and then from there on out it’s as you please which is nice and convenient. Overall great stay.
15815105,485350886,2019-07-10,203040883,Tee,Elizabeth is a super host! She made sure we are comfortable during our stay!
15815105,487103699,2019-07-13,103250586,Shelley,"Such a lovely place so close to lots to do in Salem area. We chose Elizabeth's establishment based on the photos or her historic home and what amenities she offered. The photos and description did not disappoint!<br/>A lovely tudor style home built in the 1920's on over an acre of  well landscaped  grounds. The interior is tastefully decorated: we chose the king suite and it was spacious, airy with all of the toiletries you would need or want in the ensuite bath with a gorgeous claw foot tub! In addition there was a beautiful wood burning fireplace in the bedroom.<br/>Elizabeth had fresh flowers on the breakfast table waiting for us when we arrived. We even had a small kitchenette stocked with fresh muffins, fruit, cereal and yogurt. In addition, there was a keurig maker with assorted coffee and teas with cream and sugar.<br/>China and silverware along with wine glasses and corkscrew were also provided.<br/>She does have pets on premise to which I was a little nervous about as I am allergic. Not to worry! She keeps a spotless home and doesn't allow her furry kids in the guest rooms.<br/>I didn't sneeze once!<br/>She was delightful to chat and message with. I had questions about proximity to Waterfront Park where we were attending a concert to which she replied quickly with directions and also suggested a few tasty dinner and breakfast restaurants to enjoy during our stay. <br/>I forgot to mention she also has an inground pool and hot tub that we just didn't have time to enjoy, next time we will stay longer!<br/>Elizabeth was a gracious host with a lovely home. It is very reasonably priced for such a wonderful place with so much to offer."
15815105,488274368,2019-07-14,270873134,Marilyn,"Easy location to find, close to restaurants and gas stations (but you don't feel like you're in a city!). Very lovely location."
15815105,489935185,2019-07-17,189822787,Tara,"Vista Manor is amazing. Elizabeth is so sweet. The room is amazing. This is my second time staying here and we were in the blue room with the king bed and claw bathtub. There were blueberry muffins handmade by Elizabeth! The amenities are amazing and far above and beyond any hotel. The puppy I got to pet was so sweet! The backyard is beautiful. Honestly, the house is so beautiful that my husband and I enjoyed an evening in just hanging out in our room and relaxing. I will attempt to book one of her rooms each time I stay in Salem."
15815105,492908613,2019-07-21,33230749,Angela (Engayla),"This is a gem airbnb! A beautiful old Manor that one would not expect behind beautiful trees and gardens not visible from the street. Elizabeth treats her guests like family members. The rooms are very clean, there are fresh flowers in the room, she offers a welcome beverage and coffee, tea, fruit and fresh baked muffins in the morning. The Manor is also the home of dogs, cats, rabbits, and chickens in the beautiful backyard. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
15815105,494110003,2019-07-23,17635156,Ann,"A spotlessly clean and beautifully (period appropriate) decorated experience in the Tutor house where you can read all about the history  on the wall in the hallway (nicely researched!). <br/>We arrived about ~ 1 hr later than expected, but she had fresh blueberry muffins, fresh fruit, and cold water there waiting for us. The king sized bed room was very spacious with a fireplace, fresh flowers on both the work desk area as well as the dining table across the room, and helpful pamphlets of attractions in the area. The space in the room was easily double the size I was expecting with a fireplace and huge walking area as well as a large bathroom and area when you first walk in  (where you find the fridge and tea/coffee and cereals). Downstairs was a gorgeous living and dining area and library/study that overlooked the backyard garden where little tables to sit out and chat were placed. My only regret is not getting there in time to check out the pool or hot tub!  I think this is the best B&B I've stayed in so far (and I've used B&B in Alaska, Scotland, USA, Australia, and Canada over the years, so quite a few places). Guaranteed if you stay here you will not regret your stay!"
15815105,495917832,2019-07-26,39088343,Aphrodite,"Elizabeth’s house is beautifully appointed and very clean. She is l wonderful host. I loved the grounds that had lovely flowers, baby ducks and chickens! The handpicked fresh  flowers that were placed our big beautiful room was a thoughtful gesture. I would stay with her again in a heartbeat."
15815105,496671584,2019-07-27,275631861,Dillon,"The room was reasonably priced, comfortable, and in a great location. Also loved the hot tub and pool."
15815105,497792728,2019-07-28,268244773,Melanie,Great place to stay and a great host to work with.
15815105,498380477,2019-07-29,73077758,Alicia,"Great room, wonderful host - perfect for what we were looking for. Thanks so much!"
15815105,505086986,2019-08-08,37839589,Renee,"Lovely home, the suite was perfect for the 2 of us and very convenient.  The hostess made us feel right at home.  We loved the landscaping & Vista views.  Absolutely would stay here again!"
15815105,507707047,2019-08-11,270271220,Robert,This was my introduction to Airbnb and thanks to Elizabeth and the great accomodations at Vista Manor I'm hooked. Very clean and great amenities.
15815105,508328937,2019-08-12,32787097,Landon,"Loved Elizabeth’s place! A character estate with characters (ie: chickens, ducks, dogs and cats - of course not in the Airbnb areas). Suite was very large and comfy.  Elizabeth probably provided as many extra things should you need them (ie: toothpaste, bandaids, sewing kit, etc) as any place we have been.  So thoughtful.  Bed was great and the little mini fridge, microwave and Keurig was great.  Would stay again."
15815105,508965166,2019-08-13,44266693,Ben,"Great communication, very comfortable, and lots of little perks.  Felt like home.  I wish I could’ve stayed longer!"
15815105,512958739,2019-08-18,4637247,Brittany,"My husband and I stayed here for a few days for an anniversary get away.  Elizabeth's home was easy to find and located near several restaurants and stores. Her home was clean and comfortable and we had all the amenities we needed. There was water and breakfast snacks available, including fresh blueberry muffins. We utilized the back patio as well to get outside and enjoythe fresh air. Elizabeth has several friendly cats and dogs that allowed us to pet them -- as an animal lover this was a definite plus for me!  We would certainly stay here again."
15815105,514152428,2019-08-20,38802402,Lily,"Wonderful stay! Big comfortable room and quite night. Delicious breakfast. Easy access to anywhere, good location. Definitely will come back. Thank you Elizabeth!"
15815105,517678075,2019-08-25,136636199,Lisa,Great hospitality in a quaint house. Relaxing.
15815105,521292079,2019-08-31,40104763,Ann,We have stayed at Elizabeth’s many times as both of our daughters at here for college. It feels like coming home every time we stay. She has always welcome us and our dogs. The beds are all super cozy. Can’t wait to be back in two weeks.
15815105,522210074,2019-09-01,136636199,Lisa,Elizabeth is a great host. Accommodations were perfect for us. Just a short walk from local restaurants and Starbucks! When in Salem again we plan to stay here again!
15815105,522968836,2019-09-02,109250084,Brittaney,A beautiful home in a lovely area with a very accommodating and friendly host. 11/10
15815105,527776091,2019-09-11,138823690,Dan & Terry,A perfect location for us when coming in to town for a show at the amazing Elsinore theater. What a neat property! Very nice and stylish decor. Thoughtful amenities. Great value for a one night stay.
15815105,530429440,2019-09-15,171187567,Libby,"Beautiful home, inviting room, every amenity one could want, and a warm and thoughtful host. Definitely recommend this place and will be going back myself. Thanks, Elizabeth."
15815105,531970176,2019-09-18,4123381,Linda,"This was a lovely room with lots of space.   The bathroom was large with plenty of towels.  Coffee, tea and snacks provided.  A very comfortable place to spend a night!"
15815105,534594838,2019-09-22,60664301,Kandi,"Love the home and in a nice neighborhood. Lots of places to lounge and relax. Beautiful antique decor for all to enjoy, very clean. Elizabeth was there to talk to and show me around, very nice lady and helpful. The bed and pillows, very comfortable. She didn't serve breakfast, but she had bread loafs and fruit in the hall and everything in your room you could want. There was a small frig with yogurt and water. She had oatmeal packs and snacks in a basket. Very nice and I plan to come back!"
15815105,541105125,2019-10-04,16753812,Peter,"Elizabeth`s place ands Elizabeth herself is the reason why I travel with AirBnB. Her 100 year old mansion is superbly maintained, modernized and all clean. I can hardly imagine staying in a nicer place in Salem at all. The room is cosy with a great large bed and a nice view to trees and garden from the bed when you weak up. The living room you are welcomed to use is amazing and huge with plenty of history in. If you ask Elizabeth she is willing to tell you the story of that house and about Mexico and Salem as well. She is a nice and intelligent person with a great sense of humor and it is nice talking to her. The tips where to go out for a little dinner fitted perfectly. All in walkable distance. If you're looking for a romantic place to feel home you all right in Elizabeth`s place. She sure is a super host!"
15815105,543898152,2019-10-08,183314653,Patrick,"Charming/Affordable and in a great location.  Elizabeth is a great host, I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in Salem area!"
15815105,545126590,2019-10-11,46787863,Rebecca,"Beautiful historic home, wonderfully appointed. Very comfortable room and bed.   Elizabeth makes sure you have what you need; she is a wonderful host.  I wish I could have had more time to visit with her."
15815105,546649888,2019-10-13,678491,Lisa,This is a great place. I loved staying there and really appreciated all the little touches. I really enjoyed Elizabeth's home.
15815105,553290640,2019-10-23,2143228,Cynthia,"This is a wonderful place to stay.  There are so many thoughtful touches.  I was amazed I could bring my well-behaved pooch and there wasn't an extra charge.  The room was clean, and well appointed.  It was awesome there was fresh fruit, snacks, and bottled water available.  Elizabeth is so responsive.  And it was great - I forgot my phone charger and she had one for me to borrow.  Will stay again!"
15815105,560425884,2019-11-06,296794161,Kimberly,"I have stayed in all three rooms. Each is cozy and comfortable. I stay at Vista Manor about twice per week for work. I look forward to coming here after a hard day of work. Second to my home. Thanks, Elizabeth!"
15815105,561102530,2019-11-08,2143228,Cynthia,"This is the place to go!  As a traveling professional, I work long hours.   I arrived tired and cranky.  I saw that there were thoughtful snacks laid out, and I helped myself to some popcorn, and chocolate cookies.  Watching a movie and relaxing in the most comfortable bed was great!  Waking up and having a hot shower with all the shampoo and everything I could need was so nice.  I do feel pampered.  I love how there is also always home made treats.  Although I didn't try them this time, I look forward to next time!  This place is great."
15815105,563991498,2019-11-14,2143228,Cynthia,"This place continues to be my home away from home.  Also feel so special when Elizabeth comes and says hello when we arrive.  She has the little touches of snacks, home-baked goods - bottled water, and oh-so-comfortable beds.   I like this place so much that my co-workers and employees are staying here when they come into Salem.    Love it here."
15815105,566279200,2019-11-18,2143228,Cynthia,Wonderful place to stay!
15815105,572445646,2019-12-02,5230863,Mary,"Wow. Elizabeth knows hospitality and great Airbnb service. The amenities are amazing. Fresh baked goodies, snacks, fresh fruit, bottled water, coffee, tea, bathroom amenities of every sort including aspirin. She offers wine in the main parlor. Very nice and friendly host in a wonderful estate. Hot tub (all season) and swimming pool with comfy bathrobes supplied. My room had a working fireplace. Special place!"
15815105,572999677,2019-12-04,2143228,Cynthia,"Elizabeth is always so warm and friendly.  She brought an extra comforter since the weather was cold.  Everything is decorated so nice and wintery!   I liked the cranberry bread she baked this time, and a little chocolate left in my room.    This place is a great place to stay."
15815105,573615750,2019-12-06,40532240,Jerry,Elizabeth's home was beautiful.  She was an excellent host.   She made me feel very welcomed and provided many unexpected extras that made my visit all the more better.  I recommend her without hesitation.

15815105,575605430,2019-12-10,2143228,Cynthia,The bed is so comfortable.   Everything is decorated so nice for the holidays.  It was quiet and warm.
15815105,575910207,2019-12-11,2143228,Cynthia,Always amazing and wonderful here!
15815105,576543045,2019-12-13,2143228,Cynthia,Appreciate the comfortable bed!   It's so nice a quiet.  Great place to get a good night's sleep.
15815105,577660319,2019-12-15,17961899,Dan,I was almost tempted to write a bad review so no one else discovers this gem.  It was everything and more that have come to expect from AirBnB.  Elizabeth's home is hands down the best we have stayed at and we have stayed at many both in this country and in Europe.
15815105,578730581,2019-12-18,296794161,Kimberly,Excellent place to stay in Salem. Privacy and quiet abound

15815105,581342577,2019-12-24,2143228,Cynthia,"I enjoy staying here.    Elizabeth makes sure everyone feels welcome.  Also even though I’m a frequent guest, there are different treats and different colored bedspreads so it’s a touch of familiar and new at the same time."
15815105,583525562,2019-12-28,60102748,Catherine,We had a great stay here! Elizabeth was a very welcoming host and provided a charming place for us to stay.
15815105,587933949,2020-01-03,274543681,Evangelist,"If you want to stay where you feel most comfortable upon check in and meeting your Host, then this is the place. She hasn't thought about everything a traveler would need when away from home. I mean everything-- it is obvious she is well traveled and you can feel this immediately upon check in. I will always check her availability when staying in Salem --  an amazing Host"
15815105,590484462,2020-01-08,274543681,Evangelist,Home is a perfect place away from HOME.

15815105,591199627,2020-01-10,309574326,Karen,"Elizabeth cares about each of her guests and personally  greeted me soon after my arrival. She thought of everything  someone might need. The offering of snacks, baked goods, fruit and coffee was fabulous. The most was very comfortable. Elizabeth provided a space heater which made the room cozy as the space was a little chilly. Very in tune with her guests! Would definitely stay again."
15815105,592295438,2020-01-12,60664301,Kandi,We both loved our stay and the room we had. The bed was soft and comfortable. The house is beautiful and clean and old at the same time. Elizabeth does a great job to make sure you have everything you could want and need. She has snacks in the room and muffins and fruit in the hall. This is the second time staying here and we will be back.
15815105,593755887,2020-01-16,101740,Pam,"Such a lovely home.  I enjoyed my stay tremendously, and am already planning to return."
15815105,594059795,2020-01-17,219983607,Rebecca,We had a lovely stay. Elizabeth's place is truly top notch.
15815105,595212390,2020-01-19,286333900,Laurie,The Manor is a must experience when in Salem. The house is amazing and so is Elizabeth.
15815105,596760813,2020-01-23,274543681,Evangelist,I am working in Salem for the next 6 months and this is the only place I want to stay.

15815105,597471413,2020-01-25,40104763,Ann,Another wonderful stay at Elizabeth’s! The only problem is the bed is too comfortable and I never want to get up. We stay here every time we come to see our daughters at college in Salem. It’s our home away from home.
15815105,598264340,2020-01-26,37005740,Kyle,"House filled with character and charm, in a tranquil setting. Great find."

15815105,614577252,2020-03-05,274543681,Evangelist,The details is in the home and HOST. Lovely touches
15815105,614962686,2020-03-06,274543681,Evangelist,The details is in the home and HOST. Lovely touches
15815105,617716353,2020-03-13,274543681,Evangelist,"Elizabeth has been an exceptional Host, especially during this time. She has taken additional measures to make sure her guest are safe and protected in her home. I appreciate her and the measures she is taking to makes sure me and my family are healthy."
15815105,618728650,2020-03-15,274543681,Evangelist,Elizabeth showed care for me and my family during our final week at her home. Her home was a home away from home and I would recommend her place for anyone who is looking to stay in Salem
15815105,620123414,2020-03-20,274543681,Evangelist,Elizabeth has made my time.away from home feel like I have found a new home... She is considerate and aware of what a customer will need. I will miss my home.away from home
15815105,621160598,2020-03-28,23676633,Em,"Very kind, responsive hostess. A lovely home, with relaxing grounds. We were on the road from Ohio when Oregon instituted the 'stay at home' protocol for the coronavirus outbreak. Elizabeth provided a very supportive information, and a warm welcome, while putting the social distancing actions into practice. We are very pleased to have stayed with Elizabeth for our first few days moving back to Oregon."
15815105,625776312,2020-05-23,333023930,Lucinda,The place was amazing and so was the hospitality. Elizabeth really went above and beyond all expectations.
15815105,626457043,2020-05-27,164378958,Natalia,"Beautiful home, beautiful room. <br/>Huge rabbit in the background! Very comfortable king bed, seriously comfortable. The room was clean and well-decorated, BnB-feel which was great for relaxing. Guests were asked in binder found in room to go through the dining room to get to outdoor hot tub. However, door leading to dining room was locked.<br/>Suggestions: Willamette Valley Vineyards is amazing. Also, beautiful parks, more touristy Riverfront Park or likes hikes and more secluded beautiful scenery then definitely Minto-Brown Island park."
15815105,627114964,2020-05-31,76801790,Katrina,"Wonderful Place! Great value for such a spectacular, warm and quiet setting!"

We will definitely stay here again, we almost add the second night but our itinerary in Oregon is so busy that we couldn’t. We really enjoyed our stay here."
15815105,631301167,2020-06-21,69697471,Melanie,"Elizabeth's Tudor is a wonderful place to stay in Salem. The home, grounds, and friendly felines are both as comfortable as home, yet with a feeling of being in a special place. We thoroughly enjoyed the spacious en suite, the comfortable living room, and the delightful hot tub. It was nice to soak after hiking at Silver Falls State Park. Having some school work to finish up on-line, I even spent time in the windowed office area. Elizabeth was easy to communicate with and left us a personalized anniversary gift along with fresh flowers. We had delicious meals from Straight From New York pizza and Ritters, per her suggestions. I definitely recommend and will visit again."
15815105,632307895,2020-06-26,101740,Pam,"Elizabeth has an extremely comfortable home, with lots of privacy and a thousand thoughtful touches."

15815105,633148898,2020-06-28,105586495,Crystal,"Elizabeth’s home is the most detailed, thought out, cleanest place you’ll ever stay at! My room was more than anything I ever imagined- not only was it super clean before we entered her home she had masks and hand sanitizer prepared! Everything is surrounded in green nature, she even has a few cats and a bunny (they’re so sweet) Wish I can rate a trillion stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ if you’re looking for a place with maximum comfort/privacy/ restaurants all around you ...stay at this home! You won’t regret it : ) the sweet bread she leaves out for you in the morning goes so well with the coffee she also provides! A true angel"
15815105,634370949,2020-07-03,7447116,Carmel,"The property is lovely, Elizabeth has thought of everything, and it is a totally stress-free experience staying at Vista Manor."
15815105,634604062,2020-07-04,162019974,Leila,"Elizabeth’s place is elegant and beautiful. The house is a 1924 Tudor style house. We were greeted at the front door by Elizabeth, the front entrance had pretty flowers, and Chloe the pretty and sweet dog. We were led upstairs on a lovey old finished staircase, to our room which was a suite. We had access to lovely baked goods and fruit, coffee, tea, and other snacks. The bedroom was large with a king sized bed, the mattress was soft, we had a very comfy sleep. Adjoining the room was a large bathroom and also a  very large sitting room/closet with an extra bed. The floors were finished hardwood, the bathroom had an old leaded glass window that swung open with what looked to be original hardware. Everything was charming. The room had an air conditioning unit which we didn’t need to use. The hot tub and pool were invigorating. We had let Elizabeth know that this was an anniversary road trip and she left a thoughtful card and wine for us. We definitely want to stay here again!"
15815105,637547875,2020-07-12,352380915,John,"Stay here, it is perfect."
15815105,637911881,2020-07-13,272145842,Irene,This is a charming home and a wonderful host. We will definitely come back again.
15815105,638487712,2020-07-15,23584033,Dan,"Cool historic house, comfortable accommodations, great host, has everything for an amazing stay in Salem!"
15815105,638795071,2020-07-16,311206552,Mireille,"If you want fabulous service in a beautiful setting but don’t know where to go, this house in Salem is THE place to go. First, the house is gorgeous and well renovated. The pool is clean and perfect for children and grown-ups alike. The backyard and the back patio Offer beauty and peace. And Elizabeth is setting the bar very high when it comes to hosting. Freshly home baked deliciousness of many kinds, fruits galore, various snacks and more water and hot beverages you can drink. The master room is a dream, with everything in it, down to details such as first aid and sewing kits. If you forgot something, Elizabeth will most likely have it for you. And the bed is soooo comfy, you will sleep like a baby. And I even got to make an omelette with the fresh eggs from the hens on property. Elizabeth is such a gracious, mindful and caring host. My best overall experience with Airbnb for sure!"
15815105,640200301,2020-07-19,13457660,Joshua,"My wife and daughter and I had a very restful stay at Elizabeth's place. We were on a road trip, and so the king sized bed was clutch, and very comfy. The master bedroom had a small bedroom attached that was perfect for our two year olds pack and play, so the adults could have a separate room with privacy after she went to bed. The pool and jacuzzi were clean, and very cool and hot, respectively. We enjoyed walking in the backyard, searching for kitties, bunnies and chickens. It was a perfect spot for two nights for the three of us."
15815105,641197375,2020-07-22,181863270,Emily,Such a beautiful house and the outside is just as amazing as the inside! Would recommend to anyone I know! Fast responses to messages and any amenities you could think of!
15815105,646765709,2020-08-04,82195916,Jason,"Will not stay anywhere else in Salem! Elizabeth is the BEST and we just love staying at her place. Treats in every room, homemade pastries in the morning and AC in the room ;-) As long as she is a host, we will stay in one of her rooms!"
15815105,648374102,2020-08-08,6795482,Kate,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Vista Manor. For comfort and kindness, it would be hard to beat. We are in our 70s and transitioning from a house just sold to the new house, which isn’t ready. We and our sweet old dog would have stayed another couple of days at Vista Manor but, in spite of the innkeeper spending literally hours on the phone with Airbnb personnel, the corporate people refused to remove a block on an empty room. We were thus denied the use of the room, and we were forced to move on, with great difficulty, before it was convenient. A great deal of stress and anguish resulted from Airbnb’s seeming lack of consideration and total disregard for the comfort and wellbeing of the customers, us, in fact. It was enough to turn us off Airbnb for good. Frustrating and in the end harmful to our family."
15815105,652351410,2020-08-16,171724097,Haley,"Elizabeth was the best, amazing stay with very thoughtful touches. Can’t wait to return in the future."
15815105,656434662,2020-08-25,188371147,Angela,"This was our third stay at Elizabeth's place.  Always comfortable, and delightful!  Very clean and easy to come and go.  You won't be disappointed!"
15815105,660330962,2020-09-04,154598224,Tina,Great place to stay. The owner is amazing!
15815105,660639675,2020-09-05,42872079,Jake,This was probably the most well thought out place I've stayed at. Elizabeth thought of everything you could possibly need and has it readily available. The room was perfect and the entire home was beautiful. Was nice to walk around the back yard and watch the chickens and rabbit.
15815105,661322781,2020-09-06,111990320,Amanda,"Elizabeth goes above and beyond to make her guests feel special! She had everything you can think of—snacks, water, coffee & breakfast! Very thoughtful and sweet lady. Her place was very spacious, unique and comfortable! Highly recommend."
15815105,662421998,2020-09-09,183314653,Patrick,"Great host, very quick to respond to questions.  This was our second time staying and we can't wait to plan our next trip here!"
15815105,664070745,2020-09-13,349416600,Mike,"Clean room, responsive service in a unique setting."
15815105,664692537,2020-09-15,199324451,Randa,"If you are traveling to Salem, OR, this is where you want to stay! Elizabeth is a gracious hostess; and her home and the grounds are clean, comfortable and beautiful. Quiet and serene - a place to relax."
15815105,666909008,2020-09-21,176038296,Gage,Place was fantastic.  I will definitely be looking to stay again when I come back to Salem
15815105,668828316,2020-09-27,211742989,Jerick,Very beautiful home where the hosts make you feel so important. The location is in a perfect spot!
15815105,670557672,2020-10-03,367363341,Lori,Incredible experience all around. Beautiful home and grounds. Elizabeth is so friendly and helpful.
15815105,673012604,2020-10-10,262288431,Alexa,"This place is beautiful and quaint with so much fun character! The room was spacious and the hosts were very inviting—literally the only thing that wasn’t top notch was the shower experience. The shower curtain is inside of a claw footed tub, so it is very small and the shower curtain closes in around your body."
15815105,700272294,2020-10-13,371048741,Joshua,Elizabeth is really though and added touches to the stay that we didn’t even think of but we really appreciated. She made me and my wife feel so loved and so welcomed. Very clean and taken care of place.
15815105,701246285,2020-10-17,185540004,John,Excellent airbnb.  Well done.
15815105,701893234,2020-10-18,101763263,Lori,"This is a lovely, quaint older home with great character and charm.  Many special touches. Close to vineyards and many restaurants. Awesome decorations for  Halloween on the property.  We didn't utilize the pool/hot tub (out of season) but looks like it would be so nice!  This place being old has the creaks and noises of older homes, that is to be expected, but not a deterrent for us. Very comfortable king bed, nice hot shower, yummy apple cookies!"
15815105,703977702,2020-10-25,372592504,Orlie,This home is just beautiful and filled with amenities! A quiet neighborhood yet close to shops and downtown. Just perfect while visiting my daughter at Willamette.
15815105,706450506,2020-11-03,366286187,Alexander,"Stayed the night in the master suite.  It was absolutely fantastic.  Very cool and large room, beautiful garden, and orchids all throughout the common area.  Located in a really nice spot of Salem.  Uber had trouble finding it because you can't see the house from the road.  It's covered up by the greenery.<br/>It was absolutely perfect.  Would highly recommend."
15815105,706773381,2020-11-05,31620856,Chip,"Elizabeth’s place makes you feel like a welcomed guest. She has thought of everything you might need. The space is beautiful, quiet and charming. The location is perfect."

15815105,711150189,2020-11-24,374219209,Jennifer,"Super host is an understatement when it comes to Elizabeth. While here for an extended stay, I have wanted for nothing. She has anticipated everything one could need, from toiletries to snacks to wine keys, all in a welcoming and peaceful environment. Super convenient to grocery store and food venues while tucked away with a beautiful garden. Won’t stay anywhere else now when visiting!"
15815105,712030076,2020-11-28,374121773,Kyle,"Wonderful place to stay with a host that ensured all our needs were met without delay. Elizabeth really made our time in Oregon a memorable one by providing a warm atmosphere and recommending many local places for us to visit. If we visit Oregon, or the Portland area, again we'll definitely see if this place is open for us to stay!"
15815105,714161328,2020-12-07,374219209,Jennifer,"I stayed in two different rooms over my 3 week stay. The Manor Room is large and spacious. I was able to quarantine safely after travel during COVID, telework comfortably and even do my workouts with plenty of space!  Popped over to room #2 for a few days due to a previous reservation and loved the Elephant room too. Even though it was smaller it had everything I needed. Nicely updated bathroom as well! Would stay in either room again happily."
15815105,714297059,2020-12-08,374219209,Jennifer,Cannot say enough good things about my stay here! I had shifting plans and had to bounce between rooms of Elizabeth’s but she was so very accommodating. The Elephant Room and the Bird room (the big room) were both lovely and well appointed. And the pumpkin bread she made was GREAT!
15815105,714595369,2020-12-10,171719988,Leif,This is our second time staying here and we absolutely love it! Best host ever! Super clean!
15815105,717246809,2020-12-21,59378167,Paul,This spacious suite has a very comfortable king size bed and all the amenities you can possibly need.  I cannot recommend this place enough.  You will not be disappointed and will love the fresh baked goods!
15815105,718453611,2020-12-26,44452624,John,Great room with TV and computer hookup. Warm and well decorated.
15815105,719216336,2020-12-28,219983607,Rebecca,We love it here and have stayed many times now. Elizabeth is a wonderful host and goes above and beyond to anticipate and meet her guests needs.
15815105,719455230,2020-12-29,362360664,Rick,"Elizebeth has a charming, well maintained, vintage home to spend some time in. It’s a great Salem location, so close by to many cafes restaurants. I’d come back here!"
15815105,719830946,2020-12-30,25523957,Kyle,Elizabeth went above and beyond with accommodating my very late arrival and the room was spotless and welcoming! Such a great host!
15815105,722250253,2021-01-05,173293467,Abigail,Amazing! Thank you Elizabeth!
15815105,725038521,2021-01-17,384469411,Mark,"Lovely, quiet home with quaint feel. Lovely accommodations with some great common areas. Our host was responsive to our questions and answered us right away."
15815105,728227453,2021-01-31,189822787,Tara,"Elizabeth has the best place for a quiet writer to get some work done. This was my third stay at the Vista Manor and the experience never disappoints. Her prices are more than fair, the space is gorgeous and extremely clean, and it is beautifully decorated. Elizabeth is great at communicating. There was a city-wide power outage and Elizabeth made sure I knew about it and she called the city immediately to find out what was going on. I appreciate this so much. The amenities she provides are the nicest and I really appreciate the little touches. I would highly recommend staying at Vista Manor!!!"
15815105,728640162,2021-02-02,211726581,Angela,❤
15815105,728763260,2021-02-03,211726581,Angela,"This place is such a treasure. <br/>Elizabeth is an incredible host.<br/>King size bed, claw foot bath tub, fireplace in my room, pool and hot tub. Whats not to love? <br/>I will definitely be back."

15815105,731342772,2021-02-14,244613564,Dave,"Elizabeth keeps a truly excellent B&B in the old school tradition. Beautiful location, Excellent hostess. Interesting home with the traveler in mind. We stayed in an unusual weather disaster and  she made a special effort to take care of our needs despite personal adversities."
15815105,733445787,2021-02-21,8939076,Jeremy,"The house was very nice and central to town. We didn't see photos of the hot tub beforehand but it is a nice modern tub, though would get crowded with more than 2 people. The shower/tub in the room is a clawfoot tub and requires a large step to get in and out so that could be an issue for those with mobility problems. The host was very responsive to messages and accommodating. We were very happy with the space overall."
15815105,733936756,2021-02-23,191235179,Hannah,Elizabeth’s home is beautiful! Our stay was amazing and we had a great time!

House was amazing and the room we  stayed in had an amazing bed/mattress ( we had the private with our own bathroom). Cant wait to return with my fur baby. Definitely recommend 100%
15815105,737285732,2021-03-07,390168989,Lucrecia,"A cozy, quiet place to relax from the daily hustle. Elizabeth goes the extra mile to make you feel welcomed."

We were very surprised by how quaint this lovely place was and how attentive our host was to our questions. I just wished we could have stayed longer. We will be back!"

15815105,744686631,2021-04-02,96094824,John,Elizabeth is a great host.   Her place is centrally located in south Salem....and is convenient to all places of interest to me.  We’ve stayed with her before....and we’ll stay with her again.
15815105,745033715,2021-04-03,15228614,Rick,"Outstanding experience! My daughter stayed in room 4 with my 9 year old daughter. The king bed and spacious room were fantastic! The fireplace is such a cozy touch, but we didn’t use it. My daughter loved ALL the available snacks! (Fruit, fresh banana bread, packages of oatmeal, chips, cup-o-noodles, Oreos, Biscoff cookies, peanuts, yogurt, tea, coffee and bottled water), and she even brought up her blender so I could make my smoothie! There were plates and mugs, paper towels, silverware, mini fridge! <br/><br/>There were plenty of toiletries in case something was forgotten in the packing at home. We enjoyed the hot tub the following morning and didn’t even hear ANY of the other guests our entire visit!"
15815105,745710564,2021-04-04,249883874,Charles,"This stay was great! This was the most well supplied stay I have ever used. Anything that you could have forgotten was available. There were snacks and drinks waiting for us in the room. Any toiletry you could think of was waiting for you in the bathroom. Extra blankets, towels, a robe for the hot tub - it was all there! Elizabeth even offered us firewood for the fireplace in our room in case we got chilly and wanted to make things more interesting. Just perfect!"
15815105,748078420,2021-04-11,187764282,Sue,"Wonderful space, has everything you need. Great location next to lots of shops & restaurants."

15815105,757386300,2021-05-11,133384876,Tara,"Really cool property and nice hostess. It’s a giant old house carved into suites. Remind me the bed and breakfasts of ole, but not as stuffy. I came as a staycation to soak in the hot tub, and it did not disappoint. The pool and patio is cute with nice landscaping and some lounge chairs. If you know how hard it is to find Airbnbs with hot tubs, you’ll think this is a bargain. I’m all about the hot tubs when it comes to Airbnbs, personally. That’s what makes it vacation!"
15815105,760198129,2021-05-19,68908532,Erica,"lovely, comfortable, clean and quiet!"

15815105,765159615,2021-05-31,51259252,Lacey,"Elizabeth was so hospitable to us while we were in Salem. The home and grounds were beautiful and we got to enjoy a lovely hot tub sunset :)  She even had her daughter bring up some ice when my knee was aching from a long hike. <br/><br/>I would only recommend that you don’t stay here if you have a cat allergy. There were several cats on the grounds, and my allergies were pretty bad during our stay. We did end up purchasing a Neti pot at the most wonderful natural grocer right around the corner!"
15815105,765693575,2021-06-02,66235328,Heidi,Elizabeth was so welcoming and kind! We loved our spacious room and all of the extras to make us feel at home! The bed was especially soft and so comfortable! We had a great nights sleep! We will definitely return next time we come to Salem!

Cold water and many varieties of yogurt in the fridge, fruit, pastries and even a variety of toiletries in case you forgot to pack something.  The room was very spacious and the king-sized bed was soft and comfy!  I will definitely be back."
15815105,770136756,2021-06-13,350748,An,"This was a perfect place to stay on my road trip with my dog. The room is spacious, parking is plentiful and location is very convenient!"

The host has obviously given a lot of thought to the various needs and comforts of her guests. The place is at least as nice as advertised and communications with the host are excellent. This room was an especially good value especially compared to the hotel options nearby. Highly recommended."

I cannot think of anything Elizabeth could have done to make our stay better. The house and grounds are lovely. Elizabeth is very responsive if you have questions plus she is just a great person. I wholeheartedly recommend staying here.
15815105,405108441164600868,2021-07-12,6795482,Kate,"Elizabeth's wonderful manor house is a joy. We have stayed there twice before while work was being done on our nearby house. This time, we booked a room for out-of-town guests, as our home is again not quite ready for visitors. They absolutely loved the room, the whole beautifully appointed house, and the wonderful grounds. They were treated so kindly, they said they would love to stay there again."

The historical house is beautiful, and my room was spacious, private, and full of personal touches as well as supplies a traveler might have forgotten. I appreciated a friendly face and brief orientation when I arrived, the menagerie of outdoor pets, and the many thoughtful details (homemade bath bombs! homemade hazelnut bread! fresh fruit! I will be coming back when I return to Salem."

Fresh bread and fruit, coffee and tea in the room, it all felt like a wonderful home away from home. Wish we could have stayed for longer!"

Elisabeth has covered every detail and the space is sparkling clean. The best accommodations I’ve ever had at an Air BnB. I would 100% stay again. Also a great price!! Thanks Elizabeth"
15815105,431908764247119860,2021-08-18,8224608,Jeff,What a great experience. This is what AirBNB intended when it began. Beautiful home with a story to tell and inviting host.

15815105,435491121986566362,2021-08-23,16795320,Paul,"This is a wonderful place to stay…physically charming and attractive, comfortable bed, bath, etc. in a beautiful, well maintained grand older home. Additionally, Elizabeth has thought of everything you might need to facilitate your stay. We ate our take-out dinner at the charming table for two, looking out over the garden area in the back of the house. Cups, plates, serving ware, microwave, fridge, coffee maker, extra towels, blankets…on and on… everything was provided. We will definitely plan to return and spend 2+ days there."
15815105,437650313796286678,2021-08-26,191138737,Rae,"This place is beyond gorgeous, cue the Snow White enchanted cottage feels. The room we rented was cozy, bright, and decorated meticulously. The creature comforts were beyond thoughtful. The host was always helpful and quick to respond. I’d stay here again in a heartbeat. This home is a gem."

15815105,443539101409573300,2021-09-03,154340318,Kate,A bit of bliss in an otherwise busy world.  I felt safe and secure exploring the surrounding area..  It has the benefits associated with a downtown (close to grocery and restaurants )  combined with  the quietness of an established neighborhood. The home itself is peaceful with a slice of history   and the hosts have thought of everything.  It reminded me of the hostels of Europe-low key and inviting.
15815105,444172989990096144,2021-09-04,43041387,Deeanna,This is a wonderful place to stay.  Elegant yet feels like home.  Elizabeth is a super host.  The hot tub and swimming pool are an added bonus.  We definately will return.
15815105,445653928427572728,2021-09-06,191416609,Patricia,"We expected a good visit but this was so much more.  If you want a cozy, warm, intimate experience you will not be disappointed.  Everything that we needed was right at our fingertips.  We were supplied with fruit, pumpkin bread, snacks, yogurt, water and so much more.  Not what your normal AirBnB would have.  The staff was more than accommodating and what we didn't have, they supplied.  But, beyond that, this establishment has a feel you can't imagine.  Mixing old with new and, aside from the inviting guest rooms, the parlor and dining room are enchanting.  It was like stepping back in time and yet all the amenities of our modern world.  The grounds are amazing and tranquil. Although it was just the two of us we could envision an entire family gathering here.  Don't pass up the chance for an awesome stay.   The Wrights"
15815105,450077040629749113,2021-09-12,160467420,Emma,Such a great experience! Elizabeth is great. So sweet and helpful. This Airbnb has everything you need. We had our dog with us and he also loved it! Bonus: fresh made bread and/or coffee cake in the mornings!

15815105,460195428879291836,2021-09-26,19000057,Connor,"Elizabeth was wonderfully helpful and checked in on us regularly. The accommodations were comfortable and more than large enough, and the location was nice and close to breakfast, coffee, and everything we needed to get to. <br/>Really great for either a one-night stay or multiple nights, and we daydreamed about bringing other couples out and booking all the rooms at once 😀"
15815105,463777686772356051,2021-10-01,391041016,Michael,"Great place. Beautiful home, very relaxing. Clean, quiet and comfortable. Would definitely recommend."

15815105,468161600411466071,2021-10-07,13281397,Nyla,"Elizabeth has created a wonderful space to shelter in, regroup, and feel at home during your travels.  So many little touches that you don't find in a lot of Airbnb's.<br/><br/>Did you forget toiletries?  She has you covered.  Need tape, or sticky pads?  She even has those.  Plus, coffee, creamer, a selection of little snacks, and even homemade banana bread out in the hall this trip for her guess.<br/><br/>The bied is soft and inviting.  The grounds are a little sanctuary in the heart of a busy commercial area.  Everything was clean and welcoming.  I will return.<br/><br/>Take the time to chat with her if you are fortunate enough to find her home. What an interesting and well traveled woman.  You won't regret it."

It’s very roomy, well appointed, very clean, & beautifully decorated. The bed was comfy & cozy. <br/>Elizabeth provides a variety of snacks, fruit, plates, mugs, cutlery, coffee, etc. She even baked some yummy banana bread.<br/>I highly recommend Vista Manor & hope to return."

15815105,474686760778193710,2021-10-16,4871287,Yoshie,"Elizabeth's place is very well located close to markets (an organic market is nearby) and restaurants (not far away) We stayed there after a visit to Silver Falls State Park and the Trail of Ten Falls. It is very close to big street, yet you only sense the restful calm of her sizeable property. Her communication and check in instructions were so clear and the room was just as shown in the photos. Fluffy fresh new towels and shower curtain, very clean and comfy spacious room with every detail considered. We did not use the little side bedroom except to store our bags. Note that there is no central heat but a fine unit in the room and probably a space heater in the little room. Lovely pear bread and fruit and yoghurt were provided with plates and paper towels and a gallon of water. A short but very good stay, we enjoyed the privacy as the suite is on the opposite side of the hall from her other rooms and over the living room."
15815105,475386026099910977,2021-10-17,366026160,Christine,"My stay at Elizabeth's was short but lovely. From the moment I drove up the driveway I was charmed by the house and decor. The house is only a ten minute drive from a cute little downtown area with restaurants and bars. I stayed in the master suite, which was spacious and cozy all at the same time. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. And on my way out a delightfully friendly kitty stopped me for some attention. Couldn't have had a better stay, and I definitely hope to return!"
15815105,480432146547025163,2021-10-24,154340318,Kate,Private and quiet.
15815105,483350940978262134,2021-10-28,159084947,Steve,"My wife and I both agree that Elizabeth's place was one of the best airbnb experiences we have had! The house is beautiful as are the surrounding grounds and our suite upstairs was very wonderfully appointed, private and comfortable. The extra touches of homemade bread and fruit each morning was much appreciated and we had everything we needed! <br/>We highly recommend Elizabeth's beautiful  home!"
15815105,487688238711809417,2021-11-03,4314385,Tiffany,"We enjoyed our stay, the room was beautiful. Loved the decor and the bathtub. The room is huge, and has lots of amenities. It was also very quiet at night. Lots of cute animals on property too! Now possible drawbacks: The bed is super soft, kind of sinking feeling, so if you like firm you may have trouble sleeping. Also, I am not sure there is actually a washer and dryer here. When messaged the host asking about it she never answered me. When I booked it was listed as an amenity, but I couldn't find it anywhere. Besides that, it is a really great place and we would love to try out another room in the future."
15815105,488382955022408875,2021-11-04,131647490,Christina,Charming beautiful space. Highly recommend very thoughtful touches

15815105,505815425178289000,2021-11-28,177382740,Brian,"My wife and I absolutely loved, loved loved staying at Vista Manor with Elizabeth! So many positive things to be said I don't even know where to start.<br/><br/> Elizabeth's home is a gorgeous Tudor home built in 1933 with an elegant dining room and living room area replete with hardwood floors, beautiful furniture, amazing French doors, chandeliers, an awesome fireplace, surrounded by a beautiful wooded lot with tall trees and foliage. What a peaceful, tranquil spot just a couple blocks from shopping and restaurants. Driving onto the property was like driving into a different world. <br/><br/>Our room was even better! We had the largest of four rooms available. It was very spacious, high ceilings, tastefully decorated and furnished, a brick fireplace, a large Persian rug, hardwood floors, comfortable chairs, a desk, a dining table, easy to use heater/AC operated by remote control, a very comfortable king size bed, ceiling fan, lots of windows everywhere looking out to the rear patio and wooded lot as well as a view of Salem from atop the hill.<br/><br/>The bathroom is equally spacious with a stained glass window, an antique claw foot tub and brass plumbing with porcelain knobs, plenty of extra toiletries, lots of clean towels, and immaculately clean.<br/><br/>The small second bedroom was equally well appointed with a single bed, a clothes butler, iron and ironing board, and a closet full of extra towels, fans, bathrobes, and other useful creature comfort items. Elizabeth has thought of every detail including fruit and fresh pumpkin spice bread in the hallway, and in the entry of the room a fridge, dishes and utensils microwave, snacks, and water chilled in the fridge.  The level of hospitality is unmatched in my numerous experiences with Airbnb's in the US and abroad. Truly exceptional. <br/><br/>This was our wedding weekend and Elizabeth was incredibly responsive and helpful in every way leading up to our arrival, coordinating with me in the delivery of floral arrangements for the room and the wedding. She even left a thoughtful card and a bottle of French sparkling champagne for us in the room. It was just above and beyond in every respect.  <br/><br/>Elizabeth and her sister Lauren were so gracious, friendly, and kind to us, making our special weekend that much more enjoyable and memorable. My wife commented that this is our new home away from home when we visit the area...which will be often. <br/><br/>Thank you Elizabeth and Lauren, your home is a slice of heaven. Thank you for sharing it with us. You are the best! Lisa and I look forward to seeing you again soon."

We stayed in the largest room, the King Suite. There was plenty of room to sprawl out and be comfortable. We appreciated all the extras such as yogurt, snacks and coffee maker. Elizabeth also provides bathroom extras in case you have forgotten something like makeup wipes, sewing kit and toothbrush. I got a long glimpse/view outside of the window at the large bunny having breakfast. The property was nice. This was our first Airbnb and we will use this location and others in lieu of hotels when traveling."

They said that everything was excellent and Elizabeth provided so many little extras that it was much better than a nice hotel stay. They also found Elizabeth very friendly and accommodating. (This was booked for them to try, as they weren't certain they would like it better than a hotel. It also saved a little $ compared to the hotel they had been staying at."

The room, however, would've been perfect to fit the three of us. It was nice having our own mini-fridge, microwave, bathroom, and coffeemaker. Also, my girlfriend liked the fruit that was kindly put out as a nighttime snack and even tried the delicious muffins one morning. Overall, it was a great stay!"

15815105,655181069206862276,2022-06-22,158466383,LaJuana,"Elizabeth's Vista House was the most pleasant and relaxing b&b I have stayed in. The bed was luxuriously comfortable even for someone like me who prefers a firm bed. The room a/c allowed me to create the perfect temperature for restful sleep in this quiet house. The furnishings were clean, comfortable, and tasteful, and there was plenty of hot water for a good shower or a soaking in the clawfoot tub. Elizabeth took care to provide a variety of snacks and home-baked goods, even letting me know when warm bread had just been put on the serving tray outside my room. The view of the gardens from my window made me wish I had more time to relax and enjoy them, something I hope to do on my next trip to Salem. Elizabeth's Vista House deserves more than five stars!"

Everything was squeaky clean, from the floors to the bathroom, carpet, dishes, dinnerware.  I really enjoyed the bird motif, it was consistent without being redundant ...Elizabeth's  art pieces drew me in and captured my curiosity!<br/>So much to like...my room was just huge, nice and cool, large tv, snacks, lots of coffee and coffee mate, oatmeal, freshly baked breakfast treats!  There is bottled water and even a very large bottle to fill the kuerig with. <br/>There are so many nice towels, a claw foot tub, beautiful original wood floors, the king bed was divine, if only I had more time to lounge in it. Sleep was wonderful. <br/>Outside, there are two delightful kitties.  There are several restaurants: Thai, sushi, 5 guys, and an extremely proper NY pizza, all just a stroll down the block!  <br/>All in all, Elizabeth's stay far exceeded my expectations and I would love to go back!  Thank you for a lovely stay!!"

Bright space with windows all around with lovely views of the gardens. Large, beautiful space. Included an extra room with twin bed and good closet space. She thought of everything. Close in location.  It was wonderful after a day out to come home to this place. I would definitely recommend that others pick this airbnb."

15815105,739202548607548233,2022-10-16,107032982,Lindsey,"This might be my favorite airbnb spot so far. The house is absolutely lovely, the room was half the size of our house! The landscaping outside is worth mentioning because they clearly put a lot of effort into it. The location is ideal for anything you would need. My son loved watching the ducks and chickens run around the backyard. Every single detail was thought of for our stay in the sense of supplies. The care package in the bathroom with extra toothbrush, wipes, etc was greatly appreciated. Our host was so welcoming, accommodating, and friendly. 10/10 would recommend. Honestly I would come back here just for some R&R..."
15815105,741364738888995813,2022-10-19,477666035,Andrea,"Lovely well-tended place,  with an abundance of space for airbnb guests and visitors.  Very separate from host's living space.  Very comfortable bed,  spacious room (I was in the Bird room) with fun and pretty decor fitting the house style.  Large well-equipped bath with a lovely stained glass window and claw foot tub/ shower.  Elizabeth provides plenty of supplies from cotton wipes to bandaids to sewing kit! Small fridge,  coffee maker,  supplies- she's very generous.  Everything was clearly communicated and responses were timely.  Elizabeth is a lovely host with a lovely home. Location in South Salem was perfect for my needs,  ample parking, lovely setting off of the street in a hill. Quiet and friendly with lovely outdoor space,  geese, chickens- but only if you want to see them!  Highly recommended."

It’s either cozy fires or floating in the pool. Elizabeth is an excellent host, always attentive, and the house is amazing. Elizabeth, if you ever choose to sell, I can see being an Airbnb host in my future.  Taking over this dream property would be an honor!"

She allowed my privacy the first couple of nights, then because of the extreme weather conditions was very communicative and accommodating. She went well above and beyond! Had a very charming experience!! Would love to return."
15815105,789235180002069620,2022-12-24,260155426,Kay,"While traveling, what better place to be in during an ice storm!  Elizabeth built a fire for us in the great room, which was so cozy and decorated very lovely, complete with a tree and collections of ornaments and santas,  all colorful and cheerful for Christmas.  Because we and the other client weren't able to go out for food on our second night there, Elizabeth and her family invited us all to a lovely, yummy dinner in the family dining room.  We had comfortable dinner conversations and were treated to a beautifully set table with bright candelabras as well.  We have shared the information with friends and do plan to stay with Elizabeth again one day.  Happy New Year!!!"
15815105,790721876813875903,2022-12-26,249250076,Gerri,It was a comfortable place to stay close to where our kids live in Salem..<br/>We're heading back in a couple of weeks and looking forward to staying in the even bigger Suite!

15815105,795017130867952901,2023-01-01,244685815,Stephanie,"We really enjoyed our stay. The house we beautifully decorated for Christmas. The amenities--it seemed like everything was thought of. I'm a person who has a lot of scar tissue thus requiring a very soft bed. The bed was a little hard for me, But I found a foam mattress in the closet which I put on top of it and there were plenty of extra sheets, so those solved that issue for me. We really appreciated all the thought that went into this AirBnB!"
15815105,800865036979105690,2023-01-09,149711447,Natalie,"Very responsive host, just as advertised!<br/><br/>Attention to detail. <br/><br/>Thank you for your hospitality!"

15815105,824057084306856041,2023-02-10,38835386,Stacey,"Elizabeth is a great house and her home is even more lovely! It’s like staying at a bed and breakfast. Everything you could need, or want, was in the room or readily available. My husband and I stayed in the King suite with our dog and LOVED all the bird decor. Seems like each room has its own little decor theme - next time, I may be opting for the elephants. Even our dog was calm throughout the night, which is rare in “hotels.” <br/><br/>Also, there are chickens and they are so fun to watch! Big chicken fan and I enjoyed their presence, as well as the ducks, on property. <br/><br/>Will definitely stay again the next time I’m in Salem!"
15815105,833406191274706595,2023-02-23,94685818,Kim,We have stayed with Elizabeth many times before and we enjoyed our stay this time as we always do!

Each room has a theme, and they are all decorated beautifully. I have been made to feel very welcome, and couldn’t ask for any better place to stay."

16001174,668123119512665333,2022-07-10,73744913,Emily,"This is such a great place to stay! I’m a travel nurse and my partner and I stayed at Victoria’s place for 9 months. We ended up extending my contract twice because we loved it so much! It’s spacious and cozy, we felt right at home immediately. Victoria is SO sweet, she was super quick to respond anytime we had a question or issue. Her husband Don lives intermittently in the apartment next door so he was around to fix anything broken and planting flowers in the flower bed. The neighborhood is ADORABLE, and it’s a super short walk to the beautiful Bush Park (and the hospital, so it was perfect for me). I could not recommend this place more!"
16690039,126805011,2017-01-14,38268923,Joanne,"Christine is a wonderful Host, she is fun and clear and warm. I loved her library and the art, a musician and artist as well. Simply a lot of goodness rolled into one delightful person! "

16690039,133467987,2017-02-22,14418220,Briana,"Christina was very accommodating! She was flexible about checking in late, as we were driving home to Seattle from SF on a road trip. She even upgraded us to the basement unit, which had its own private entry and we had the entire place to ourselves! The check out was late too, so we were able to sleep in and really enjoy the place. I definitely recommend booking with her!"
16690039,134330117,2017-02-26,4371449,June,"Had a beautiful time with these dear people! The bed was very comfortable, and place was quiet -- we had a great rest! They made us feel very much at home and welcomed! Enjoyed the little talk-time in the morning, and they made us feel comfortable to make our coffee and sandwiches for the trip. Highly recommend them and their comfy cozy space! "

The house is close to the capitol and we were able to walk there for our business which was very convenient. We hope to come stay again in the future.

16690039,142120754,2017-04-06,113161020,Ryan,Christinas place is located in a wonderful quiet neighborhood but is still super close to the capitol and downtown. <br/><br/>The house is older but they have done amazing things with it to make it feel like the perfect home and we were very comfortable.<br/><br/>Christina was awesome at communicating and extremely flexible with my fluctuating schedule.  Her fiance was  gentlemenly and gave us the best suggestions on what to do and where to eat. <br/><br/>I'll definitely stay here in future travels.

Christina was super prompt in our correspondence which was much appreciated. I noticed that her and her husband were very conscientious of being quiet at night and in the mornings.  Everything was clean and tidy. Will stay here next time we are in town. "

I felt instantly comfortable and welcomed into their home; they were both very accommodating while I was stranded waiting for my vehicle repair.  Peaceful back yard/garden area to sit and enjoy the sunshine. Was about a 20-25 minute walk to the downtown area. Thank you for the lovely stay!"

16690039,154677550,2017-05-25,58751800,Sarah,A lovely little home! I only stayed for one night but the home was tidy with WiFi. There was not a lock on my room door and the hosts had another air bnb guest so I didn't feel comfortable leaving any important items in my room unattended. Otherwise a great stay!

16690039,189771515,2017-09-02,91863876,Kat,Christina and Arnaud were fantastic and friendly hosts! They gave us suggestions for places to go and really made us feel at home. Would definitely stay again!
16690039,190235863,2017-09-03,52188053,Aditya,"The communication was excellent, bedroom was clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay again at Christina's place."
16690039,191470670,2017-09-07,106952006,Louis,"Lovely place, if renting the hole house is ever an option for you I would highly recommend. Otherwise know that this is very much a quiet and respectful shared space. Don't make mess to clean up later, don't expect mess"

16690039,194948751,2017-09-17,138965246,Michael,Nice place and great location. Christina and her husband are very friendly and accommodating.
16690039,197165974,2017-09-24,4470365,Kristen,"Stayed only one night at Christina's, which was just 2 blocks from where my friends were getting married the next day. Lovely backyard, sweet, walk-able neighborhood, and cool old craftsman.  Christina was welcoming and made me feel right at home.  Great value for the money!"
16690039,197539990,2017-09-25,5242627,Athena,"Great hosts, great place, great value!"
16690039,198846362,2017-09-30,74251196,Michael,"Great price for good little set up. The location is a very short drive to downtown, the Capital building, etc. The neighborhood is nice and quiet. The house was clean and comfortable. The bathroom is shared, but we were never inconvenienced by that. We were just passing through town so we did not get a lot of time with Christina and Arnaud, but the brief interactions were delightful.<br/><br/>Our favorite part of our visit was all the friendly kitties in the neighborhood."
16690039,199366797,2017-10-01,38869023,Hannah,Quiet place to stay not far from downtown. Simple and easy!

16690039,202075370,2017-10-09,124294536,Tricia,"Darling newlywed hosts, loved their decor and sweet hospitality! Walking distance to anywhere you’d want to go. I was in town for Family Weekend at Willamette... I almost don’t want to share that it was the perfect location as I’d like to find it available again for the University’s events -  lol! I was a Airbnb virgin... this was a fantastic first experience!"
16690039,203250496,2017-10-14,924690,Stephen & Rebecca,"Christy and Armaud are good ones. We stayed in the front room. It seemed like a quiet area which is great. Space heater and fan available. It's right by the front door and off the living room, so be okay with sharing space. Nothing fancy, just a bed to sleep on and nice people. Eezy peezy."
16690039,203845842,2017-10-15,41820879,Tomas,"Christina is great host, we had really nice stay there, clean, quiet room. Just 10min walk to the train station. Than you..."
16690039,204127045,2017-10-16,111655790,Sam,This is an older home so don't expect much for what you pay
16690039,209734577,2017-11-05,16595578,Rory,"Like a lot of Oregonians, I’m guilty of not checking out our capital city enough. So I booked a two night stay at Christina’s so that I could actually “sightsee” in Salem. Her place is located in a nice historic neighborhood very close to a small university and with easy access to downtown and the river. I know because I both ran and walked between them multiple times. The house itself is very nice and the room cozy. If you’re coming to Salem, check out Christina’s place. You won’t be disappointed!"
16690039,211402677,2017-11-12,40748749,Siera,Really cool house with a lot of character. Room was clean with a nice bathroom.

16690039,216630192,2017-12-04,23631008,Laura,"Nous avons passé une nuit chez Christina, ils ont été très sympathique avec nous, le quartier est calme. La chambre étais propre mais beaucoup trop encombré et la salle de bain n'était pas propre."

16690039,226854717,2018-01-12,5942808,Brittany,"Christina's house is lovely. The whole neighborhood has real charm, and is conveniently located near the Capitol. Cozy bed, friendly hosts, and bear claw tub!  This was my first time at Christina's place, but I've already re-booked for my next trip down to Salem!"
16690039,227042504,2018-01-13,34846724,Elise,Christina & Arnaud are kind and welcoming hosts. Communication was always timely and clear. Their home is a wonderful place to stay in Salem! I loved the piano in the room! I look forward to my next visit.
16690039,230698824,2018-01-28,53304593,Robert,"The accommodations were exactly as described. I had little interaction with Christina as I left early each day and returned late each night, but Christina had everything arranged/supplied for my visit and I could not have asked for anything more.  I will definitely stay with Christina upon my next visit to Salem."
16690039,230963517,2018-01-29,145179153,Travis,"Didn’t get to stay very long at Christina’s, but I got a chance to meet her for a little bit,  super helpful and friendly. I enjoyed my stay, I was comfortable.  Her house has some really cool character to it. I definitely enjoyed it. Would recommend it for sure."
16690039,233033206,2018-02-07,126489791,Nikki,Christina's place reminds me of the Victorian houses in San Francisco. Their place is conveniently located near downtown as well as the hospital. I appreciate Christina and her husband's hospitality.

16690039,244519568,2018-03-18,66511376,Charlie,"Christina's place is in a great location if you want to be near the Capitol. She is a welcoming host. I only stayed two nights, but when I mentioned that the bed was pretty soft, she made up a much better for me bed with a firm mattress in another room that did not have a guest that night."
16690039,246646093,2018-03-25,170048779,Johannah,"An amazing couple with a beautiful space in a very quiet neighbourhood. I felt welcome, comfortable and at peace. As my first airbnb stay, I was extremely impressed and hope to stay again."

16690039,270616273,2018-05-29,181943630,Edison,"Very beautiful house with classic and charming furniture. Close to every monument In Salem. I had to use the Supreme Court library and it was a few steps from the house, also the train station is very close. The hosts were not there but they still cared that everything was alright, Alex the neighbor is a very lovely person, she was very helpful and we had a very nice talk.<br/><br/>I hope to come again and stay for more time."

Lots of comfy couches in living space. <br/><br/>Christina was always quick to reply to my queries, and I had a chance for a quick chat with her in person, which was lovely. I can't wait to come back, and to have a chance to use the beautiful outdor spaces as well!"
16690039,277156162,2018-06-15,156861784,Alyssa,"We didn't get to meet Christina but she had great communication and was very kind. Everything went very smoothly and we loved staying in their comfortable, cozy home!"

16690039,313070258,2018-08-24,55458879,Jordin,The bed is a futon but it was an easy check in and an easy drive from Portland on our way to the trail of 10 falls. Great for the price

16690039,326584123,2018-09-22,48272219,Scott,Sweet house and Christy very good about communication. Comfortable stay and as described.
16690039,328641138,2018-09-26,196048502,Jameel,"This place is worth going to over anything else in Salem. I am actually a Salem native that is up here visiting family. Living in LA and driving up here is difficult. Family and friends unfortunately didn’t have a place for me to stay. Hotels were over 80 dollars a night with tax. I looked to Airbnb but the problem was a lot of places are too Far East in Salem or grungy looking and bloody expensive. This home is in a decent part of town, close to downtown. It’s old, but not so old that things are out of date. It’s a beautiful house and check in was a breeze. The husband was super accommodating and allowed me to stay late to get my laundry done. It felt like not only was I in my hometown, but I was visiting another friend or family member. Everyone, including other guests were super kind. The bed is a little firm, but I dig it. I slept very well. The old-style shower was definitely fun. Towels and linens were clean and available. I will definitely stay here again the next time I’m in salem visiting family. Trust me when I say I’ve looked at other Airbnb’s in the area and nothing else can beat this one for the price."
16690039,328985861,2018-09-27,7530981,Mary,"This Airbnb was sweet surprise, though given our communication with Christy beforehand, we expected it to be great. Both Christy and her husband are very accommodating and generous. The house is comfortable, the location perfect for us."
16690039,331135099,2018-10-01,2750480,Rene,"Christina has all the details covered, just look around at all the signage that explains all the possible questions we could have. This was our first Air BNB experience, so we weren’t sure what to expect, but we’re hoping future trips are this great and thought out. She was great at communicating the details and made her home feel like our home. Highly recommended."
16690039,332188754,2018-10-04,127086010,Fredrick,The room was very  comfortable and hosts  very friendly.  I was surprised on how close to town it was and some great places to eat. Make sure you try    Word of Mouth    great breakfast and only a short walk
16690039,333774767,2018-10-07,55039313,Jj,Christina and Armand were delightful and responsive hosts.

16690039,339701689,2018-10-21,180053534,Frederic,"If you need a place to stay in Salem you can’t beat it for the price. Nice comfortable bed with clean linens. Shared bath- shower a little small (claw foot tub) and awkward, but lots of hot water and very functional. <br/>All and all a great deal..... I’ll be back!"
16690039,342495546,2018-10-28,43896999,Lu,"Description of the room is as written.  In addition, this older home is full of character and is located in a safe, quiet, walkable neighborhood of unique older homes.

Although I was having issues with the app, Christy and Arnaud were very quick to connect and help me have all the information I needed. I didn’t use the kitchen as I had commitments elsewhere. Bed and bathroom were clean and welcoming. Nice notes about the house share info to help you make yourself at home. Bedroom I stayed in was at the back of the house not the one pictured. It was nice to be on the east side of the house in the morning. Lots of windows to let light in when you want it and curtains to keep it out when you don’t. I enjoyed my stay and would stay again!"

Arnaud was there to greet me and I was able to meet their lovely puppy, Otter. The bedroom, bathroom and house overall was clean and met all my needs. <br/><br/>Check-in was smooth and communication was great. They are wonderful hosts and know what they are doing so you know you will have a nice stay. I appreciate that there was a lock on the bedroom door as they had other guests in the home so I felt even more secure. Most importantly, the bed is comfy and the blanket was SUPER COMFY which was nice after a long day of exploring... I need to get myself a blanket like that!<br/><br/>Thanks again, Christy & Arnaud!"

16690039,616807214,2020-03-10,243979659,Mercy,"The low price makes this an attractive place to stay.  If you only care about saving money, it's a good choice.  The place is aesthetically pleasing and in a convenient neighborhood.  It was not sparkling clean, despite reviews.  Maybe it was just the day I was there, but the floors were dirty in the bedroom and bathroom.  Also lots of neglected areas with heavy dust.  <br/><br/>I hadn't read the listing closely enough, and didn't realize how many guests could be there with one bathroom.  There were three rooms and four guests with one bathroom, which only created mild inconvenience.  There is a large dog on the property, and he came into my room.  Also, another guest had a dog with her.  Just good to know if you don't want dogs around.<br/><br/>The main reason I didn't give a better review is because the host contacted me the day I was to arrive and asked if I would switch rooms because another guest was staying for longer than I and would have to switch rooms mid-stay unless I gave her my room.  I had intentionally chosen the room I did, but I felt uncomfortable saying no, knowing that I was putting someone out.  I didn't answer right away, and then the host contacted me and said never mind, I should stay in the room I chose.  But then I arrived at the house at the same time as the other guest and felt awkward not offering to switch.  I did, and she was very grateful.  The room I ended up in was fine, but the whole experience felt strange.  I told the hosts that in the future they should throw an incentive in if they ask people to switch.<br/><br/>Because of the dirty floors and communication, I won't book again.  If you just want cheap and convenient, it's a great find."
16690039,617347021,2020-03-12,148915982,Bambi,"Wonderful hospitality, fantastic location, unique home - and i loved the back yard! I have a service dog who rarely gets to be off leash when we travel.

Communication was great, Christy let me know there would be other guests during our stay and was very thorough in explaining how to check in upon our arrival.

I asked Christy where I might store my bike and she immediately put it in a locked storage area.  I also appreciated the specific directions to the their place.  For reasons I do not understand the AirBnb G Maps  interface sent me to the wrong location. Arnaud's welcome message let me know others had also experienced location problems so I knew to put their address directly into G Maps.  It then gave me the proper directions.  Would be happy to stay there again!

16690039,832742998865150485,2023-02-22,335073358,Adedayo,Friendly host. Amazing room and house.
16690039,850148007589305397,2023-03-18,380920455,Andrea,Stopped here overnight and it was perfect. Super clean and they have a beautiful home. So many pretty house plants and a really cute front porch area with a daybed and books
17111184,137490007,2017-03-15,2874013,Rosalyn,"Jean is a lovely host. Her home is beautiful, carefully and artistically appointed, clean and bright. It is obvious that Jean takes care to provide for the comfort and convenience of her guests. The location is ideal. Close to downtown, the University, the Capital. This was my second stay with Jean and certainly not my last. The property and the host are ""super."""
17111184,157865356,2017-06-04,62342778,Tom,"Jean was very responsive during the booking process and extraordinarily welcoming when I arrived. Besides the property being better than described, Jean was nice enough to have a batch of freshly baked oatmeal chocolate chip cookies on the table for guests. They were amazing. I wasn't able to take advantage of the bicycles she offered, but there's always a next time."
17111184,162419251,2017-06-20,134971951,James,"This is the place to stay if you're bike riding through the area. Host has a bike stand and tools in a secure shed for storage. Also she has a wealth of local bike knowledge, and décor to match :) The outside garden is a paradise of shade to relax in. I appreciated the separate entry and in-room bathroom. Plus a parfait for breakfast!"
17111184,168597263,2017-07-09,15811772,Sam,"This turn of the century house is a great place to go back in time to fir and oak floors, old rocking chairs, oval rugs, really quaint. Great period furnishings with modern mixed in. Relaxing. We will visit again when in Salem."
17111184,172388873,2017-07-20,126649108,Tu Anh,"Nice, spacious and clean place. Highly recommend."
17111184,173740452,2017-07-23,138228086,Heidi,Very accomidating. Great experience!
17111184,210486635,2017-11-09,142294753,Alan,"This is a lovely old house in a great location with easy access to the things we wanted to do while in Salem. Jean is a great host that takes pride in her home and the care she shows her guests. A long time Salem resident, she is knowledgeable about the area and willing to help with information. If you are looking for a quiet restful place this is it. No TV, just conversation with your host or fellow guests."
17111184,237640390,2018-02-23,142294753,Alan,This was our second stay with Jean in her beautiful home. She is a gracious host and attended to our needs like we were family. A peaceful quiet retreat within walking distance of downtown. We would definitely stay again when next we are in Salem.
17111184,256449804,2018-04-22,59483325,Alex,She made me feel very welcome I was quite impressed with her house. She made the best breakfast
17111184,302592714,2018-08-05,174403590,Barbara,"Very clean and updated 1912 house in downtown Salem, within walking distance of eateries, parks and other points of interest. Jean's house has tall evergreens on three sides that lend privacy to bedroom windows. We left windows open all night. It was lovely. "
17111184,306506057,2018-08-12,128744096,Susan,"We stayed in the Cedar room.  It was clean, beautifully decorated and had it's own private bathroom.  There were beautiful sitting areas, a desk with stationary, a couch, a table and chairs, all with plenty of lighting.  Outside the room, there was a shared living area and a small kitchen with a refrigerator and dishes, coffeemaker, etc.  There is no air conditioning, but it was cool weather so we were comfortable with the windows open.  There is some road noise, light sleepers might want to choose a room toward the back of the house.  Jean was absolutely delightful as a host.  She was attentive, and wonderful company.  She fixes a continental breakfast included, or a full breakfast for a very reasonable price.  This was a true BnB experience.  We will definitely stay here again!  "
17111184,316707991,2018-08-31,125892566,Tricia And Amelia,"If you are coming to Salem, look no further - this is the best place in the city. I recently relocated from the DC area, and Century House became my home away from home - literally - for my first three weeks in Oregon. I cannot say enough good things about this place! Location, cleanliness, warm and inviting space, quick response time, fantastic host, Century House has it all - and to top it off Jean makes delicious home-cooked breakfasts every morning that can't be beat!<br/><br/>I had the good fortune to try out two rooms during my long stay, the Maple Room and the Cedar Room. Both were great, although there are a few differences between them. The Maple Room has air conditioning, while the Cedar Room does not, so that's something to keep in mind if you are coming during summer. The Maple Room has a bathroom right next door that is quite spacious. The Cedar Room has a smaller en-suite bathroom, with a sink in the bedroom. If you are someone who is sensitive to road noise, be advised that the house is on a busy street and there are dogs next door that like to bark a lot. It did not bother me, but if that is a concern for you I think the Maple Room was a little more insulated. The kitchenette is available to both rooms and is equipped with a coffee pot, small fridge, microwave, and two-burner hot plate sufficient for boiling water. There is a cute dining room adjoining the kitchenette and Jean always leaves homemade cookies there that are so tasty.<br/><br/>Not only is Jean an amazing host, during my stay she became a good friend. She went above and beyond, from allowing me to check-in very late, to upgrading me to the Maple Room when it was really hot outside, to driving me downtown when I didn't have transportation, to storing my luggage when I was traveling. She's also a very good Scrabble player! If you are a cyclist, you are in for a treat because Jean is passionate about the sport and knows all of the trails and places to go. I also really enjoyed the breakfasts, which were always something new each day, and it was fun to have the opportunity to meet the other guests and chat with them. Stay at Century House - you won't regret it!"
17111184,317895031,2018-09-02,42868638,Tiffany,"My husband and I stayed here with our 22 month old toddler and had a wonderful stay, I am truly grateful I found this home. Jean is a gracious host and made us feel so welcomed. She loves children and it shows in the extra touches she adds to the room. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to any family."
17111184,348900304,2018-11-15,124400237,Emily,Jean's hidden gem was delightful!  I find myself in Salem for work and chose Cedar Room just because of its proximity to my meeting location.  I ended up being spoiled for 3 days!  Breakfast was amazing - so much thoughtfulness and care.  I enjoyed getting to know and a fellow guest over coffee each day and check in - late at night!  Was a breeze.  I cant wait to return to the area to explore a bit more and will definitely stay at Century House when I do.  Can't recommend Jean's hospitality enough!
17111184,353596625,2018-11-28,9940702,Aaron,Jean is a wonderful host and the home is very comfortable. <br/>Walking distance to downtown and a number of other sites.
17111184,435217028,2019-04-09,33346460,Doug,"Jean is a superb host of an immaculate, well-furnished, restored, historic, classic Willamette Valley farmhouse. Easy drive into downtown. Great breakfast!"
17111184,491106272,2019-07-19,271246694,Chris,Jean is wonderful host and was very welcoming during our stay at her home.  The room we stayed in had lots of character with all the modern facilities we needed.  The centre of  Salem is a short gentle stroll (30 minutes) from the property.  We will certainly stay again when we are back in the area.
17111184,501482519,2019-08-03,277739108,Peng,A nice place .Thank you very much.
17111184,546677505,2019-10-13,27612461,Lisa,Jean was a wonderful host and had all sorts of thoughtful touches throughout her place.  She was very quick with a response any time I had a question.  She served a great breakfast and even asked about my dietary restrictions from the beginning which was such an added bonus!  I will definitely stay there again.
17111184,561536921,2019-11-09,172403012,Carrie,Jean was a fantastic host - very accommodating as we got in late. She responds quickly to messages and has a lovely home that was immaculate.  We wouldn’t hesitate to stay again or recommend her place to others.
17111184,602399004,2020-02-06,9633578,Christina,The place is lovely and very clean. Jean is a gracious host and treated me to a great breakfast over interesting conversation! Hope to be back soon!
17111184,618120751,2020-03-14,129712170,Patricia,One of the best B&Bs I've stayed at. I absolutely recommend Centennial House. Jean was just the best. Many thanks.
17111184,619222515,2020-03-16,13979020,De Fracia,"One of the most charming, beautiful airbnbs. Jean Your host Jean is a person of artistry, kindness and it shows in her beautiful home and the rooms for her guests. She is Your comfort and safety is foremost and she takes extraordinary care to care of the guests facilities. It was a pleasure and I will happily return to visit as her guest again."
17111184,415258400878390846,2021-07-26,338420773,Yuta,Jean is the best host I’ve ever met.
17111184,596475164828626320,2022-04-02,448686519,Nadezhda,"A wonderful place! The room was private, clean, and spacious. I also appreciated the easy walking distance to downtown Salem. And the complimentary breakfast was lovely, as well!"
17111184,618136397378064170,2022-05-02,365360793,Allison,"If you’re staying in Salem, look no further than the Century House. Jean is easily the best host we’ve ever met. She is just so lovely - from giving us a tour of the space to checking in with us throughout our stay, she was so communicative the entire time. Jean is also just so incredibly kind, a truly wonderful person to be around. The house itself is great, with a few common areas and a small kitchen for guests. Opt for breakfast - Jean makes fantastic baked goods and will leave a whole assortment of goodies for you! Overall, you can’t go wrong if you stay at the Century House!"
17111184,739957972160979676,2022-10-17,128572970,Katharine,"Close to Willamette, clean and comfortable."
17111184,759491571745415049,2022-11-13,421430312,Edward,"Will absolutely be my go-to when visiting Willamette. Wonderful host, great space and very convenient location."
17238122,668146466,2020-09-26,341040137,Caliz,Good place to stay. Host provides good house supplies. Cute decorations and comfortable rooms.
17238122,704257564,2020-10-26,23392356,Trudy,"Great location, quant and cozy cabin in the heart of Salem. I would stay here again!"
17238122,711668574,2020-11-27,13546686,Lexie,"We booked this apartment based on it’s proximity to where our family lives in Salem.  Communication was friendly, and the check in/out process was quick.  Not very clear with instructions, though... as the code changes each day, so the check out code is different from the check in code, but we had a quick response from the manager to get a new code.    We also were granted an earlier check time, but we ended up not needing it.  The flexibility was much appreciated, though.  The bedrooms are not photographed in the listing, but we took a chance based on what we saw in the other photos of the apartment.  One bedroom is off the living room and doesn’t have a door.  It has a 4-poster bed, with a somewhat run down desk and office chair.  Helpful if you’re working from home, but there’s no privacy and room feels small with the larger furniture in it.  (It looks like it was an office space converted to be a second bedroom.)  The other bedroom is off the hallway by the bathroom.  Decor was pretty neutral for both bedrooms with white blankets and linens.  The second bedroom had a unique choice in throw pillows on the bed... one says “Love” and the other says “Hip Hop”.  The bathroom has a bit of a tight squeeze, particularly between the toilet and the elongated sink/counter.  The space has great potential to be a super cute apartment.  The ceilings are fantastic, and the there’s tons of great natural lighting from all the windows.  The apartment just needs a little TLC.  Seems there are some personal items left strew about, not really adding to the decor.  For example,  there’s a random chain necklace hanging on a nail in the hallway.  In the morning, I spotted a white fuzzy sock/scarf on the bed frame.  I didn’t look too closely as I didn’t really want to know what it was.  The mix and match gives it a cluttered feel, and the space would be suited better if some older home goods were stored or given away.  The cabinets were partly empty, but then we found all the dishes still in the dishwasher.  After I noticed a few strands of hair on the bed sheets, I diverted my attention elsewhere, but couldn’t really get comfortable.  Also, we didn’t use the shower, but it took a very long time to get hot water in the kitchen sink.  The outdoor patio space is probably great in warmer seasons, but we didn’t use it as it during our stay.  Finally, if you’re a coffee drinker... bring K cups for a Keurig machine.  None were provided (as we’ve experienced in other stays), and I didn’t see other options to make coffee with the grounds we brought with us.  Overall, this AirBnB felt like we were staying in someone’s current home, and they couch-surfed at a nearby friend’s to give us the apartment for the night.  Thankful we found a place to stay in Salem, but in comparison to other AirBnBs we’ve visited, this one has room for improvement, especially for the price point."
17238122,736326147,2021-03-04,174218665,Claire,"I loved my time in Salem! Victoria’s home is so welcoming. The location is very convenient being downtown, but nestled away in a neighborhood which offers a park with miles of trials. I made great use of her patio off the front which has a large dinning table, fire pit, and grill."
17238122,698620127430057485,2022-08-21,80075463,Jennifer,"I was in Salem for a 3 month job contract and stayed in Unit #4 at Pringle Creek Flats. It is a quirky, charming little space that felt somewhat like I was living in a treehouse during my May through August tenure. It is right  next to Bush Park which served as a delightful  ""backyard"" and is also within a mile of all the downtown locations for eating/shopping/etc. If you happen to work at Salem Hospital, you really can't beat the location. During the last month I was there, the weather got pretty hot on several days, and although there is no central AC, the little plug in portable units kept the flat decently cool. Plus, the summer heat resulted in a profusion of blackberries showing up almost overnight in the abundant hedges right by where I parked my car. Delightful! I felt very safe the whole time I was there, the other flat occupants were quiet, the keyless entry was great, the laundry facilities were fine (I only had to wait once in three months to use the coin operated washer/dryer) and I would definitely stay there again."
17238122,783419258056715429,2022-12-16,198227119,Meghan,There were many disappointments with this place. The place was not cleaned. There were dirty dishes and stains on very appliances. There were issues with the bathroom regarding water temperature. Hard water in the toliet. Musty toliet smell. The amienty were not as advertised. No dish washer and paid laundry. Furniture extremely old and had stains. There was no fire alarm until I spoke up. Homeless people roamed the environment.
17238122,829138986757696039,2023-02-17,292595379,Rafael,I would use again
17238244,140091751,2017-03-27,68449058,Patsy,"Wonderful location! There's a great breakfast spot a few blocks away called Whites. I wish we had more time to walk around the neighborhood, it's beautiful!"
17238244,142332652,2017-04-07,100592459,Ann,This is an adorable house on a quiet street. We didn't spend much time in the neighborhood as we were there to see Willamette University and they kept us busy.  House is very clean and comfortable and charmingly decorated.  
17238244,143646675,2017-04-12,8025882,Iris Maria,"The is in a great spot, not too far from the Capitol. It was clean, comfortable and well appointed. "

17238244,153674103,2017-05-21,115573554,Mileah,I would stay again in a heart beat. The home was close to anything we needed but still quiet. The tub was wonderfully deep and Linda is a gracious host 
17238244,156122887,2017-05-29,75802331,Rebekah,"Linda is a great host!  The home is warm, comfortable and well-appointed. The kitchen has everything you need for cooking, the beds are comfortable and the location is close to downtown while still in a quiet safe neighborhood.  Linda's recommendations for restaurants were excellent and she was very flexible with checkin and checkout times.  Highly recommend this home for your Salem stay!"
17238244,158241189,2017-06-05,2616733,Elizabeth,"What an adorable house! We came to salem for a family get together and this house was perfect for everything we needed! Two bedrooms and a bathroom was just right for the 3 of us, and a baby too! We loved having the kitchen to cook breakfast and dinners at home, and the charming living room and decor made us feel right at home. Linda was always just a text away, and was so sweet to stop by and check in and introduce herself to see if we were all doing okay! Loved the neighborhood, and we were perfectly located in the center of salem. We loved our evenings at home and even used the DVD player for a movie night in, and there was also plenty of tv Chanel's to choose from! The beds were extra comfy too! Thanks for a great stay! We will be back again on our next visit to salem! "

A lovely quiet neighborhood with mature trees and flowering shrubs.  There's so much to do around Salem -- see the Capitol building, visit Silver Falls State Park, eat at downtown restaurants, and taste wine at the wineries of the Willamette Valley."
17238244,164300402,2017-06-26,130083237,Joel,Linda's house is cute and cozy.  Very clean and neat. The updates in the bathroom are great. The new paint and yard work make this '20's house perk up. Linda put in a new ac unit to help during an unusual heat wave in Salem. Perfect place to rest for our family. 
17238244,166214779,2017-07-03,33716929,Sheryl,"Linda's place is lovely, spacious, clean, and very comfortable. Beautifully decorated and has everything you would want. Highly recommend and would definitely stay there next time we visit Salem.  It was a perfect place to stay."

17238244,186490199,2017-08-24,12806969,John,"Stayed here during Willamette opening days, and the house was perfect for us.  Short drive to campus, short walk to a good pizza place.  The space is open, clean, and nicely decorated.  Hesitant to review because I plan to stay here on my next visit to see my daughter.  Thanks Linda!"
17238244,190257233,2017-09-03,102305979,Naticcia,This place was clean and cozy. A great place to come back to after a few days out and about.

I definitely recommend this home and will return on my next visit to Salem!

17238244,266940306,2018-05-20,188555364,Biji,We loved our family vacation at Linda's place. The house is close to downtown and within walkable distance from Bush park. The close proximity to Children's museum and Riverfront park was a big plus as we had a toddler with us. The house was clean and well decorated with artwork. Linda was very prompt in communicating with us. We had a great time.
17238244,268707160,2018-05-25,6582046,Patrick,The cottage was an amazing place to make a stop on a week of travel. Close to the main drag of Salem. Great to make a dinner and relax on the deck. Linda was an amazing host that was there to address anything needed. Will definitely stay again if available.
17238244,269052935,2018-05-26,106640641,Neha,Wonderful homely place with a feel good colorful environment.
17238244,270212670,2018-05-28,32294076,Colleen,"Linda's place is a charming, artistic retreat from the city.  While close to downtown, the tiny cottage is clean, quiet and peaceful; the ticking of the antique clock is the loudest sound in the place.  I loved the collection of art displayed in the cottage, and I will never forget the sound of my son experimenting with the baritone ukulele and the instruction book provided.  That really was a once-in-a-lifetime moment. She also provided real cream for my morning coffee, which is a service I will always, always appreciate.  Strongly recommend."
17238244,273620682,2018-06-06,174627613,Kelly,A very charming home in a charming neighborhood in a convenient location. Extremely clean and comfortable. I loved the rocking chair on the front porch and also enjoyed sitting in the sunshine on the back deck. We were sad when it was time to leave!  
17238244,275278359,2018-06-10,6377659,Curtis,The home is cute and convenient. Linda was great and very communicative. Wonderful stay in a quiet neighborhood.
17238244,276106914,2018-06-12,17729760,Claudia,"Linda was a great hostess! Very responsive and accommodating. My coworker and I stayed in the house while traveling for work, and it was a perfect space for 2 people. "
17238244,278291314,2018-06-17,13347482,Maggie,"Linda's place was wonderful! My parents and I came up for a family friend's graduation and it was exactly what we needed. Her place was very cute and extremely clean with plenty of space and the necessary amenities. Linda was very responsive with anything I needed. The arrival was easy as can be even with our very late flight.  The tree lined street was extremely quiet and very pretty. We wished we could have enjoyed the area longer. Should we find ourselves in Salem again, we would definitely use Linda's place. "
17238244,280250609,2018-06-22,66222614,Joyce,"The house is charming, beautifully decorated and landscaped,  lovely neighborhood, very close to a large park for walking along the river (with or without a four-legged friend).   A perfect spot to relax and/or base for area exploration."
17238244,280667815,2018-06-23,47705863,Kelvin,Great host with love to care hospitality unlike any others!

17238244,282202478,2018-06-26,152997751,Juels,More than an old cottage!  This cottage has been completely remodeled with modern amenities and electrical outlets.  It's spacious and clean with lots of natural light.  It would make a great place for a multi-day stay.  It's ;located close to downtown and was easy to find.  Linda was thoughtful and responsive. I'll be staying there again next time I'm in Salem...if it's available!
17238244,283400312,2018-06-29,11162497,Robby,"Very cozy, host is very accommodating."

Be aware owner lives on property in a separate cottage.  Also, there is a basement that owner uses; and we were a bit put off by the fact that there was no lock on the tenant side!  We could go into the basement, but also anyone could come into our space!  Overall, very well appointed home that has been nicely and tastefully updated.  "
17238244,290030343,2018-07-13,68914470,Jessica,Linda was very helpful and willing to work with our unexpected change for our stay. I would recommend Linda and this place to those who are interested in staying here.

17238244,291952374,2018-07-16,133302152,Christopher,"I planned a short trip and excitedly selected a day short which left me searching for an extra day that was out of my budget. I emailed Linda and she assisted in making sure I had a somewhere to stay. Linda took great care in thinking of every detail in her space to make all guests feel welcome. The units were very clean with lots of little details that made the unit feel like home. I can’t thank Linda enough for being so helpful and responsive to each and every concern. There are hosts that you never get a chance to meet, and sometimes you may prefer it that way, Linda is the exception. Awesome place — Awesome human!"
17238244,295592712,2018-07-23,21933153,Marilyn,"Linda's 1920 cottage is perfect!  Cute, clean, centrally located.  We, my sister, nephew and I, were there for a week and it was just what we needed.

17238244,301167683,2018-08-03,6029889,Robin,"This is a perfect location for Willamette University parents dropping kids off or picking them up. This is a quiet street, close to campus, with two comfortable beds and all the amenities needed for home cooking."

It was capped off by a great visit to the restaurant “word of mouth”. Highly recommend the flying biscuit and the crème brûlée French toast
17238244,305699202,2018-08-11,89549728,Leanne,"Well-appointed space that is a great place to stay. Close to downtown, but in a quiet neighborhood. "

17238244,310653446,2018-08-19,62682388,Dorea,"This is a lovely spot. It was a perfect home base for 4 adults and a child in town for a wedding. Cool, clean, and well appointed, this was the perfect home base. We enjoyed evening glasses of wine on the deck, cooking breakfasts and dinners in a real kitchen, and easy access to the rest of the city. Everything we needed!"
17238244,311661180,2018-08-21,45559444,Jeanie,"The tree lined street is the first indicator that you’ve taken a step back in time - a time when neighbors talked over the fence or visited on each other’s porches drinking coffee in the rocking chairs. This is what you will find when you stay at this bungalow. Accommodations are spotless, amenities are great and the house feels like a home. Close to restaurants, parks and the history of Salem. Will definitely stay again!!"
17238244,313082875,2018-08-24,3996911,Eli,Linda is awesome! Very accommodating and responsive. Saved me some time and money with local transportation recommendations.
17238244,314456544,2018-08-26,55030371,Abby,This home is in wonderful shape. Linda has a great eye for decorating and many updated touches make this a beautiful home to stay in when visiting Willamette University.

17238244,319925258,2018-09-07,3178842,Stephen,"Good house, good location--all you need!<br/>Despite my reading other reviews and looking at the photos, I was pleasantly surprised at how roomy the house was.<br/>Linda was a great host--she came by after I arrived, just to make sure all was good (and it was).<br/>All the amenities you'd need, and then some. (I was just passing through, so I only got to enjoy the place for about 13 hours overnight.  I wished I'd planned to stay longer!)<br/>Because I find that internet varies wildly in Airbnb rentals, I want to add that the coverage was good and speeds were fine (11 mbps and up)."
17238244,321172770,2018-09-09,28312502,Kori,"We stayed one night in Linda’s lovely home while in town for a wedding. To be honest, I’d been hesitant about the space since it described some shared area, but had no issues. Check in via the keypad was flawless, the property was spotless, the quirky decorations felt fun in the well lit, open space, and it all felt very private. We had use of the adorable craftsman home to ourselves. Linda’s communication was clear and kind, and the whole experience was wonderful. I would absolutely stay here again!"
17238244,321973270,2018-09-11,25269683,Woody & Bonnie,"Linda's place was very inviting , comfortable and sparkly clean.  I would highly recommend it!"

17238244,328988650,2018-09-27,184726435,Donna,"This home was perfect for my husband and I.  From the moment we pulled up to the home we felt at home!  Outward appearances were charming, neat as a pin, so perfect! We especially loved the tree lined street.  <br/><br/>Linda was wonderful with correspondences.  Very clear with entry and exit of home.  Very comfortable bed and loved the high windows for the gentle breeze in the evening.<br/><br/>Other family members have stayed here recently and they were just as charmed.  We will definitely be back.  Thank you Linda!"

17238244,331835846,2018-10-03,83912635,Loretta,"Linda’s home is wonderful. It was cute and comfortable for my family. We were visiting nearby wineries in the Wilamette Valley, and the place was very convenient for touring."

17238244,334997156,2018-10-10,2797485,Cynthia,"This is a great place. To stay if you are cycling the Willamette Scenic Bikeway.  It is one block off the route and close to a few restaurants.  It is well kept, spacious and very clean."

17238244,340985484,2018-10-25,217769925,Lisa,Linda was super quick with communication before and during our stay. The house is beautiful and there were games and toys for us and our son to play with. Lots of extra blankets and towels and coffee in the kitchen. There was plenty of shops and places to walk to. The park is only a few blocks away from the house. We would definitely stay here again.

17238244,358233155,2018-12-13,112712039,Tona,This was a very cute small house on a  quiet street within walking distance from downtown Salem.  The space was very comfortable and perfect for the two of us but would be big enough for a family or two couples.   We were only there for a night so we didn't get to explore too much but we did get a great walk in at Minto-Brown Park which is nearby on the Willamette River.  The home was very clean and had everything we needed to feel at home - even a Christmas tree!

After a full day of walking it was so nice to come ""home"" to Linda's clean, comfortable place. I enjoyed a nice hot bath in the sparkling clean bathroom and a wonderful night's sleep on the super comfy bed. I appreciate the nice touches like plenty of towels and high quality linens on the bed. The coffee supplies for the morning were also greatly appreciated. The neighborhood was quiet and I actually skipped one of my scheduled morning activities so I could stay in the cozy bed a bit longer. I was not bothered by any traffic noise, including trains. I will definitely be back."

When we pulled up and saw the apartment buildings nearby, we thought, ""uh oh"" noisy.  Not at all!  The area is quiet and pleasant.  Walk the neighborhood if you have a chance.  The gardens are beautiful and the  houses charming.  Sit on the porch in the rocking chairs and wave to neighbors or talk to the mailman walking by or just read a book.  Then there is the deck in the back with beautifully planted flower pots and lights at night.  Another charming reading space is in the kitchen nook with skylights.  You cannot go wrong with Linda's place. My husband walked to the convention center for a conference and Bush Park is walking distance."
17238244,463044538,2019-06-02,23251882,Michael,"A charming home in a beautiful neighborhood on a tree lined street with a gorgeous garden and outdoor  living space. We stayed here as a young family of four and the breakfast nook made for a wonderful place to start our day before the kids woke up. (The blackout shades in the bedrooms helped maximize the sleep in time for our two little boys) <br/>Everything from the complimentary coffee and creamer to the comfortable furnishings made this a home away from home. Linda went out if hey way to make sure we had everything we needed and more, even making extra unrequested accommodations for our infant. <br/>Be aware that the double beds in the rooms are best for slender or extremely cuddly couples. Fortunately we're at least one of those attributes <br/>We hope to come again soon and repeat our experience."
17238244,463659145,2019-06-03,25016286,John,"This is the perfect place for either an overnight stay while traveling through Salem, or a longer visit to the area.

Her aesthetic is vibrant and inviting, with playful art and great feng shui. She provides ample space to stretch out and relax, with an AMAZING kitchen that I literally had to tell everyone I know about. That fridge! The cute cups! Every little detail was incredibly well thought out with love and care. <br/><br/>I came here with my coworker and her daughter to study for a big test the next morning, our car was parked in front of the home. Sadly while we were sleeping we had a small break in to our vehicle, first time ever happening to this Airbnb. Linda was quickly notified, she answered and came immediately to assist with professional integrity.  She made us feel evry welcome and secure albeit the circumstance, because she was so graceful and kind to us I would not hesitate to stay again. She truly is an amazing host, as I have worked as a hotel manager before- she has more poise than I ever would during our situation. Kudos, Linda. See you soon! <br/><br/><br/>Angelena"

17238244,722850575,2021-01-08,234620250,Zach,"I'm going to preface this review by saying I'm sure Linda has written me a poor review for the night spent here and I'd like to touch on this.<br/><br/>It was my three friends and me, for the night. We are teenagers, yes, however, we are respectful teenagers. <br/><br/>Around 11 pm, we were playing water pong (no beer, just water), when Linda, the host, knocks on the door of the house without a mask on. I grab a mask and step outside to talk to her.<br/>""CAN YOU READ? ARE YOU LITERATE!?"" She spits.<br/>I'm astounded she's speaking to me like this. I try to talk her down and explain how this absolutely isn't a party (everyone was mentioned in the Airbnb guest list) and how we aren't making a mess - to no avail. She keeps telling me to ""shut up, you immature child."" First of all, the whole time, I was being as respectful as one can be and picked up on the irony in that statement. Second of all, there was nothing we had done to deserve such a reaction - I have a video taken about an hour before checkout in which the house looks better than when we got there. We really don't know what set her off. But what we do know is that she made us feel very unwelcome and very uncomfortable that night. <br/><br/>I can say it's in a beautiful location, about a 5-minute walk to the park and we enjoyed our morning in Salem and the wonderful breakfast from the Sassy Onion."
17238244,723547393,2021-01-10,130165817,Darcy,Enjoyed our stay. Such a cute little bungalow. Loved her decor and art work!

17238244,746466696,2021-04-06,667416,Ellen,"My two relatives and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in this charming cottage. We were enchanted by the stylish, artistic touches as soon as we walked in, admiring the paintings and decorations in unexpected places, such as the bathroom and the kitchen nook, which features a beautiful stained glass panel in the window. Highlights included watching a Netflix movie while curled up in front of the cozy fireplace in the evening and sitting in a rocking chair on the front porch in the morning, soaking up the sun while reading a good book. Thoughtful touches include robes for all guests, a hairdryer, and a bedside reading lamp. I look forward to staying in Linda's beautiful home again, and I hope to stay for more than one night next time."

There are some features that really stand out, the rocking chairs on the porch, the delicious espresso machine, the close-up mirror for applying make-up and the luxuriously roomy tub.  Linda was a kind and gracious host.  She was helpful. She has poured a lot of love and time into this property. This is apparent from the moment you arrive and view the plethora of flowers and plants growing outside."

17238244,392036833594484349,2021-06-24,32553731,Shannon,This quaint little home was everything we needed for a quiet and restful evening after traveling. It was cleaner than any place I have seen. I would literally give this place 10 stars if I could. Individual AC units in each room kept it perfectly cool for us. One bed is softer than the other so if you prefer either just feel them out first. The couch itself was so comfy with the fireplace I almost fell asleep there. super friendly host with excellent communication. I always felt like I could reach Linda. The location is ideal - quiet residence with easy access to a few eateries. The patio out back was nice also for relaxing with my family after a long day of travel. My only regret is that we didn't have more time here! 10 of 10 would stay again

17238244,423164092827691548,2021-08-06,36830766,Mike,"Our FAVORITE place to stay in Salem! We enjoyed running in the nearby park, sitting on the front porch in the evenings, and the proximity to restaurants and businesses. The house is updated but has a vintage charm. The location is in a neighborhood filled with other beautiful older houses making it interesting to walk or drive around the streets. We loved talking with Linda. She is a great host and ensures we are happy and comfortable. The house has everything needed for a home-away-from-home-stay.<br/><br/>Elaine & Mike"
17238244,425341098622011997,2021-08-09,127558243,Ryan,"The cottage in Salem was just like an old Sears home. So quaint with all the perfect amenities like the coffee maker, dishwasher and air conditioning in each bedroom. Plus to our delight there was an outdoor cat that our kids loved to cuddle each morning on the front porch as we sipped our coffee. It is worth mentioning that the host was on site during our stay - so as I did yoga in the morning in the living room she was gardening in the front and as we pulled up, she was always there to greet us. A lovely home but less privacy than we expected."

Home had interesting art and comfortable furnishings.<br/>Nespresso coffee maker and pods for the early morning coffee fix, front porch with rocking chairs made a nice spot to enjoy the early morning.<br/>Since we visited during a heat spike it was delightful to find each bedroom had its own AC unit.<br/>Fresh flowers made it feel even more welcoming. Our passing interactions with our host Linda were friendly.<br/>Try White’s for tasty breakfast, only a few blocks through the neighborhood and reasonably priced.<br/>All in all I’d recommend this spot as it had all we needed and was exactly as described!"
17238244,429025069464535335,2021-08-14,49268137,Kim,Lovely spot. comfortable beds.  Perfect for a couple.  Be aware the fridge is small. Storing large amounts of chilled items is not possible.

I would stay again.

Clean, pretty, well decorated, fun artwork, and everything we needed was there.  She left good clear instructions.  Linda responded right away to my request, and I got to meet her the next day when we left.  Very kind.   I was a little worried about the neighborhood because I don't know the area.  It was just fine.  Older houses, well kept, and we felt very safe.  I would highly recommend.  Hope to go there again someday."

Linda is incredibly helpful and accommodating, and quickly responds to any questions."

It has been very stressful and chaotic in our home and Linda's beautiful house was just what we needed, especially for our little baby.<br/><br/>As other reviewers have noted, the house was spotless. It had everything we could need for a multi-day stay. And it was just such a pleasant place to relax; lovely décor, beautiful neighborhood (one of my favorite in Salem), and a cozy gas fireplace. <br/><br/>In addition to the wonderful accommodations, Linda was incredibly responsive and kind.

We were allowed to use the basement washer and dryer, which was appreciated. <br/><br/>The lack of an outrageous cleaning fee was also a draw for our choosing this home. A very easy recommendation."

We came to Salem for a quiet elopement and our witnesses fell through at the last minute. We were panicked and desperate, strangers to the Salem area, but Linda came through for us in a big way! She and her friend rescued our special day with grace and humor and even took pictures and video for us! Our four year old daughter simply adored Linda and she was so genuinely warm and joyful with her. Her kindness really made the entire trip for us, she embodies the spirit of hospitality to a degree I've never witnessed from anyone else before. It truly felt like visiting family!<br/><br/>The home is crisp and clean, tastefully decorated, well-equipped, and conveniently located. The outdoor grill is a great touch and the beds were unbelievably comfortable. We wanted for nothing during our stay and brought home wonderful memories of our time there that we'll cherish forever."

17238244,681168956472022731,2022-07-28,291402216,Kevin,"We stayed one night here on a road trip and it was perfect. The house was very clean and obviously cared for, great space with AC in the bedrooms. <br/><br/>The bedrooms are a bit small so I’d you’re traveling with a group or as a family, it may be tight quarters for more than one night. Otherwise, this place was ideal and Linda was very helpful."

We were a stones throw from Salem’s center, but the street was near silent. Another plus - Linda’s home was only 15-20 minutes from several amazing vineyards and tasting rooms. Should we find ourselves in Salem again, we will definitely choose this lovely, inviting home."

Was somewhat close to a main road, which is great for proximity but can add road noise if you'd like to keep the window open for fresh air."

18004141,731952240132687887,2022-10-06,219347261,Armando,great place!
18004141,732719753468514260,2022-10-07,5081068,Tami,"I only met Sara very briefly (she was nice!), as I was in and out of the place in 12 hours. I was mostly just looking for a good night's sleep but woke up at 6am due to traffic noise from the busy road outside the window (for good and bad, it's very close) and couldn't get back to sleep."

We had the room & bathroom to ourselves that night. It's an awesome apartment on the 3rd floor, but it only felt like going up to the 2nd floor only. Definitely would stay again! & again <br/><br/>P.S.- The Star Wars photos/frames, toys, and decor in the place were super cool and mind-blowing. The Force is strong with Adam & Sarah!"
18004141,735553325211048552,2022-10-11,325527641,Oscar,This place is as advertised and we didn't have any issues apart from the heat. the room was insanely hot and we couldn't leave the window open as it backs onto a busy road that is noisy at all hours. didn't get a chance to meet the hosts but would have brought it up to them if I had/ we were staying another day
18004141,737024803544850016,2022-10-13,210923870,Claire,"I stayed here for two nights on my way to the Oregon coast. Sara is a wonderful host and is always there if you need any help. You get your own bathroom and can use the kitchen, living room etc. The apartment is close to the highway so it can be a bit loud but I didn’t hear much with the windows closed. There are also some restaurants, coffee shops and a supermarket close by. Would recommend this place for everyone who’s visiting Salem (and has a car otherwise it’s probably a bit hard to get around here)."

The home is very comfortable and conveniently located to the amenities Salem has to offer. The bed is quite comfortable and is across the street from a park. For a homey stay, I'd recommend."

18794723,763838568335536715,2022-11-19,6416503,Aj,"The highlight of my stay was Monica's great responsiveness to my messages and requests. I felt complete confidence that any question or concern I had would be addressed seriously and quickly (thank you, Monica).  Of possible importance to some guests is that there are very strong fragrances/perfumes in the air and linens. I am not 'allergic' or chemically sensitive like some, but I can imagine that this might be problematic to those who are. Another highlight for me: The house  was located near a very pleasant park that was enjoyable to walk through."
18794723,840734428364478123,2023-03-05,198017288,Jonathan,Great place!
18979869,185510990,2017-08-21,1792758,Jennifer,Sandy and Ben are the most gracious and helpful hosts I have ever met! They opened up their home and treated us like family. The location is in a very safe and friendly neighborhood with shops/a mall nearby. Sandy and Ben gave us lots of recommendations for sightseeing on the coast and hiking in the woods. I would highly recommend their place!
19144944,175396224,2017-07-28,142134873,Christopher,If you get a chance to stay here you won't be disappointed. Diane and Tom are great hosts and I hope I can stay with them again in the future if I find myself in Salem.
19144944,176392101,2017-07-30,142051763,Tricia,"This lovely home has a quiet setting with a yummy berry garden, flower garden in front and fruit trees in the back, beautifully framed with white oak trees.   The sunsets and soft breeze experienced from the hillside patio out the front sliding glass doors (with a fire pit!) were just the ticket for perfect relaxation before sleep.  The accommodations include a spacious and beautifully furnished living area, a roomy bedroom with a very comfortable Queen bed, soft bath towels and linens, and a clean bath.  The location is just minutes away from town - so it is convenient, too.  This stay was our first experience with AirBnB, and we were delighted.  You couldn't ask for more considerate and respectful hosts than Diane and Tom, either!  We will be coming back."

Tom was very helpful and stacked the fire wood in the fire pit so it was all ready to go when we used it at night. We had picked this location because it's close to Silver Falls and we couldn't have made a better decision. A lovely stay all around!
19144944,185525175,2017-08-21,38258143,Jennifer,Diane and Tom are awesome hosts!  The cottage has a lovely view of the garden and we were treated to fresh berries that Tom lovingly grew and harvested.

19144944,192654077,2017-09-10,34009991,Maia,"This is a relaxing, spacious and very quiet AirBnb. We were fortunate enough to enjoy some fresh strawberries and raspberries from the host's garden, and there was a fire pit ready to use just outside our accommodations. This AirBnb is next to a corrections facility, but it made no difference to us. You can't see it and otherwise the surrounding area is just rolling hills, trees and quiet neighborhoods. I would highly recommend this AirBnb to anyone in the area."
19144944,192977943,2017-09-11,30735502,Tim,"Tom and Diane made is feel right at home! We had our own driveway and private patio and entrance, plus a great view of the beautiful garden.

19144944,199319910,2017-10-01,19476072,Andy,"Diane was extremely friendly! The room has everything needed, including bath towels and toiletries. A few breakfast options were provided as well, which were amazing.

19144944,200525622,2017-10-05,18891983,Janaea  (Janey),"The view of the oak forest and wildlife out back, the valley and sunsets toward the front gives this private retreat an extra charm for AirBnB travelers.  Located with easy and quick access to downtown or the foothills. <br/><br/>The expanse of the interior space allows for multiple activities (e.g. exercise; family board games and TV watching) Amenities are plentiful and thoughtful."

19144944,209718866,2017-11-05,3744075,Karen,"Diane and Tom's place is great.  Large private space with a pretty view of their garden.  They are  less than 6 miles from the downtown Salem and it is an easy drive to town.   The bed was comfortable, the water hot and it was very quiet.  We liked being close to town but out in the country.  It was really nice to have a small kitchen area that had food for breakfast (yogurt, milk, just, cereal and scones).   If you wanted more, WinCo is not far away."

It is obvious that she wants you to have a comfortable stay.<br/>Communication was easy, and her suggestion for dinner just right for us.<br/>We felt very cared for and refreshed for continuing our journey home. It would be great to be there to enjoy Tom's berries!<br/>Thank you, Diane."

Diane's home was sparkling clean and she thought of everything a guest might need for their trip. I enjoyed sitting outside on the patio and taking in the beautiful surrounding. I will be choosing to stay at Diane's if I find myself needing to comeback to Salem Oregon."
19144944,264788698,2018-05-14,15319777,Elizabeth,"Diane and Tom are such a lovely couple! We had a wonderful time staying at their immaculate and peaceful place. I only wish we had time to sit by the fire and spend more time together. We were there for a Willamette University graduation, did a little wine tasting in Carlton and it was a quick drive to downtown restaurants and shopping. The ambience of their space was both very relaxing and we felt right at home. We especially liked their radio, we didn't even turn the TV on once! The welcome when we arrived, the extra touches like cheese plate, La Croix water, breakfast goodies, daily ice water, and having a fan available were all very appreciated. Their place is top of my list next time we are in Salem. ❤️"
19144944,268720375,2018-05-25,15481379,Sandra,"Spacious accommodations, gracious hosts! Nothing walkable if that's important to you. But if you're looking for a quiet respite, removed from the city, this is the place!"

They provided a warm welcome when we arrived, gave us the ""lay of the land,"" and then let us enjoy our time in Oregon.  We really appreciated the fresh, cold water (I like to have water on hand at all times), milk, juice, breakfast items and the snacks that they provided.  They had everything we needed and more. Their land is lovely, and we really enjoyed our stay. The only thing that surprised us was how close their home was to a correctional facility. It wasn't a big deal, just a little unexpected. We would stay there again."
19144944,273342638,2018-06-05,96175986,Dean,Diane and Tom were very warm and welcoming upon arrival. There were snacks and coffee provided and small touches that made you feel at home. The space was very clean and carpets were exquisitely spotless! We enjoyed our stay very much.

I slept awesome both nights.  <br/><br/>This has been the most peaceful place I have ever stayed.

19144944,284525580,2018-07-01,197184858,Carol,"It was beyond any bnb I have stayed at. Why would anyone stay in a hotel when you can have everything and more staying someplace  like this. For those that have never stayed in a bnb because they think they will be intruding,  They need to stay here.. Complete privacy, incredible hospitality and accommodations that far exceeded my high expectations.  I will be back and I will  tell anyone that will listen what an amazing place this is. Thank you Diane. "

19144944,319929886,2018-09-07,77608552,Kathy,"You will be cheerfully greeted by Diane when you arrive at this Air B&B. Her and her husband were very thoughtful and amazing hosts and guests should feel comfortable striking up conversation with them and sharing their company. <br/><br/>Diane is extremely detail oriented and leaves no personal touch unattended when preparing this one-bedroom, one-bath, personal entry space. I booked this place based on 1) location to my work training class and 2) price - which were both great. I traveled with my 6-month old and my mom (aka babysitter!) and stayed at Diane’s place for a week, so a comfortable, safe place that was more like “home” than a hotel room was what I wanted and completely got! <br/><br/>Very thoughtful details included: a nice tower fan in the bedroom, night lights all over, extra towels that felt thick and luxurious, bathroom essentials (shampoo, conditioner, soap, hairdryer, etc), wonderful snacks, WiFi, cable TV, more than ample space, private entry...the list goes on. <br/><br/>You can’t go wrong with this place and you’ll enjoy a wonderful and comfortable private space."

I can’t say enough good things about Diane as a thoughtful person, and how she went above & beyond, to make sure we felt comfortable & by letting us know she was available if we needed anything more. The apartment is very spacious & light with all details attended to for the comfort of her visitors. The main bed was comfy, as was the extra air mattress she set up with added padding, and plenty of room to accommodate an additional separate sleeping space. All other amenities were wonderful & inviting to us as guests, who look forward to seeing Diane again on a return trip to her home, when we have more time to explore the area together in the future."

We will definitely be back!!"

It is. :) Once you enter you immediately feel at home. The couch and bed are to die for comfy. The carpeting is especially wonderful to walk on in your socks. So soft and plushy.  Sadly, when we arrived the garden wasn't in full bloom or we would have had quite a lovely time exploring their huge garden and lovely yard. Highly recommended!"

The space is also larger than any Airbnb we've been in. They have a great garden too. We felt well-provider for: among plenty of other things, we were given in-season fruit, a delicious scone, and high-quality well water. The place is located at the edge of town in a beautiful, extremely quiet country environment. The final morning, we were pleasantly surprised to find that a protective kitty was lounging on our doormat at the glass door. It disappeared before we could greet it."

There is also a nice view of some city lights in the evening and if the weathers just right a beautiful sunset too!<br/><br/>Their home was the perfect retreat and respite I needed while spending time with my father during his recovery at Salem hospital. <br/><br/>Tom sent me some supportive text messages to help keep my spirits up, and Diane kept the little refrigerator well stocked and I was able to enjoy a little breakfast each morning.  I really did feel spoiled and didn’t even have to do the dishes!  <br/><br/>I couldn’t have asked for a better experience.  Tom also gave me a departing gift of some rhubarb from his garden.  <br/><br/>Thank you both for everything! <br/>Susie"
19144944,540554862,2019-10-03,53302085,Jordan,Diane and Tom's place is a wonderful getaway just outside of Salem.

We were exhausted and Diane made it super easy for us to get in. We arrived pretty late and were able to self check-in and settle in for the night. Diane also had a mini continental breakfast set up for us, which was such a nice touch since we were getting back on the road for another long drive the next morning! The location is great not to far from Portland if you want to head to the outlets or downtown. The space itself was huge and nice, and we slept soundly.

We made a suggestion about lighting the driveway entrance better. The next night they had placed reflectors with address at the driveway entrance and down the driveway. Comfortable place and exactly what we expected.

19144944,755935795,2021-05-07,34071945,Lisa,"I really enjoyed my stay here. Both Diane and Tom were really helpful. Especially Tom helping me find where to walk and get my daily step count.

There’s a make shift kitchen and she’s always available for things like ice and clearing dirty dishes while you’re out. Thanks for a quiet, cozy retreat. We will definitely be back when the weather is better so we can enjoy the view and fire pit!"

19144944,406567239543898616,2021-07-14,141748284,Linda,I would highly recommend this airbnb.  Diane and Tom have thought of everything you might need.  The space is huge and the unit is very close to lots of shopping and downtown Salem.  We felt very welcomed and relaxed during our visit.

There was a little mini kitchen area with cereal coffee and a fridge with snacks and milk and some drinks. We had more space than i expected and lots of privacy. Tom and Diane even helped us set up the firepit outside so we could make smores. Highly recommend staying here.

Their place is beautiful and cozy with gorgeous sunsets and baby deer that walk through the back yard. A peaceful place to stay outside the bustle of downtown Salem but still close to good places to eat and the spectacular Silver Falls State Park.  We hope to return in the near future.
19144944,416719923854501899,2021-07-28,412146455,Andrea,Tom and Diane provide a perfect and peaceful place to stay.  We definitely recommend and plan to return on future trips.

Diane came greet me during check in. and Tom came talk to me almost everyday cause they felt bad that I was there all alone(on a road trip alone)  the living room has more than enough space that i can put my stuff everywhere haha. the bedroom and bathroom are clean. kitchen is good, even there isn't a stove but they have a lot supply and snack for you (juice, milk, eggs, cheese, cracker, cereal, you name it) Diane came take the trash, dirty dish and feel the water while you are gone.  it was a hot week with average 100 degree during my staying, they have the AC on all the time, the basement is nice and chill, feel like two different world than outside burning air.  I cut my finger with glasses accidently, Diane and Tom help me to clean the mess and patch my finger for me. couldn't ask for better host!!  stay with them, you won't regret it !"
19144944,435482844783127308,2021-08-23,145045803,Sheli,Diane's place was perfect for us.Thete was so much space to relax and we loved how clean and tidy it was. The location was perfect allowing for a country experience that was close to everything in the city. We highly recommend and plan to stay again ourselves!
19144944,439197142594458835,2021-08-28,417881538,Ricardo,"Diane and Tom are great hosts who take into account every detail, big or small, to make our stay at their beautiful home, an amazing experience. I loved it so much that I am staying with them again when I go back to Salem in October."

19144944,457972883594440011,2021-09-23,188794729,Deanne,"This spacious basement apartment was a very comfortable and clean place for us to stay in while visiting family in Salem. Too many amenities to list, the hosts have done an incredible job of making their guests feel welcome and taken care of. Since we enjoy visiting our family here, I’m sure we will be staying at the Country Garden Retreat often!"
19144944,460203888431248064,2021-09-26,12711872,Lisa,"I had such a wonderful stay in this space! I needed an escape to concentrate on finishing a major project, and it was the perfect place to do so. Comfortable, welcoming, clean, and a gorgeous view. Diane and Tom are amazing hosts, too! So kind and great to chat with. I absolutely recommend reserving this space. I hope to visit again."
19144944,465288734095474801,2021-10-03,79856938,Jeanette,This airbnb really is walking distance to Corban. A very good  spot to visit students from!

Thank you so much
19144944,476081743226085363,2021-10-18,420147762,Stacey,This is a great place to get away from crowds but still be close to the things you want in the Salem area. The location is peaceful and the accommodations are spotless while still being inviting and comfortable. We will definitely stay here again.
19144944,477593012722482930,2021-10-20,39988204,Matthew,"One of the best Airbnb experiences I’ve ever had. A perfectly private floor in a beautiful home in a ultra quiet neighborhood. <br/><br/>Every little detail is covered with Diane, and if anything is missing, let her know and she will take care of you. <br/><br/>We slept very well and we highly recommend Diane as a host."
19144944,480493399409186658,2021-10-24,285175300,Sandra,"Our stay was great! Diane is very commutative she said hello to us when we arrived she went over everything with us. We had a nice stay it was very quiet which sometimes that’s what you need. They bathroom was fully stocked with towel and the little “kitchen” area has everything you need, she even put out water for us and refilled it when we were gone which was very much appreciated."
19144944,482581060694342903,2021-10-27,551207,Kathleen,"This home is delightful in almost too many ways to list. Sparkling clean, very comfortable, lots of space. My favorite parts: the rural setting and great view of Salem; the wonderful color coordination of interior spaces (love the dark accent wall behind the TV, the painted bureau in the bedroom that plays off the color in the picture above, and small decorative pieces in the bathroom); and the very comfortable bed. Diane was very welcoming but not in the least intrusive. I wasn't expecting to find a gem like this at such a low cost, but am very happy I found Diane's wonderful place. I plan to stay here again and again -- if she isn't already booked, as I believe her place is quite popular!"
19144944,483067949527391303,2021-10-28,119875383,David,Kind and attentive host ☺️
19144944,489113468953683444,2021-11-05,551207,Kathleen,"My second stay was as delightful as the first. This is such a lovely spot, with a great view of the lights of Salem. The rooms are spacious and spotlessly clean. Diane and Tom are wonderful hosts -- helpful but not intrusive. If you need to be in Salem for any reason, this is a great place to stay!"
19144944,491349244615917074,2021-11-08,258067511,Jessica,"Very attentive hosts who make sure you have everything you need but give you your space to relax. The space is exactly as listed. Very comfortable, clean and cozy with everything you need. It’s also super close to great hiking, site seeing and Salem sites. Will definitely stay again if available. Highly recommended!"
19144944,493495614091557545,2021-11-11,3695756,Lisa,"This is an absolute gem in the AirBnB world.  Guests have the whole bottom floor of the house - a HUGE living area, large bedroom and large bathroom (shower, not tub). Everything is very clean and feels well cared for.  As the description indicates, there is no real 'kitchen' - in particular, no sink, and you do not do dishes in the bathroom sink (the house is on septic). BUT, Diane does provide a way to have the basic dishes (glasses, plates, bowls, silverware) washed upstairs.  So heating things in the microwave, or having other foods that don't require a full-on kitchen are fine.  In addition to the incredible comfort, cleanliness and spaciousness of this lodging, the outdoor space is amazing - you have your own patio, with seating and fire pit, and a truly gorgeous view - a hilly oak tree savannah landscape.   It's quiet, peaceful and beautiful.  It's about a 10-15 minute drive to 'downtown' Salem, but there are lots of restaurants, shops etc, even closer.   We had a great stay at Diane's (and Tom's), and would definitely stay again."
19144944,496392972157495841,2021-11-15,21678781,Yvonne,"Wonderful Airbnb property. Nice space, great accommodations and lovely hosts.  And, great value."
19144944,501517746588198485,2021-11-22,187191128,Kathy,"We spent a weekend at Diane's place while visiting our daughter who attends Corban. It was a perfect location for that purpose, right by the campus. We have stayed at various hotels in Salem, and this was so much more convenient and comfortable. The rooms were clean and quiet; the view out the windows onto a garden and wooded area, with a bit of a view of the valley, was beautiful and peaceful. The hosts were very kind and welcoming, and we enjoyed chatting with them, but they also left us alone. There were many hospitable touches such as little muffins, yogurt and juice in the fridge, paper cups by the sink, coffee and cereal available, and a water dispenser that Diane kept filled for us. The kitchenette area consists of a small fridge, microwave, coffee pot, toaster, and a few supplies. There is no kitchen sink or counters, nor freezer to speak of (although I've no doubt Diane would have put something in her freezer for us if we'd asked --- she was very accommodating). An extra table somewhere to provide more ""counter"" space would be helpful. But in general, if you are planning on eating in, keep it simple, with items that don't require a lot of prep or freezer space, and you’ll do great.  All in all, a very nice stay and we will definitely be back!"

The space was pristinely clean and so comfortable. I loved sitting in the cozy chair and looking out the windows over the berry garden and fields and trees. This was just the idyllic retreat I needed to soothe my soul. <3"

I was a little hesitant when I saw it was in the daylight basement of their home, but as soon as I got there I felt so much better. Diane was very welcoming and had everything set up to make you feel right at home. Not to mention you look out the slider to a beautiful country view!  It was an adorable place to stay!"
19144944,653634087023354327,2022-06-20,456713291,Karen,Diane is a wonderful and kind Host. We enjoyed our 2 day stay so muchWe felt so welcomed that we really wished we were staying a little longer. It was so peaceful and quiet in that part of town we felt totally relaxed and happy. I will definitely recommend Diane's AirBNB to all my friends and we hope to return next year.
19144944,658796772941381291,2022-06-27,391121019,Brandi,"Diane was flexible with my late checkout request.  Nice view, but due to the floor level we could hear a lot of floor creaking and water activity from upstairs.  If you don't mind host interaction (like at the door when you arrive to meet and explain the rules, in the living room to get dishes and garbage when you go out to eat, etc.), then it is a nice clean place with a good view and country feel, yet close enough to town to get dinner."
19144944,663167709531962291,2022-07-03,144090894,Alex,"Diane is the most gracious host!  We were treated as guests in her house and felt very welcome. If you're looking for a quiet spot to rest and not be far from downtown, this is it.  Highly recommended!"
19144944,666690676541871434,2022-07-08,1737748,Brian,"We stayed here for four days while visiting family in the Salem area.  We loved the location and the accommodations are spacious and very comfortable.  Diane and Tom are wonderful people, attentive hosts, and we enjoyed meeting them.  We will absolutely try to stay here again in the future!"
19144944,668943800500775103,2022-07-11,406462123,Rick,"Diane and Tom are the epitome of the Perfect Airbnb hosts!  After a week on the road, their place was a peaceful haven to relax, refresh and reboot!  Diane reached out ahead of our arrival to make sure we knew how to get there, where we could park and how to get inside.  Upon our arrival, Diane greeted us to ensure everything was to our liking, ask us if we wanted wood for the outside fire pit and if there was anything she could do to make our stay more comfortable.  She even left some snacks for us and cool water from their well. After that she disappeared, giving us our privacy.  The place is more spacious than it looks in the pictures and it is SUPER clean!  The bed is comfortable, the water pressure in the shower is strong, and the inside and outside are charming.  I HIGHLY recommend staying at the Country Garden Retreat!"
19144944,671767109400748963,2022-07-15,99229230,Nick,"Lovely little garden apartment,  great proximity to Corban University.   Very scenic back yard."

19144944,681277654771304775,2022-07-28,148595520,Stephanie,"My son and I had a wonderful time staying at Diane's house.  She is an amazing host who is kind, helpful and excellent with communication.  The house is in a beautiful location, and it is so relaxing and enjoyable staying there.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a peaceful and comfortable stay in the Salem area."
19144944,682736232568799816,2022-07-30,421007292,Monique,"We only had a 2 night stay but it was super cute & easy to get to. Very spacious. The welcome snacks were most appreciated :D And it was a GREAT value!!! Diane came down daily to empty out the dirty dishes & garbage for us, and refill the most delicious well water... while we were out. You MUST drink the water lol All the basics were there. Mini fridge & microwave... toaster & coffee pot (with coffee!!). Overall, very good stay while visiting Salem!"
19144944,684085585063902727,2022-08-01,440581208,Susan,"Beautiful location, home and hosts."

Will most definitely consider staying again next time I visit Salem!
19144944,688489174012030867,2022-08-07,164670064,Jen,Diane is a lovely host. Her home is very clean. The living room was very spacious and had a great view. The location has a quiet country feel but only a 10 min drive to get food/coffee.

19144944,700774996418805949,2022-08-24,4381558,Robin,This is a great piece of country in the city. The area is spacious and Diane offers an enormous amount of energy to keep her guests happy. A great place to stay when you are in the area either for work or vacation.
19144944,705816984038789354,2022-08-31,463874080,Tawnya,My guest was accosted and asked if she was a drug addict two days into the stay if you want to stay at a place where people question everything about you then this is the place for you I hated this day I left after two days. That’s my feeling on this host
19144944,710266443856589646,2022-09-06,63629099,Linda,My stay at Diane’s was very relaxing.  I found their home very clean and nothing lacking.

19144944,717481075651880794,2022-09-16,162600206,Victoria,"Very private entrance, clean room, comfortable bed and loved the snacks available in the room. Every AirBnB should have snacks and a small selection of food to go! Would stay again if I needed to."
19144944,719619927027198816,2022-09-19,472373538,Kristin,"Our hosts were incredibly thoughtful and welcoming. Very kind and genuine people. We felt especially safe here, and the location is quite charming and quiet, but with easy access into town if you need to pick anything up or grab food. Check-in was easy and communication timely and helpful. The space was much larger than we had anticipated and very comfortable and ""homey."" The accommodations were comfortable, and our hosts were even extra thoughtful by turning a lamp on in the space for us before we came home in the evening after it was dark. <br/><br/>Bonus perk: My hair was softer after washing it in the shower there than it has been in years with our over-treated, extra-hard water back at home. I didn't even know my hair was capable of being that soft and shiny. It was a nice vacation for my hair as well as the rest me."
19144944,724729109913811074,2022-09-26,6734343,Jean,This was the perfect place for us. Absolutely everything was five star. We have been recommending it to friends as well. Super value!!! We will definitely stay here whenever we visit the area.

19144944,740683301301614723,2022-10-18,442783149,Laurel,I stayed here during a family reunion in nearby Turner.  It says it all that it didn’t take long before I was referring to this place as my Zen Den.  Diane and Tom are wonderful hosts.
19144944,749386891380304878,2022-10-30,63051764,John,"They have earned all the great reviews: nice accommodations, spacious & clean. A very hospitable couple, offering to help as requested, but otherwise leaving renter’s alone."

19144944,785622919529660337,2022-12-19,187191128,Kathy,"We are return customers! We first chose Diane's place because of the proximity to Corban University, where we have a student. We found it to be clean, quiet, and comfortable. The hosts are very friendly and responsive to questions. It is ideal for a couple; a third person can stay on an airbed they have. There is not an actual kitchen, but it has a microwave, coffee pot, toaster, and small fridge. Not really set up for lots of meal prep, but we were able to toast bagels, reheat food, etc. Being right next to the college makes it so easy for us to stay there, and I'm sure we will be back!"
19144944,812468000413203399,2023-01-25,87313539,Jaime,My only regret is that I wish I had more time to truly enjoy Diane’s home. It was very spacious and comfortable and she adds little details that make you feel at home. I would definitely stay here again.
19144944,815392539457844310,2023-01-29,187191128,Kathy,"We have stayed at Diane's place several times visiting our daughter. We keep coming back because it works so well for us. It is clean and comfortable, on a quiet street right by Corban University and only a few minutes from stores and restaurants. We appreciate the little homey touches like juice and yogurt in the fridge, and the hosts are always very welcoming."

It was comfy, well appointed, and filled with anything we might need.  But truly, it was the hospitality of Tom and Diane that made it feel like coming home.  We're looking forward to staying again. 😊"

I love the private bathroom, separate entrance and the thoughtful amenities -- coffee pot, microwave, mini fridge and use of washer & dryer.  Oh, did I mentioned that there is also a sauna that can be used???  Lovely backyard with shared grill.  Convenient to so many things -- located near Commercial Street in southern portion of Salem.  Host is friendly, helpful, polite and extra thoughtful."
19388806,172393655,2017-07-20,115010064,Mike,"My wife and I had a great stay at Cindy's place!  The location is great.  Close to downtown, but also close to family we visit.  The place itself is wonderfully decorated and inviting.  We were able to relax in the evening in the ""living room"" area, then settle into a pleasant sleep after. If you visit Salem, I would highly recommend a stay with Cindy!"

Cindy's place was a very welcome respite from moving and staying with family. We loved the central location for getting around town. The room beautifully decorated, the bed was very comfortable and the shower had great water pressure. Cindy really goes the extra step to make the space very relaxing and to make sure her guests are well taken care of. Thanks so much!"

19388806,185460731,2017-08-21,115742843,Cameran,"Fast communication, and a very cute complete suite in Salem, Oregon. There is the added benefit of a sauna, which we had a chance to enjoy.  This experience is the prime example of why we love Airbnb.  We like to have something different then the cookie cutter hotel room.  How great to have had a chance to sauna in our room."

From the  decor, to the soft towels, to the breakfast items. There were umbrellas next to the door and a box of tissues in the bathroom. Cindy's thoughtfulness and attention to detail really shows! <br/>The studio-like room is located in a quiet neighborhood, yet only a couple blocks from a main road, Commercial Street. We had a car rental, but ended up exploring on foot for a whole day. It takes less than 30 minutes​ to walk downtown."

Sauna before bed was fabulous extra. Cindy's 'nook' is private 'studio apt' like. Private secure entrance. Living room, w/ sofa, coffee table, oh, and fireplace by remote control. After rainy days in Salem, a welcome comfort. Secure parking in the backyard. Nice yard too. Stayed four nights. There is a washer/dryer right there too. So for longer stays, this is the nook. Why would I stay anywhere else?  Highly recommend ."

It's a place to sit down on the couch with your feet up, fire up the gas logs, and read, watch cable TV, or listen to music.<br/><br/>The furnishings are very attractive and tastefully arranged.  The bed was comfortable and the noise level was very low.  The kitchen area included a mini frig, microwave, and coffee maker.  A washer and dryer were available, and the spray from the bathroom shower was hot and quite strong - it felt wonderful.  There's also a sauna, which we didn't try.<br/><br/>Everything at Cindy's was sparkling clean and worked as advertised.  Her description of the suite was one hundred percent accurate.  It was comfortable, quiet, and looked great.  We would stay there again in a heartbeat."

19388806,251294366,2018-04-07,122438968,Cindy,"Wonderful space to be in, plenty of room for working and for yoga. Coffee and fireplace in the morning were delightful. I would love to come back."
19388806,253195639,2018-04-13,2163799,Sean,This was my third stay at Cindy's place. I hope to stay again. Her place is so peaceful and comfortable.
19388806,253499008,2018-04-14,178348067,Rodney,We felt right at home and could have stayed inside or enjoyed the deck had we not made other plans. Very relaxing!
19388806,258187807,2018-04-28,28354305,Mary,Cindy’s place is a great place to stay! It’s close to downtown Salem. Her space is very cozy and she has thought of every detail. The Sauna is perfect for a long day of wine tasting! <br/>If we come though here again we will definitely stay here again!
19388806,262994896,2018-05-10,54656611,Rachelle,"Cindy's place is very nicely put together, with lovely decorating and feminine touches.  She's thought of all the amenities, with a luggage rack, snack center and a small breakfast.  The sauna is an indulgent touch, and really fun to use!  For us, the only downside was the bed; it was nice and firm but for some reason didn't agree with our backs.  But otherwise, it was a perfect stay!"
19388806,266259295,2018-05-19,189418984,Mary,"Everything Cindy describes about her nook is true.  Very nicely appointed, good snacks, sauna is big enough to spread out and the place is quiet.  I got a good night's rest.  I enjoyed lounging on the couch in front of the fire."
19388806,266889051,2018-05-20,85323076,Crystal,What a nice relaxing space. It's so clean and well put together. Cindy obviously pays attention to the details. We found Cindy's place was exactly as advertised. You will not be disappointed.

19388806,273059249,2018-06-04,13997025,Michael,"Cindy's ""nook"" was a wonderful place for us. So many nice touches and though we didn't take advantage of the sauna or fireplace,  we could see that in cooler weather (we were there in June) both would be very welcome. We could tell that Cindy takes great pride in making her guests feel important. We would stay with Cindy again!"
19388806,274621053,2018-06-09,33783474,Eddie,"Cindy's place was great - affordable, clean, large. Cindy quickly responded to my messages, and check-in was a breeze. Highly recommend. "

19388806,309114528,2018-08-17,5349392,Amanda,We stopped at Cindy’s place for one night and it was everything we needed and more. We would have been happy to stay there longer if our travel plans permitted it. Very clean and private space. 
19388806,310650184,2018-08-19,21007267,Steven,"I wish we had more time to spend in Salem, this was such a cozy place in a quiet and convenient location. But we just needed a place to spend the night after a day at a wedding and reception. We checked in late and left early to head back over the mountains so we never had a chance to meet our host.<br/>It was very neat and tidy it was nice to have off street parking.<br/>If we ever have reason to come back to Salem for a couple of days Cindy's place would be at the top of our list of places to stay. "
19388806,312553812,2018-08-23,2209078,Kelley,"Cindy's place was roomy, cozy, clean. We loved making use of a picnic table and table and chairs on the deck overlooking the beautifully landscaped yard. Cindy was gracious, just popped in for a braief chat and left us to our lounging! Her place is well appointed, plenty of room for me and my grown daughter to enjoy our time together. Loved the nearby natural foods store, Life Source I think it's called; Cafe Yum (Yum!) and the French Press for coffee, baked goods and breakfast. And there was a homemade chocolate zucchini muffin for each of us in the fridge! Nice touches all around. My daughter used the sauna - said it got really toasty, she didn't last long, but a nice treat. "

19388806,315422015,2018-08-28,2109348,Dana,"Cindy has done a nice job with her daylight basement. After I found all the amenities, I realized how she creatively used that space in her home for guests. Entering through the garage worried me until I opened the door to her bright and cheery place. "

Almost every guest need has been  anticipated and provided.  The layout, furnishing and ambiance of the Nook has been carefully thought through and executed for maximum ease and comfort."
19388806,328255355,2018-09-25,216740508,Michael,"What a super place to stay.  Perfectly located for walking to health food market LIFE SOURSE, and to Panera Bread. Cindy's suggestion to visit a local cafe ACME ended up as a real treat. Also - Great walking in the hills through the neighborhoods. Cindy is a great host - very responsive - yet left us to our quiet time relaxing in the nook. Having the gas fireplace was a wonderful amenity for early morning or late evening warm up and to just snuggle near on the sooo comfortable sofa."
19388806,332188321,2018-10-04,79735649,Mike,A great place with a great host.

19388806,344496968,2018-11-03,4924891,Charles,"This is listed as a private room, but it's basically your own house.  There's a private entrance through the garage, then you have an open bedroom/livingroom area, bathroom, and a  laundry, kitchen, sauna area.  You just don't have an  oven.  If you're okay with eating out or cooking in a microwave, then this would be a great place to stay for a week or more. So much better than a hotel, for less money."

19388806,363457471,2018-12-28,173688723,Emily,"Cindy’s place is like your very own cozy little basement apartment. The fireplace warms the whole space, there’s a sweet little kitchenette with a washer and dryer, AND a sauna! Best AirBnB ever, in my opinion. You can hear noises from upstairs, but I slept right through them so, unless you’re a really light sleeper it’s no problem. You’ll be glad to call it home for a couple nights."

19388806,404349414,2019-01-23,57820866,Jeanne,"What a lovely relaxing private space. Airbnb'ers who want a little personal space will appreciate the separate entrance and plenty of room. I especially loved the gas fireplace on a cold night! Yes, early on in the evening I could hear a little activity from up above but it wasn't an issue - just what sounded like someone making dinner then nothing; I slept like a baby! Wish I'd had time to use the sauna - wow!"
19388806,405768214,2019-01-27,21024127,Randi,"Great space! Warm feel, spacious, quiet, clean, and comfortable. The sauna was amazing! Location was within walking distance to the workshop I was in town for. I enjoyed  a nice walk through the neighborhood to/from the workshop, had lunch on the back patio during my breaks on the sunny days, and relaxed by the fireplace in the private room each evening. It was a nice respite and I felt right at home for a few days! I would definitely stay here again."

Thank You so much.<br/><br/>I did take a picture of the snow at about 2 to 3 inches in the morning and I guess I did not send the pick as It did not apear in the text message.   oops.<br/><br/>If I have forgotten any thing just ""sell it and send the money"" truly did love the space.<br/><br/>Thom"

I was stopping through town on business and she responded quickly and made sure I was able to access the unit without issue. The sauna was awesome and the fireplace kept me plenty warm on a cold night. This was my first time using Airbnb for a private room in someone’s home and I must say Cindy exceeded my expectations.

19388806,734588078,2021-02-26,311048883,Jessica,"For this place being my first Airbnb experience I couldn't be more pleased. The rentals atmosphere is very welcoming. Like your staying at a relatives house you haven't been to in a while. THE SAUNA WAS THE BEST!!! It was so relaxing to get the sauna treatment and enjoy our very clean, comfortable space."
19388806,736762885,2021-03-06,253007497,Jody,Cindy’s place is my favorite stopping place any time my travels bring me through the Salem area. Nice and private and a good value.

19388806,741995645,2021-03-24,183343406,Kaitlyn,Cindy’s place is wonderful! The backyard is very nice and relaxing. The neighborhood is very cute and seemed really safe. The sauna was great after a long drive. The bed was comfortable as was the couch which was also very nice after a long drive. The only thing that could have been better was the internet as I was on a business trip and needed a bit more speed for work stuff. However it definitely wasn’t a deal breaker and is still five stars! I will definitely be back if/when I return to Salem.
19388806,742475885,2021-03-26,341670621,Nguyen,Nice stay! I had a good time at this place! Very clean! Cindy was also really hospitality

19388806,759741024,2021-05-17,79535159,Betsy,"Cindy's Nook is a lovely place to stay in Salem. It has a welcoming feel, right down to the motion sensor lights at entrances so we didn't have to be fumbling for switches and the yogurt & granola in the mini-fridge. Being able to do laundry was a bonus. Comfortable, clean, and convenient; excellent communication.  The yard was especially gorgeous in mid-May, and the back deck is a wonderful place to relax."
19388806,761102336,2021-05-22,147560921,Patrick,"Highly recommend Cindy’s place. ....   Impeccably clean, well appointed  and  super comfortable."

19388806,639867031486233567,2022-06-01,3575870,Karen,"Comfy bed and good shower. That's really all I had time to do is sleep and shower, traveling for work. Intended to use the sauna but I just crashed. Lovely back yard gardens and deck. It IS a garage apartment, with a car parked outside the apt. door, so if you desire swanky, this isn't that, but it's nicely decorated, clean, very comfortable, no perfuming air freshners (which I very much appreciate), secure and I'd stay again."
19388806,642079435689338714,2022-06-04,36839860,Coty,"Cindy was great! Very easy to communicate with and very quick to respond. Her place was easy to find, very clean and cozy and a perfect place to relax after a long drive!"

19488223,815342847886495794,2023-01-29,17493587,Karisa,"Greg was an amazing host. He was responsive and friendly. He was also very flexible when we needed to add a few more guests and a pet. The location of the house is within blocks of Willamette University and downtown, but is in a quiet and cute residential district. We appreciated so many extra beds, as well! We would definitely book again!"

19488223,833441466467608089,2023-02-23,404336244,Leslie,"Greg’s place was very cozy. I am a healthcare worker and commute one hour to salem for work We stayed one night Because of the snow storm we needed to get into salem asap before it got bad. Greg was able to open up his place for us last minute literally an hour before we needed it. And accommodating of check out time, he was very responsive and helpful and made sure we had what we needed. Definitely recommend for families or just anyone! Thank you so much."
19488223,835694200174191208,2023-02-26,52878793,Melody,"This was a quaint duplex. It was nice having a fenced backyard for our dog and some breakfast fixings for the morning. Since it is an older house there were limited outlets in the bedrooms, the fixtures were worn out and it was really hard to know how to work the heaters. It was really close to the gym for the volleyball tournament and local eateries. Overall it was a good stay."
19488223,845107475721686796,2023-03-11,478010573,Susan,Greg was super responsive and very helpful in allowing us to make some changes to our departure time.  Would definitely stay here again.
19488223,846424081291640094,2023-03-13,13416377,Rachel,"A very sizeable space with lots of spots to sleep! They include extra homey amenities, including pancake mix, coffee, other pantry items, and games (Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots!) that we took advantage of. The host let us check in a little early and we were thrilled to have an Airbnb that our dog could enjoy."
19488223,850767610290448056,2023-03-19,286411266,Katie,Very fun and colorful place. Loved the amount of sleeping spaces too.

19488223,855845491616293047,2023-03-26,402120918,Khettery,Communicated to make sure when we’d check in. Very descriptive about place. It’s roomy and quiet for a place to stay for a weekend. Which we only needed to sleep for
19532562,185522782,2017-08-21,146654366,Eric,The house is a charming 1910 cottage with many delightful authentic architectural features on a lovely tree lined street in a historic neighborhood within walking distance of downtown Salem.  Our Hosts were very accommodating and had provided everything we could have needed.  We had a wonderful time.
19840044,179907893,2017-08-08,6546444,Sarah-Ray,This place was so cute. Everything looked like it had just been redone and it felt really clean. My favorite part was probably how comfortable the bed was considering we were mostly there to sleep. There were even chocolates on the pillows when we got there! It was nice there were a few small snacks we could eat in the morning to get us going before we were able to make it out the door for breakfast. Thank you for a peaceful place to relax while in Salem!
19840044,180222728,2017-08-09,64104151,Marcia,"Needing a heatwave break, I booked a place with central air close to home. Wow, what a find! If you are looking for lodging in Salem, you cannot do better than Sunnyslope Retreat. Surprisingly spacious with clean, crisp decor. It was quiet, restful and I loved the private entrance that didn’t require engaging with the homeowners after a tiring day. I travel frequently for work and this place is perfect for business travelers as it made me feel at ease and at home. If the need arises, I will definitely stay here again."
19840044,180984788,2017-08-11,144315319,Steve,"Chuck & Lorie Neighbors are  polite, professional and friendly. Whether you are spending one night or a week they will treat you like, well, like good neighbors! You will find everything that you need right at hand. I especially liked all the appliances for making meals and they even have an available crockpot! The sleep number bed was heaven and the gas fireplace was a wonderful surprise! I'll book with them again for certain and recommend you do too!"
19840044,185518716,2017-08-21,133860984,Arline,Salem is beautiful and our hosts Lorie & Chuck were warm and welcoming.  They even set up a pack and play for our Baby McKenzie.  Highly recommend the Sunnyslope retreat!
19840044,187859167,2017-08-27,121072775,Judith,"Chuck and Lorie are lovely folks and have a really nice private unit facing the back-yard of their home in Salem.  I was visiting Willamette University where my daughter attends school so it was important to be somewhat close to the capitol area.  Their apartment has a totally private entry (well lit at night) and the apartment is incredibly spacious, consisting of a bedroom, living room and a bath room.  There is an area set aside for preparing food, and a dining table too, all located in the huge living room area.  The apartment is well insulated and during my two night stay,  I heard nary a noise from their house above (where they reside).  The bed was very comfortable with adjustable mattress firming controls and the bedroom is spacious and quiet.  They provided everything you would need if you forgot something (toothpaste, soap, hair products, and even included a number of food items in the kitchen area.  WiFi hook up was effortless and connection speed was fast.  It is conveniently located in a wonderful neighborhood with easy parking I was able to get to Willamette University within 10 minutes of leaving the house.  All in all, it is a wonderful spot in Salem and I will be returning in the future.  Highly recommended!!"
19840044,190624679,2017-09-04,37711090,Joost,Great place which lies in a very quiet and peaceful neighborhood of Salem. You have the entire lower floor to yourself which is very spacious. Additionally there is a large garden to enjoy. Chuck and Lorie really make sure their guests are comfortable and have everything they need.

19840044,212640614,2017-11-18,34006096,Tracy,I had a great time at Chuck and Lorie's place. It was everything I needed while visiting family in the area. Chuck was there to meet me for check-in and show me around the place and they were both great with communication during my stay. My favorite part of the house was the fireplace! It kept me warm while winding down my nights. I look forward to a stay again in the future.
19840044,215126585,2017-11-27,26247747,Vivian,"Lorie and Chuck have done a fantastic job of making their apartment cute and comfortable.  The decor is both tasteful and functional, the queen bed and linens are a dream and the written instructions are     <br/>all-encompassing.  With our busy family gathering schedule we had little opportunity to shop so we greatly appreciated the coffee, fruit, yummy snacks and stocked mini fridge.  With a coded private entry door we could come and go at our leisure but our hosts were always available by email and quick to respond to any needs."
19840044,221512166,2017-12-26,158322997,Deana,"Quiet location. Private accommodation with separate entry. The space is very comfortable and generous. Meticulously clean and appointed.

Personally very welcoming and then respectful of my privacy. The space was exactly as described with way too many useful and very thoughtful touches and additions to list — a very quiet, welcoming, and immaculately clean home away from home. I will definitely be staying here on my next stop through Salem."

They were quick to respond, and amenable to our later arrival. <br/><br/>The space was nicely situated in a beautiful backyard garden. Plenty of light and space to spread out.  The apartment was very clean, nicely decorated, with luxurious towels, and good coffee! We enjoyed our stay very much and felt well taken care of by Chuck and Lorie. They even texted to check up on us and ask if there was anything we needed. <br/>The special touches like the lending library, chocolates and ear plugs on the bedside, and the umbrella by the door were very thoughtful. <br/><br/>I will definitely stay here again ‘<br/>B.

19840044,347084947,2018-11-10,29515974,Michelle,Chuck and Lorie’s place is cozy and was perfect for my business trip.  I slept well on the sleep number bed and enjoyed the snacks and beverages that were provided.  Chuck met me when I arrived and accommodated my need for an early check in.  He showed me everything i needed to know and was very kind.<br/>I would love to stay again if my work brings me back to Salem.
19840044,356571812,2018-12-08,130083237,Joel,This is my favorite place to stay in Salem (and i've stayed in a few).  I come to Salem 4 or 5 times a year and this is a great place to stay especially if you need to work while you're there.  They have a nice work space setup in the bedroom with plenty of desk space and a comfortable chair.  Plenty of space to relax as well.  Wifi access works well also.  <br/><br/>I'll be back.
19840044,358537394,2018-12-14,23299692,Sara,"Very quiet and private. Super clean. Chuck and Lorie provided so many extras! Coffee, snacks, breakfast... I'll stay here again when I'm in salem. It really was perfect for my needs."

19840044,367424490,2019-01-04,19378483,Diane,Chuck and Lorie are wonder considerate hosts. They provide everything necessary for out of town guests to be comfortable  more. The appartment is so clean and very comfortable. They are attentive and ready to help. We will definitely stay again while visiting our son.

Chuck and Lorie are the most thoughtful, gracious hosts.<br/><br/>They provided us with all the information we needed and showed us around. The flat is just perfect! The place is compact and contains everything one needs.<br/><br/>The bed is comfortable, bathroom and terrace and garden are excellent. Fireplace is beautiful and cozy.

19840044,460254811,2019-05-28,235789699,Marjorie,"Chuck and Lori seem to have thought of everything we could possibly need;  far beyond anything we anticipated.  A wonderful rest on a Sleep Number bed, a comfy rocker in front of a fire place (gas), plush white towels in the bathroom, a great local Pinot Noir wine waiting with fine cheese  for us after a long day's of travel. Roku movies to entertain us, no- key to- lose coded entry and all very private.  Loved it!!"
19840044,463690790,2019-06-03,57822653,Eric,"Exquisite accomodation  in a serene setting in a peaceful neighborhood. Top of the tier service, cheery setting & decorum , & comfortable furnishings  in a spacious living space with lots of natural light, made for a  sublime experience...and to top off the superlatives...  hosts, Chuck & Lorie, were genuine in their efforts to make me feel welcome in ""Hyatt Regency Club"" member fashion !"
19840044,471618570,2019-06-17,69671433,Evelyn,Great space. Very welcoming. We really enjoyed our stay there. I would recommend it.  We went wine tasting and were able to get there with no trouble.
19840044,477682733,2019-06-28,268136008,Rhonda,My stay was wonderful. The touches that Chuck and Lorie have at their space are so inviting and make the stay so much more appealing than a hotel. I loved having the suggestions for the surrounding area as my son and his family just moved here 6 months ago and still are getting acquainted with the area so we were all able to benefit. Thanks so much for having me. Truly a great first air bnb experience!!
19840044,483743758,2019-07-07,56138237,Diana,One of the best Airbnb experiences I've ever had. Chuck and Lorie were extremely thoughtful in what they put into the space. We had everything we needed (and more) for a weekend stay. They were very friendly and accommodating.
19840044,492983871,2019-07-21,10659723,Tricia,"Chuck & Lorie are fantastic hosts! They were communicative and friendly, welcoming us to their home (despite our late arrival) and ensuring we had everything we needed for an enjoyable stay. The place was sparkling clean and comfortable, with a view into their beautiful back yard, and full of extra special touches to make us feel at home -- wine, snacks, breakfast, coffee/tea, chocolates, dinner recommendations, activity ideas, etc. I highly recommend staying here, you will love it!!"
19840044,503911674,2019-08-06,148316197,Dipak,Very clean &  nicely decorated apartment with a helpful owner.
19840044,510919773,2019-08-16,118206904,Nathan,"I should say something horrible to hide this GEM!   They elevated the standard to hospitality to an absurd level.   Wine, cheese, yogurt, instructions, guides, personal engagement.  Felt like a lost but returning nephew.   Stay here only if you want all other stays to fall short of your new expectations"
19840044,515273715,2019-08-22,285010158,Kathy,"I was pleasantly surprised by all the little extras and surprises in every corner. Lorie and Chuck made my time away from home feel like home. Loved the pretzels, Chuck!"
19840044,516731682,2019-08-24,268443229,Sabina Brady,This was a lovely stay - first time using AirBnB and I was not sure how that would go. This was a wonderful first experience with it and would highly recommend this location for anyone making trips whether business or pleasure!
19840044,526410969,2019-09-08,190205699,Logan,Staying with Chuck and Lorie will give you more of a at home with family experience and is a amazing comforting place instead of just some place to sleep at night.
19840044,528757450,2019-09-13,285010158,Kathy,"I spent about 1 month there, and it is more than one could ask for."
19840044,539124057,2019-09-30,85371326,Dede,We had a great stay!  We were in Salem visiting our son who attends Willamette University & stumbled across Chuck & Lorie’s place at the last minute. Very pleased with everything. We were very tired when we first arrived after traveling & were bummed that we didn’t get a chance to pick up a bottle of wine to unwind before we went to bed. We were pleasantly surprised to find wine and snacks greeting us on our arrival.  Really a great place we will be back.
19840044,544685837,2019-10-10,15587980,Jessye,Absolutely loved staying here! Chuck and Lorie are wonderful people. Their space is immaculately clean and the bed is extremely comfortable! Those are our 2 top priorities when staying in an Airbnb and Chuck and Lorie nailed it. We also loved all the extra time and thought they have put into this rental. You can tell they are passionate about hospitality.
19840044,546489937,2019-10-13,121072775,Judith,"Our second stay at Chuck and Lorie's and we were not disappointed.  Is a wonderfully comfortable and roomy spot, perfect for a visit to Willamette University.  Location is a bit away from the downtown area but close to everything you could need or want and only 5 minutes away from campus.  Will definitely come again!"

We enjoy the peace and quiet of the residential location and yet it is very convenient to all of Salem.  The unit is very spacious compared to most airbnbs and we enjoy being able to spread out a bit.  This time we enjoyed the warmth and coziness of the gas fireplace in the evening.  We would definitely stay here again.
19840044,572706043,2019-12-03,130083237,Joel,"We have stayed here over 5 times.  We always want to return.  The space is clean, comfortable and has great amenities.   We would recommend this to anyone visiting Salem ❤️"

Their place is so clean and cozy and the sleep number bed is amazingly comfortable. There is room to stretch out and the fireplace is such a nice treat on a chilly Oregon night.  The neighborhood is  peaceful, quiet, friendly and walkable.  Plus their place is walking distance to groceries and a yummy teriyaki joint!  We will be staying here again!"

However, they do provide a mini fridge, microwave, coffee pot, dishes, and even a crock pot. The bathroom had everything I needed including shampoo, conditioner, and a good blow dryer.  The gas fireplace in the living room was easy to operate and very relaxing in the cool evenings with a book and a glass of wine. (They provide snacks and a lovely bottle of wine.) During the afternoon we were visited by a family of deer, visible through the large picture window in the living room. I appreciated how clean the place was as well as they very detailed and easy to follow instructions for everything. Street parking was easy, and the location is about 10 minutes from downtown Salem by car. I visit Salem a few times a  year in will definitely be looking them up again."

We had the pleasure of meeting both Chuck and Lorie. What blew me away are the thoughtful, personal touches they made which included but were not limited to: chocolates by each bed side table, incredibly thorough instructions on how to use every device in the house, coffee, yogurt, oatmeal, teas, fresh fruit, individual packs of makeup remover, cheeses, a delightful bottle of Oregon pinot noir! The list goes on and on. The location was perfect and right in the heart of South Salem, which means that it was close to everything you could need in Salem. The unit appears to be brand new and is in immaculate condition with big windows that let you see a beautiful, green back yard, or you can sit and read a book and cozy up in front of a gas fireplace to stay toasty. Best place I've stayed in Salem and will look to book again on my next visit. 5/5 outstanding hosts and home."

This is a very comfortable apartment with plenty of room with extra personal touches by the owners from snacks to being greeted with a bottle of wine next to a wine opener and wine glass. I loved coming home each evening and using the gas fireplace after dinner while having some wine. The fact that there was not a full kitchen was not a problem as I ordered out. There is a crockpot and microwave for those who would like to cook and full dinnerware, coffee pot, and a small fridge available. I have already reserved this place again for my next return to Salem."

If I say all the great things about this place, it’s more likely to be booked the em next time I am in town. :/<br/><br/>Clean, private, and added touches that set it apart in Salem. Chuck and Lorie host the way they would like to be hosted.

It is stylishly decorated, beautifully located for our wine tasting activities, and they have an awesome book of recommended activities that are spot on.  Having spent 11 years living in Salem, I’ll just add two more restaurants to their suggestions:  Tup Tim for Thai food and Los Baez for the best Mexican food in town.<br/><br/>While the retreat doesn’t have a hot plate, there is a crock pot and microwave with full dish ware and Lorie provides yogurt, oatmeal, fruit, and various snacks.  We brought along hard-boiled eggs and didn’t miss having a hot plate at all.<br/><br/>The bed is a Sleep number bed.  My husband and I just discovered after 20 years that apparently we like vastly different numbers of comfort!  LOL!  We both had a great night’s sleep both nights of our stay.<br/><br/>We highly recommend this place!"

The space was exactly as described and shown in the pictures. The work space was the best I have had at any of my stays, so much room for everything I needed to do. The special touches that they do and put into the space really make this a great location for your trip to Salem! Highly recommend and will definitely stay again."

While there is no kitchen (and that is clearly explained in the description), Lorie and Chuck have thought of every detail to accommodate that: coffee pot, toaster, crock pot, electric kettle, microwave, mini refrigerator and freezer, etc. The bed is so comfortable. The living is spacious.  There is a spacious desk in the bedroom (which we needed while we stayed there to remote into to work). Lorie and Chuck greeted us when we arrived and said goodbye as we were leaving.  They gave excellent recommendations of local places to eat. They are top notch hosts! <br/>We’re looking forward to our next stay here when we come back to Salem!"

19840044,435580405966042789,2021-08-23,7954306,Donna,"Chuck & Lorie are obviously seasoned travelers themselves since they've thought of everything a guest might possibly want or need and made it available in their spotless apartment. Brimming with thoughtful touches, their cozy place is the perfect retreat for visitors to Salem who appreciate a quiet refuge after a busy day of sightseeing and/or visiting family and friends. We greatly appreciated not only the pleasant space but also the heartfelt welcome that Chuck & Lorie gave us and would definitely return to their lovely home."

19840044,479684039633146114,2021-10-23,26502545,Megan,"This place is immaculate! And the location is private and beautiful. This is a daylight walk out basement which means that host, and guest, noises do travel through the ceiling and the vents. It is background noise and we only mention this in the review in case it might be bothersome to someone considering this lovely Airbnb. The hosts went above and beyond with thoughtful supplies and everything was in excellent condition. The detailed written instructions were very helpful."
19840044,482697828599789722,2021-10-27,10975035,Bethany,"Chuck and Lori were great! Very friendly and welcoming, and they left snacks wine and coffee for us! The guest suite has its own separate entrance with a smart lock (SO nice not having to keep track of keys!) and feels very private. We also rarely could hear anything going on upstairs (and normally in a basement suite you hear everything going on above!). We would definitely stay here again."

19840044,523995757236403483,2021-12-23,211410159,Lisa,Perfect Airbnb place. I have stayed here at least a few times already and always look for it when I need to be in Salem for work travel. It’s so warm and inviting and very clean.  There’s so much TLC in this place and the fireplace is the frosting on the cake for those cold winter wet nights in Salem.

The hosts were extremely sweet and attentive. The welcome bottle of wine and basket of healthy snacks were a nice touch and much appreciated because we were so busy running around town all day. And, it was sooo nice to return a super quiet and clean neighborhood. The sleep number bed had us so spoiled. Now we need one for our home. Will definitely ask to come back. Thank you C & L!!!"
19840044,557317871039842001,2022-02-07,163843937,Doyce,"Chuck & Lorie welcome their guests to one of the cleanest and best decorated air b&b's in the Salem area.  This property is quiet, clean and handy to downtown and groceries.  Comfortable bed, awesome fireplace and handy adequate parking."

19840044,571826302358384407,2022-02-27,431428150,Steve,"Chuck & Lorie are wonderful hosts!  I can't emphasize that enough.  Really nice people who really care about their guests having a comfortable, happy stay.  Their apartment is perfect for one person or a couple for either a short visit or medium length visit.  I was moving here for work and so needed a place where I could comfortably work and live while I moved into my new place.  Sunnyslope retreat was perfect.  It is very conveniently located to shopping, restaurants, and less than 10 minutes to downtown even during rush hour.  Everything worked perfectly including excellent wifi service and lots of outlets to charge phones and computers and a great work space with an excellent desk space and work chair. Their were  also nice touches like fruit and snacks and some refreshments in the fridge as well as nice bottle of pinot.  All in all I highly recommend Chuck & Lorie's Sunnyslope retreat to anyone in need of a comfortable place to stay in the Salem area at a very reasonable rate."
19840044,574699787343665121,2022-03-03,186669362,Sasha,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Sunnyslope retreat. It’s quiet and comfortable. Chuck and Lorie are great hosts and from what we can tell beautiful humans. <br/>The apartment is well furnished and decorated. Every detail feels thoughtful. <br/>From the sleep number bed to the toiletries and snacks. <br/>The apartment is clean, smells good and feels safe. <br/>We had such a nice stay and even got to see a deer come through the backyard. <br/>We will stay here again given the chance and recommend Sunnyslope to all our friends and family who come to visit Oregon."
19840044,591376592326390446,2022-03-26,301553424,Kristy,"A nice, comfortable space located on the bottom floor of the hosts house. There is a short walk down a side driveway and around back to get into the entrance. The property is located in a clean and quiet neighborhood, and the space looks out on a peaceful backyard. <br/><br/>We had a decent stay with only minor issues. Multiple times upon entering the space we had to air it out due to a rather unpleasant smell. Using the fireplace was a little unnerving as it pops on rather strongly as you have to light it by hand and it did take some time to heat the space up. We did appreciate the multiple ceiling fans to help with air circulation. The kitchenette space and fridge were smaller than we had expected so we could only prepare small meals and snacks and ended up having to eat out more than we had planned. The water in the bathroom does take a bit of time to heat up for a shower and in the sink. And the bed has a number mattress which took quite a bit of time to adjust because the remotes were hard to operate. Space was clean and nicely furnished, and we enjoyed an evening of playing board games that were available for use."

The bottle of wine and basket of snacks was such a nice touch and made for a great relaxing evening.<br/><br/>The space is so clean, so well thought out, and absolutely 5 stars.<br/>The bed was very comfortable, we slept freakin good... And each morning we opened the blinds hoping we would see a little deer in the beautiful backyard. ♥️<br/>If this is available, BOOK IT.<br/>It’s a gem, and they are amazing hosts.<br/>We truly appreciated them opening their home to us. What an AMAZING Airbnb!"

The tiny little details made this stay a little more special. Our favorite thing to use was the fireplace, it warmed up the place nicely. Their hospitality, kindness, and understanding does not go unnoticed. We highly recommend this place and will definitely rent it again in the future if there are available openings!"

They were very attentive with very clear instructions. ""Apartment"" was attractively decorated & loaded with so many unexpected and thoughtful extras (snacks, breakfast items, chocolate, cheese & wine) for our enjoyment and comfort.

19983672,185850926,2017-08-22,143379958,Shari,"We were so fortunate to have booked Megan's home to be in Salem for the great eclipse! She lives in a quiet community and has a very lovely home. Her past experience as the owner of a bed and breakfast is evident in her extraordinary attention to detail, ensuring that her guests are settled in and comfortable. She made sure we had breakfast supplies and snacks, which was so kind of her to do. We were able to watch the eclipse in the meadow like field about 100 yards from her home, and even picked fresh blackberries from the brambles there. Another treat was to sit on her enclosed front patio, enjoying a glass of wine and all the stars above. If you are looking for a peaceful retreat while you explore the Salem area, this is the place to stay."

Huge public park backs up to the property, which is quite inviting.  Also, there are huge trees on and around her property which provide natural shade and air conditioning.  Having been a local for 20+ years, she knows the area very well, and can offer tips and guidance for what to do and see in the greater Salem area."

The room is very spacious, as is the bathroom, and lots of closet room. Recently remodeled: everything new.  And the entire front half of the house is included in the booking: family room, living room.  Private entrance through the front door, bedroom directly to the right.  Only the kitchen/laundry room is ""Shared"" space.  It's in a quiet neighborhood, minutes from downtown/fairgrounds.  <br/>Susan and her pet dog Ari were were great hosts!  Occasionally meeting mornings in the kitchen where she would have a freshly brewed pot of coffee and a wealth of tips for the area.  And her fresh out of the oven blueberry muffins were the best!!<br/>Next time I'm in town, I hope I can stay here again!!"

Minutes from downtown and the Capitol.  Couldn't ask for more!<br/>On top of everything, her laundry room was open so I could do a  load while running errands, come back and do another.

The room, bathroom and sitting room were very spacious, wonderfully decorated and very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable and the house is in a quiet neighborhood. Susan went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable -- she let me check in early, greeted me with homemade muffins, and had coffee and breakfast foods available in the fridge. She even helped me get some packages to the post office when I was in a pinch! All in all, a fantastic stay I would highly recommend."

The bed was comfortable and private, and the bathroom was much larger than expected, with anything you might need.  I felt at home in the kitchen, where she had coffee and some amazing lemon blueberry muffins (YUM!).  <br/><br/>The neighborhood was adorable - really well kept homes, and completely safe.  She is located five minutes from the freeway and from downtown.  It was really easy to get around. <br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and wish it could have been longer.  Thank you for being an exceptional hostess!"

20035307,206723292,2017-10-26,28231331,Derrek,"Simple accommodations, but if you are looking for a nice place to stay in Salem Susan's place keys the bill. Only thing missing is a tv."
20035307,208712429,2017-11-02,152909003,Samantha,"Everything I wanted in my Airbnb. Susan is a perfect hostess. Her home was clean, stylish, and very comfortable."
20035307,210482489,2017-11-09,129659597,Liz,Susan's place is such a great cozy space. All the privacy you need while still having the opportunity to meet and chat if you want. The bathroom is spacious and the bed is super comfy and warm! Susan was a generous and wonderful host and her doggy was such a gentleman. =]
20035307,211439042,2017-11-12,92074789,Alexandra,Susan was so welcoming and provided the perfect space for a relaxing weekend. Her home is very zen. The private bedroom and Susan’s private space are well sound insulated from one another—we were each sure the other party might have heard the other laughing until pretty late but it was not a problem. When we initially arrive Susan shared some fresh beef stew she had just made and every morning there was coffee in the pot. The bed was also super comfortable (has a heated blanket!) with a generous private bathroom. The WiFi is fast and the location is a short drive from Willamette University and down town.
20035307,212033076,2017-11-15,25620333,Phil,Great space and thoughtful host.
20035307,216641180,2017-12-04,101166249,Andrew,"Susan was a very kind host and made sure we had everything we needed for the stay. She was a good conversationalist and very easy to get along with.<br/>Her home is fairly large and we had access to a living room with a fireplace, a bedroom, personal bathroom, and kitchen/dining room.<br/>Susan stayed in the house we occupied, albeit in a different section (demarcated by doors that had “Private” signs on them). Because Susan was so gracious it was not unwelcome; however, if you’re looking for a place where you can have the entire house and its facilities to yourself, this may not be the place for you. Overall, a lovely stay."
20035307,218021901,2017-12-10,150158201,Claudia,"Susan's home is lovely, quiet and comfortable. The bedroom and bathroom are very private and cozy. She is a personable and accommodating person who will join you in conversation or leave you alone, whichever you prefer. Next time I am in Salem I hope I can stay with her."
20035307,220531940,2017-12-22,12383454,Jay,"Very pleasant stay at Susan's place. Her house is super clean, and is tastefully decorated. Though the kitchen is shared, Susan makes the kitchen available to guests almost as if it were their own. I appreciated the short and easy commute to my workplace on State Street, too."
20035307,221204416,2017-12-25,147969786,Kathleen,"I couldn't have asked for a better experience: convenient location,  quiet neighborhood, comfy bed, nicely-equipped kitchen,  simple yet tasteful decor,  and a gracious hostess. If I ever have occasion to need a room in Salem again, this is where I want to be."
20035307,222415784,2017-12-29,79849669,Christina,"Perfect, centrally located home....clean and comfy."
20035307,228625873,2018-01-20,44178482,Minda,"Susan's place is an oasis in the city. Great value -- practically a whole place to yourself (private bedroom, bathroom, living room, dining room, and entrance). Very clean and comfortable. Susan was a wonderful host, good for a conversation, but she was also very respectful of my privacy."
20035307,229469099,2018-01-23,12863036,Chris,Clean well decorated space. Close to downtown Salem. 
20035307,232431358,2018-02-04,117975027,Karen,"Susan is a friendly and generous host, and her little dog is also friendly and exuberant. A great deal of effort clearly went into making the space aesthetically pleasing. It was very clean and nice linens. A nice relaxing living room and dining area. The kitchen is shared, but Susan is very accommodating and makes you feel at ease like you are staying at a relative's home."
20035307,233468597,2018-02-09,165829723,James,I had a great stay here! Close to downtown and restaurants. She was also very accommodating. I recommend staying here!

20035307,246565094,2018-03-25,79849669,Christina,What another delightful stay at this sweet and inviting home.  The kindness the host showed my grandgirls was appreciated...they especially liked the fairy wings and wand! Thank you!!
20035307,248156413,2018-03-30,91405387,Robert And Shanna,Susan's place is nestled in a well established neighborhood with mature trees and immaculately kept and maintained homes just minutes from downtown.  On her property were large Tulip Magnolia trees in full bloom making for a fresh spring feel.  We enjoyed staying there and Susan is a wealth of information as far as things to do locally.  We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Salem.
20035307,251299979,2018-04-07,182215150,Nathan,"Susan is amazing! Do not miss this place if you can book it, you'll have an amazing stay and leave with a new friend."
20035307,258819086,2018-04-29,57461059,Janim,"Both Susan and her place were lovely! She made sure we had everything we needed, and made us feel at home. Would definitely stay at her place again."
20035307,260401785,2018-05-04,74058270,Michele,"Great stay. Very clean, stylish, and comfortable place to stay. Very reasonably priced. Susan was a great host. We shared the kitchen, but the beautiful living and dining area was my space. Large bedroom and bathroom. Very comfortable bed. Susan had thoughtful touches like fresh flowers, great coffee, and breakfast items in the fridge. Great neighborhood to walk in. Would highly recommend and plan to stay again."
20035307,262119645,2018-05-07,4147086,Steven,A very good value. Susan is sweet and does her best to be accomodating.
20035307,264794636,2018-05-14,177212295,Rodney,"This is a charming, well-kept, quiet, beautiful place. It is only matched by Susan's care and hospitably. She is ready to chat and just as conscientious to your need for quite. <br/><br/>A gem in Salem."
20035307,270253574,2018-05-28,70092499,Naveen,"Susan's place is a great one to stay! It is right in the middle of the town in a residential area.  The place was very beautiful and well maintained. We get a private room, living room and the kitchen is shared. The bedroom had heated blankets which was a plus :). <br/><br/>Susan was a caring and an amazing host, she answered our questions pretty quickly and also ensured there was no problem with us arriving later than the check in time. Our check in was very smooth and she gave a quick tour of the house and left the place to ourselves.  Susan also had breakfast items for us like yogurt, cereals, fruits, juice etc.<br/><br/>We would recommend this place to anyone who want a good place to stay in Salem. We will definitely stay here the next time we visit Salem!"
20035307,271955602,2018-06-02,44178482,Minda,"Susan's home is a perfect blend of hospitality and privacy. It is comfortable, clean, and quiet (except for occasional early morning train horns). Good, central location in a residential neighborhood. Walking distance to a park; short drive to downtown. My third time here, and it's always great. REALLY comfy pillows on the bed!"
20035307,275260785,2018-06-10,100933152,Erin,"Susan was super sweet and made us feel so at home. The room was really cute and comfortable. Great location, quite neighborhood but close to the freeway and town."
20035307,276445768,2018-06-13,5026321,David,"Susan’s home was impeccable, and truly elevated my expectations for what an Airbnb should look like. She had snacks, water, and food available, even without advertising. Susan was a delight to chat with in the few moments we crossed paths, and she made my visit to Salem such a delight. Highly recommend her place and a stay with her. "
20035307,277171296,2018-06-15,169245103,Joshua,"I’ve stayed at quite a few Air BnBs and Susan as a host blows everyone out of the water. She is extremely warm, pleasant and friendly. Rooms were extremely clean and smelled amazing. I hope anyone who comes to Salem picks Susan’s humble abode to stay at."
20035307,281444000,2018-06-24,189586191,Jason,She really went above and beyond to make this a welcome place!
20035307,283335243,2018-06-29,181008400,Erin B,"Susan is extremely kind and accommodating. I had to drive to Salem to take a 4-hour test at the major testing center there.  Susan's home is only about 6 minutes away.   She was extremely thoughtful and helpful, and her home is very friendly and quiet. I was able to study and collect my thoughts the day before the exam in a stress-free environment, and I think it made a big difference. Her home was fantastic, and it was really convenient being able to use the kitchen as well. I would absolutely stay here again. Definitely recommend!"
20035307,285450767,2018-07-03,189720594,Kristy,We loved our stay with Susan!
20035307,289196386,2018-07-11,20011163,Erin,"We enjoyed our stay at Susan's while we were visiting family in Stayton. Communication was so easy, and we felt at home instantly. Susan was so friendly and welcoming, and it was nice running into her in the kitchen in the morning. The small touches like flowers and snacks in the fridge were so nice, and the bed was incredibly comfortable. We wouldn't hesitate to stay with Susan again if we're in the area!"
20035307,292350412,2018-07-17,4732468,Osvaldo,Susan’s space was amazing it was the perfect place to unwind after a long day non stop day. It was extremely clean and well kept. The small details all around the space really added to the experience. <br/><br/>Susan had different small amenities available. She had snacks available in case one may need them. She had some basic toiletries available in case I had forgotten something. I had never seen this level of attention from any other Airbnb I had stayed in before!<br/><br/>Overall the place is amazing and you will not regret making this place your stop when in Salem.
20035307,310618076,2018-08-19,191100408,Rita,"Susan is definitely a Superhost! Her place is clean, comfortable, and conveniently located. She is very accommodating and friendly. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay there again!"
20035307,312124928,2018-08-22,105863522,Deborah,"I L-O-V-E Susan's guest space.  The decor, color and style, suited me perfectly, bringing calm and serenity.  I was pleasantly surprised to have not only private bathroom but also private sitting room.  Loved the quiet and privacy.  Susan was available just behind a door in her private quarters for any questions or for a chat."
20035307,314484956,2018-08-26,1818813,Leanne,"The previous reviews are all very accurate! What a lovely and comfortable home, gracious host, and great location. "
20035307,316679464,2018-08-31,177218482,Rosie,Susan's place is so peaceful and full of positive energy!  She is a total delight.  She went out of her way to find me a few things that I thought I might need and each day there was soothing music playing.  I would absolutely recommend staying here and will so again if the opportunity arises.
20035307,318521760,2018-09-03,92727880,Brenda,Susan was so gracious and welcoming ! We will definitely try to stay with her again in the future. We appreciated the amount of private space we were given and found everything clean and cozy !
20035307,319969515,2018-09-07,212878606,Rives,"Susan is the best.  The house is pretty nice too, but seriously.  Do stay here, and make sure you have a coffee in the morning and chat with Susan a bit.  Ask her about her travels and her work.  You won't regret it.  <br/><br/>And of course as a result of Susan's kindness, her place is well stocked, clean, and wonderful.  She'll make sure you've eaten enough.  Necessities are provided and then some. The house has a good vibe and is very well kept. I have trouble sleeping usually, and I slept like a baby here."
20035307,321172543,2018-09-09,30240385,Larissa,"We were in town for a wedding and found Susan's place. It looked lovely and we had very high expectations for our trip. Even with our expectations Susan went above and beyond and made our trip so easy and delightful! We were driving up from Northern California and due to a fire we were rerouted adding many hours to our trip. This caused us to be arriving close to midnight. Luckily, Susan was so amazing and accommodating and welcomed us warmly in the late hours of the night. To top it all off we had brought our ESA dog with us and were going to leave her with friends or with a sitter for the day we were there but I reached out to Susan and she graciously allowed us to keep our fur baby with us in our room. What could have easily turned into quite a hassle was not a problem at all thanks to Susan's incredible hospitality. If you're in town for any reason I definitely recommend staying with Susan. Not only will she be one of the best hosts, but the space is lovely and she even provided waters and snacks for us in the kitchen. What a great stay we had. Thanks Susan!"
20035307,323495052,2018-09-15,129332830,Justin,"Susan was great, the place was quiet and very clean. I loved the decor and am stealing her interior design ideas for the bathroom. 10/10"
20035307,330666045,2018-09-30,213792307,David,"What a lovely experience we had at this Salem Airbnb! This property was immaculately clean and delightfully, yet simply, decorated and furnished. Extra pillows, blankets, towels, and bathroom amenities were already provided, as were breakfast supplies in the refrigerator and kitchen. The host is gracious and welcoming, yet respects the privacy wishes of her guests. We would stay at this property and recommend it to friends and family in a heartbeat!"
20035307,331828308,2018-10-03,197703079,Douglas,"We stayed with Susan while visiting some friends.  Her home is very lovely, she was a great host.  Comfortable home and nice place to rest for the nights we were in town."
20035307,337231111,2018-10-15,8673572,John,"I can't say enough about Susan and her hospitality. Staying with her felt like staying with family, and I would recommend her to anyone. Susan was more accommodating than even our loftiest expectations and the place itself was immaculate and well stocked with everything a traveler could possibly want. Even her dog, Ari, was a total sweetheart! Would stay again."
20035307,341357735,2018-10-26,13996188,David,"Susan was a very thorough and attentive host, going so far as to offer me train station pick up. The home was very clean and orderly, the room for guests was clearly made into a private space. There is a full bath in the guest room, and guests can have free reign of the rest of the house. The space made me a little worried that my late night going and coming might disturb Susan. I would not recommend this space for folks looking to have a bit more of a carousing adventure in Salem."
20035307,342494543,2018-10-28,40234737,Sherry,"Susan was a super host, her place was quiet & very conveniently located only 1.5 miles from Willamette Univ. where I was visiting my son!"

20035307,348115509,2018-11-12,124425543,Chris,My 2-night stay was great. Susan is a gracious host and offered some wonderful suggestions for places to eat.
20035307,350240979,2018-11-18,188264004,Lauren,"The thing that struck me the most was how everything in the house was part of the overall atmosphere of calmness and serenity. While I was on a trip mostly for business and had little time at the house, I still enjoyed the soothing colors and Asian-influenced decor. The furniture is also simple, but elegant, as well as comfortable. Susan herself was a delightful hostess, whether we were talking about the weather or sharing our stories with each other. I would highly recommend Susan's home for anyone seeking a home to relax in."
20035307,352096395,2018-11-24,17877936,Barbara,"Very clean, quiet, comfy and convenient place to stay.  Easy parking.  Susan is a lovely host. As an older person traveling solo I felt very safe at Susan’s.  So glad I booked it!"
20035307,355367532,2018-12-03,138986778,Pamela,"Susan's description of her space and amenities is accurate.  Found the space inviting, homey and very comfortable (loved reading by the fireplace).  <br/><br/>It's in a quiet neighborhood, that along with a very comfy bed offered a great night's sleep (which is very important to my husband and I). <br/><br/>Susan was a very thoughtful and personable host, checking in periodically to ensure all was going well with our stay, which was much appreciated.<br/><br/>I was a little anxious about the shared kitchen space (hadn't done this before) and it turned out just fine. Susan gave us fridge space, explained the basics of the kitchen, left us healthy snacks and provided coffee in the morning (all we had to do was push a button). <br/><br/>I had a workshop in downtown Salem and this was a great location for ease of access, only a couple of miles away (easily walked in decent weather).  <br/><br/>I would recommend Susan's space and would stay there again in a heartbeat."
20035307,355996605,2018-12-06,65387203,Jillian,"Susan was a wonderful host! I arrived pretty late in the evening and she was there waiting to show me all the little tips and tricks to make my stay extra enjoyable. I loved that there was a fireplace and electric blanket, as it was very cold outside when I arrived and I had been in the car much of the day. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and her place was sparkling clean with nice little extra touches for her guests. The neighborhood was quiet and safe with plenty of street parking. I would definitely recommend her place and would stay here again."
20035307,359742163,2018-12-17,5620111,Ardith,"Susan was very welcoming and greeted us when we arrived in Salem. The house is in a cute neighborhood, and it was located very close to where we needed to be all weekend for a wedding. <br/><br/>The house was cozy, and we appreciated the coffee and snacks available! I also certainly loved the added touch of an electric blanket on the bed.<br/><br/>Overall, we had a good stay and would recommend Susan and her space. Thank you again."

You’ll appreciate the tapestry and cultured decorations, hand crafted wooden furniture and the dual blanket warmer in the bed. The home feels newly renovated and the bedroom has a private vibe to it with nice, natural lighting. The quarters included the main living room section of the house, kitchen and bedroom/bathroom which are all spacious. Susan had just the right amount of interaction with a host as we like. We met her upon check in and were provided two keys and a brief set of instructions for around the home. The home is located just a few minutes drive from just about anywhere and Susan even offered to take us a few minutes down the road to a friends wedding we were attending. Super host move :)"

20035307,541072231,2019-10-04,230874858,Bahiyyih,"My spouse and I were in town for a wedding and we enjoyed our stay in Susan’s home. In the evenings we enjoyed reading near the gas fireplace, the bed was comfortable, and the shower was nice. Susan supplied us with a variety of breakfast items to choose from and she was friendly. We also had fun giving some pets to Susan’s little dog Ari. This was a cozy place to stay."

From recommendations for restaurant’s to furniture stores Susan was not only a great host but a great guide as well. I can’t recommend staying here enough.
20035307,598725538,2020-01-27,17836072,LeighAnn,"Quiet and cozy with lots of thoughtful touches. Susan struck just the right balance of checking in and giving space. She had lots of kitchen things I didn’t take full advantage of, but I enjoyed the granola bars :-) Also, I run cold and really appreciated the electric blanket, extra blanket, and space heater."

Combination LR/DR with comfortable furniture, attractive DR set, and gas fireplace.  Shared kitchen is bright and sunny and equipped with anything you would need.  Spotlessly clean bathroom.  A very comfortable space, with a graciously welcoming hostess, and a short drive to downtown and the state capital complex.  Ample street parking.  We highly recommend it."

20035307,405106863910670260,2021-07-12,93488577,Kim,"Susan is such a lovely, generous host. The space was very tranquil and spotless in a safe and friendly neighborhood.m with easy parking. The cost was fantastic and made a week long stay affordable. As has been mentioned, the kitchen is shared and Susan lives in the adorable house too, in rooms in the back of the space.  I throughly enjoyed the suite with the large bath and bedroom, but some may not consider it ‘your own space’. Given the price point, I don’t have any complaints as I would have happily paid for the space to be in a shared home. Thank you Susan!"
20035307,416667704131366344,2021-07-28,12194822,Geena,"Our stay here was fantastic. This was the first time we've stayed at a home with a shared space. Susan was awesome, she did a short tour with us upon our arrival. Areas in the kitchen were set aside for us to store our food. This was great. Lights in common spaces were automated so we didn't have to worry about being in the dark. We felt very much at home. Susan provided so many things more than I've seen in other AirBnB's. It was the small touches that made the big difference. Her home is very clean, neatly organized, comfortable and centrally located with shopping and dining in close proximity. I would absolutely recommend staying here. It was the perfect home away from home for our week in Oregon."
20035307,427519943927397760,2021-08-12,69888370,Karen,"Susan's place is a comfortable calm bungalow in a lovely quiet neighborhood on the flats of Salem, great for biking or walking to downtown coffeeshops & parks, & not far from shopping, I-5 destinations, etc. Susan is a great host, giving interaction or space as desired. We brought bikes, which she made space for inside.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there & would happily choose it again for a visit to Salem!"
20035307,435500327219747321,2021-08-23,412496220,Dawn,"My mom and I loved staying in this beautiful home.  It was very clean, conveniently located, and affordable. Susan was a gracious host and made us feel very comfortable and at home. She thought of everything from fresh fruit and snacks to leaving a light on for us when we were out past dark.  Although she does occupy the back of the house, we rarely saw her except when she checked in on us to make sure we had all we needed."

20072558,186886718,2017-08-25,2716754,Faith,Judy and Ray were awesome - Lots of aloha!  They were so attentive to the DETAILS and they really made me feel at home. The cottage was very private and in a quiet neighborhood.  Just 10 minutes away from downtown Salem.  Parking was easy - right outside the cottage.  Judy had all the amenities of a hotel and more.  I would highly recommend Myrtle Cottage.
20072558,202320851,2017-10-10,131921980,Pat,Great quiet private cottage in a very nice quiet neighborhood.  Fruit and cheese and croissants waiting for us. I loved soaking in the antique claw foot tub. We were able to relax and Judy gave us great restaurant recommendations. Well decorated and comfortable with WiFi and a great tv
20072558,218443807,2017-12-12,135078220,Tristan,"Judy and Ray were very gracious and accommodating hosts! Myrtle Cottage is a perfect place to stay for any traveler. Judy is a great resource for fun things to do in the area. They were also very nice, understanding, and helpful when some issues with the AirBnB site came up. I would highly recommend this place for short term stays 😊"

Great stay, Judy was ultra fast at responding to messages I sent. We didn’t see them at all during our visit, which we actually prefer, to be honest. Awesome amenities and thoughtful hosts! Two thumbs up!"
20072558,269713730,2018-05-27,37186204,Pam,"Judy and Ray's cottage is set up beautifully with care and lots of amenities.  I liked the comfortable chairs for reading, well-stocked mini-kitchen, and handsome space throughout.  Judy was very responsive on our only hiccup,  when I goofed and turned off the wi-fi access."
20072558,271596122,2018-06-01,160758863,Claudia,Judy was a fabulous host. All the small details did not go unnoticed! A very clean and quite cottage that made it very easy to relax in. It made our stay so pleasant! Thank you!

20072558,308122875,2018-08-15,204638981,Linda,Myrtle cottage is wonderful.  Peaceful and quiet. Clean and cozy. Perfect for one or two people. Judy is a lovely host and added nice personal touches to the guest house. The cottage is centrally located and easily navigated. The neighborhood is nice and was a great place to take a morning walk before starting your day. Judy thought of everything. I highly recommend staying at Mrytle Cottage.
20072558,323487647,2018-09-15,195078808,Cory,"Unfortunately we did not have a good experience here. We planned to stay for three months, but because of issues with the place that stay had to be cut short. It was much smaller than expected. There was no way to cook at all, which we were led to believe there would be. We even specifically asked the host about that before booking. We had to clean webs off the walls because there were a lot of spiders. We had to kill 4-5 a day. The bed was very loud and squeaks with any movement at all. The shower was nice but it dripped for hours after it was used. If you opened the bathroom door before all the steam cleared out it set the fire alarm off. <br/><br/>Overall the biggest disappointment was our loss of money after the host didn’t honor our agreement. We had several conversations with the host before paying to come to a fair agreement, as the place didn’t have an honest description of the property. The host was very nice and even understanding, up until it came time to actually make the changes.  Suddenly she starting avoiding us for some reason, which was very frustrating. Unfortunately we were very let down and lost a lot of money because of this. It ended up being ridiculously expensive for what it was, and we would not stay here again."

It's located in a very nice area. Judy provided us with a list of places to eat and to visit and, since we're thinking of moving to the area, the best places to live. We would definitely return. My only caveat would be that it's a fairly large step to get into the tub/shower, which might be of concern to some (it wasn't to us). Highly recommended!"
20072558,610167679,2020-02-23,60091832,David,"Very clean, well-designed private space.  Judy was extremely responsive and very helpful."
20072558,613798427,2020-03-02,80208701,Richard,Great little place quiet area except occasional barking dog right next door whose fence was right up to the bedroom window. No real thermostat so the temps can vary quite a bit. Bathroom is very small with limited counter space. Shower is excellent with good pressure but very small and the shower curtain surrounds you and hugs you almost. If grossed out by that you won’t like the shower. It’s quite a climb to get into the tub for the shower and be careful to not touch the metal piping by the hot water as it can be very hot. WiFi is a TMobile Hotspot which was quite slow. Our Verizon phones were faster though the signal weak. Aside from this the place was great value and great attentive host.

The location is on a quiet street, only a short drive to our daughter’s house and was perfect for our stay while social distancing, visiting our daughter and looking at areas for our forever home. Judy was extremely responsive; we couldn’t have asked for a better host, location and accommodations."

20072558,717686611,2020-12-23,261828965,Trevor,Judy is a great host. Our first contact after the reserving on the website was a text message welcoming us. I was busy and forgot about it.

Thanks again for opening your home to us.

Judy is a great host, communicates well, is prompt with replies, and also gives information on local places to visit.  I was kept aware of anything going on around the property at all times, and overall it was a wonderful stay and so much better than a hotel even."

20072558,428310106659674314,2021-08-13,43598853,Kristi,Cute place. Easy checking. New A/C unit worked great in 100+ degree temperatures.

20072558,460895388121852820,2021-09-27,419415211,Nicholas,"Was not a fan. First time using Air B and B and probably wont try again. Thought I was going to save some money, that wasnt the case. Thought it was going to be cleaner than a 3 star hotel, that wasnt the case either. Miscommunication between me and the host when I asked her if i was paying for nights or days and she was incorrect but didnt tell me until I couldnt get a full refund. Ended up staying one of the nights in a family members camper. Sheets had sex stains on them. There was Ant traps around the house. No air conditioning and after I called to ask if she could give me new sheets she said the sheets were fine and that I was mistaken. Black hair in the bathtub. Just was not happy with my stay and would recommend to anyone else."
20072558,464577915187108436,2021-10-02,26502545,Megan,"We stayed at Myrtle Cottage which allowed us to go back and forth quickly and easily to Capital Manor to visit family members there. <br/>Myrtle Cottage was clean, private, and well appointed.

My stay was everything I could have hoped for.<br/>The cottage is comfortable, tranquil, and located in a lovely neighborhood.  It's within a few miles of all the amenities one might ask for, including the best used-book store in town.<br/>Judy Armstrong is an excellent host.  She is accommodating, kind and determined to make one's stay the best.  emw"

We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Salem!

Centrally located in West Salem, it was easy for us to visit our relatives 20 minutes away in Monmouth, and then turn around the next day and drive to the coast at Newport in an hour. The hosts are attentive and responsive and I highly recommend staying here!"

20072558,734123341396626476,2022-10-09,399984607,Kevin,"Very nice little place in a quiet part of West Salem. Judy was quick to communicate and help when we had questions. Everything was clean and attractive.<br/><br/>A few things to know, however. The cottage is quite small, and doesn't offer much space to stretch out. The description says that it has ""dedicated work space,"" but we couldn't figure out where that might have been. The bathroom has no counter space, and the raised clawfoot tub is a bit of a challenge when getting in and out. We discovered a step stool in the closet on the last day, which probably would have helped with the tub. As long as those minor issues aren't a problem, you should be very happy staying here."
20072558,747943928798427474,2022-10-28,481308047,Kathy,"Excellent stay.  Cozy, comfortable, and welcoming."

20231503,182054597,2017-08-13,23424441,Cara,"Elizabeth and her home are absolutely wonderful. The space was ideal for us and our Australian Shepherd while in Salem.

20231503,185864082,2017-08-22,95046469,Neel,"Elizabeth is really kind and helpful. My stay at her place was very comfortable. She took every possible effort to make us comfortable. We stayed at her place on eclipse weekend, when everything was booked in advance. She changed our room to accommodate 3 of us comfortably at the last moment, and we appreciated that a lot.  Our original bedroom was smaller to accommodate 3 people, but she made arrangements to accommodate us at such a short notice.<br/>I would definitely like to stay at her place once again. I would recommend her place to Everyone who's willing to spend some time in Salem."
20231503,205032273,2017-10-20,55351933,Kirra,Such a beautiful home and perfect coziness. It made my months of schooling so much more enjoyable knowing I had a home away from home. Highly recommend this home!!

20231503,292339452,2018-07-17,139328462,Matthew,"Elizabeth was a very gracious host. She made sure to meet us in person when we arrived and gave us a tour of our rooms and the premises. She also went out of the way to make sure some undecided family would have a place to stay. Elizabeth made room #2 available to us for booking in addition to room #4 that we had already booked. Even though it was a smaller room, #2 had every thing we needed, every thing that was listed, and even some extras(sewing kit, spare toothbrush, eyeglass repair kit). If you need anything but don't see it(iron and board), just ask and odds are that Elizabeth can make it available. The property is beautiful and shaded and the pool was a welcome relief from the heat. If ever we are in Salem again we will look to book with Elizabeth first. Thank you again Elizabeth!"

20231503,567107376,2019-11-21,2143228,Cynthia,The elephant room is so cute.  First time I stayed in this room.  Nice plush rugs and hot shower.  Awesome.  And the carrot cake was yummy!
20231503,568812027,2019-11-24,2295014,Michelle,Very comfortable and convenient location.
20231503,569832044,2019-11-27,48328313,Elizabeth,Stayed with Elizabeth all too briefly. A wonderful oasis on my long California to Canada drive. The room with bathroom was outstanding. And she welcomed my dog too.
20231503,571096020,2019-11-30,49760712,Lucas,Elizabeth's home is beautiful and historic. Can't beat it for a cosy night in a beautiful neighborhood. Also can't beat the hot tub on a cold night!
20231503,573984345,2019-12-07,185540004,John,"Wonderful older, well kept home.  Lots of space.  Everything you need is provided.  Quick response by owner."
20231503,577703240,2019-12-15,102535180,Emily,"Elizabeth is a fantastic host and this home is so cool! If you like cozy rooms, fresh baked loaves, and the feel of a 18th century inn then you have to stay here 🙌"
20231503,578123266,2019-12-16,95029930,Elena,"Elizabeth's place was very stylish and lifted up our holiday spirits during our CA to WA move before the holidays. We had everything we could imagine to ask for in our room. Lisa met us in person, made sure the hot tub was ready since I was specifically asking if it's still open in December. My husband and I had a very relaxing and luxurious experience our second moving night. For breakfast we had a lot to choose from: yogurt, muffins, coffee & tea, fruits, and oatmeal. So we were able to save some time in the morning and drive long time before stopping for lunch. We also came by a big van, and Elizabeth marked a parking spot for us, and we had no problems fitting in. All our stay we were very warm and safe. When it was time to get back on the road, I met a very friendly black kitty outside that kept purring and asking for pets 🙂 If I am ever in Salem, I would love to stay at Elizabeth's place for a longer time--it was amazing."
20231503,579459588,2019-12-20,306624546,Dani,"Luxurious bedding. Elizabeth is super friendly and easy going. Pet friendly. The hot tub made for a relaxing evening and morning. We stayed here while visiting family in the neighborhood. This was the perfect affordable spot, with an amazing king bed! Thank you!!"
20231503,579874208,2019-12-21,28316593,Ashley,"Everything here was PERFECT. Elizabeth is the best host/hostess I have ever had the pleasure of staying with. The home itself is historical and fascinating. The entire day felt like Christmas itself with all of the decorations. I cannot wait to stay in the other rooms and if you get a chance to have her host you, do NOT miss it. She does not disappoint! Just look at her other reviews. I had the best night sleep as well. I could go on and on, but you get the point ;) Looking forward to staying again!"
20231503,582303332,2019-12-26,306624546,Dani,"Our second time staying at Elizabeth’s was just as lovely and inviting as our first time there! The communal spaces felt private and welcoming, and we were always excited to see what the baked good of the day is. We really enjoyed the hot tub both in the evenings and the mornings. The bedding was luxurious and so comfortable. We were able to leave our dogs in the room with no issues, and there was plenty of space to walk the dogs both on the property and in the neighborhood. There is also an amazing dog park just a few minutes drive away- Minto Brown. Elizabeth is super easy going and loving towards our four legged family members. 5 stars, absolutely recommend!"
20231503,582826800,2019-12-27,103385076,Julie,"Very accommodating stay! My only critique is the occasional smell of cat litter. There is a dog, 4 cats, 2 tortoises and an array of poultry but they are kept in separate rooms, however I still was able to smell the animals."
20231503,583402241,2019-12-28,217326201,Iris,"Definitely a nice place to stay, very private and quiet. Super clean and warm. Had all the amenities and if you forgot something, Elizabeth had plenty of toiletries."
20231503,586347415,2020-01-01,306624546,Dani,"We love Elizabeth’s so much- third time staying here and it’s perfect! So much charm, freshly baked goods everyday, perfect little hot tub, and she always says hello to our dogs too! Thank you Elizabeth!"

20231503,598701741,2020-01-27,49493555,Susan,"You can expect a beautiful Tudor style home tastefully decorated and easy to find.  I stayed in room 2 which was small but very nicely decorated.  The king size bed is super comfortable!  There's a small fridge, micro, coffee maker, plates, glasses...etc....everything has been thought about.  Although I only stayed one night and didn't get a chance to enjoy the grounds it's very beautifully decorated and inviting!  I will stay again!!"

Lovely neighborhood and welcoming home. Tons of foods and other necessities provided, feeling like a home away from home. The bed was super comfy and the en-suite bathroom was really convenient.

20231503,650240883,2020-08-12,167609398,Julian,"This is truly the best place to stay if you're visiting Salem.<br/><br/> I came here a little spontaneously but the host, Elizabeth, still went out of her way to accommodate. She set me up in the upstairs room, the bed perfectly made, everything very clean -- and yet not in the cold and sterile way most hotels and AirBnbs prepare their rooms. Instead the room displayed so much warmth and character: antique furniture, travel posters and maps hanging across the walls; all the striking beauty that surrounds, like a landscape of Oregon mountains outside the windows. Plus, I had my own bathroom, thoughtfully fully-stocked with emergency toothpaste, toothbrushes, emergency sanitary pads and so much more. I was impressed by all of this -- so imagine then how I felt when she moved me to the master bedroom. <br/><br/>Beyond the accommodations, which I will reiterate: acutely prepared for the traveler (coffee-maker, snacks, spare water bottles, etc.) -- I think my time here will be defined as exceptionally inviting as far as AirBnbs, or individuals, go. It is clear that Elizabeth -- hard-working, industrious and ever-considerate throughout my stay -- is a rightful super-host. Because staying here can only be compared to visiting dear friends you haven't seen since forever. Or like an escape to some scenic inn, safe and far-removed from the rowdy world that lies beyond. Or simply like visiting family. I'm so fortunate to have stumbled upon this place."
20231503,657970648,2020-08-29,233758297,Matt,This is by far the best place I've stayed with Air BnB! This is the only place I will stay from now on when traveling to Salem. You are not going to find a better home or a better host!
20231503,658744875,2020-08-30,157909441,Cameron,Welcoming host and cozy room. Elizabeth baked fresh banana bread for us!

We received a welcome message almost immediately, and continued communication until we arrived at 10pm. The house was easy to find (about 4 miles off the 5 Freeway into Salem), ample parking with good lighting, and her home is absolutely beautiful. Letting ourselves in went flawlessly with her precise directions. The room was great; nicely decorated, well stocked, super clean and comfortable! We slept very well. We would definitely recommend staying at Elizabeth’s home!"

She was prompt, kind, and very hospitable. Met me at the door, got me into my room, and made sure I had everything I needed for the stay."
20231503,670251897,2020-10-02,71885627,Vera,Elizabeth is a wonderful host and went above and beyond. The room was fully stocked with everything you could possibly think of.

20231503,709504153,2020-11-16,193160831,Elizabeth,"I love staying at this property. It really feels like a home away from home. While there are other guests staying at the property at the same time, it feels like a good balance of quiet and feeling that other people are present somewhere not so very far away. <br/><br/>The grounds are soothing and well-cared for and there are always goodies to munch on, but not too many goodies, just enough, and then there's always fruit and coffee :)"

I think the real thing is better than the pictures, I was surprised when we arrived because the room was much better than I expected. I didn’t meet personally, but she quickly responded to my messages and was very kind. The house was unbelievably cute I loved it. Plus it has a pool and jacuzzi, is close to downtown, and Elizabeth provides all the toiletries a girl could need. Also there was freshly baked sweets for us when we arrived! A fantastic stay."

20231503,745074093,2021-04-03,174231186,Jessenia,This a great place to stay! Everything is set up nicely and instructions are easy to follow. The location of the Airbnb is perfect there’s a lot of restaurants and stores nearby. She also has a binder that I found very informational from what to eat and what to do in the area.
20231503,745667309,2021-04-04,85189359,Stephanie,"Elizabeth’s place is not only GORGEOUS but her hospitality is top notch.<br/>She included so many extra little goodies that made for the perfect stay. Including fresh baked goods, fruit, coffee, shampoo, makeup wipes...you name it. The backyard is quaint and the location is near anything you’d need!"
20231503,746249123,2021-04-05,78244609,Debbie,Elizabeth has a beautiful place. Very clean. Would stay again . She was very helpful and responsive.
20231503,746907636,2021-04-08,142890646,Mohammad S K Shazzad,One of our best Airbnb stays. Very clean place with all amenities you can ask for. Super comfy bed. We also like the decoration of the room very much. You will feel a sense of artistry in everywhere. Elizabeth was super helpful and very kind to us. Would recommend anyone.
20231503,747193805,2021-04-09,33458462,Carolyn,"It’s always wonderful to stay at Elizabeth’s! This was my first time in the elephant room, which was very very comfortable! The bed was incredible – firm enough, but soft, too.  There were snacks, coffee, tea, and yogurt in the room, and banana bread in the morning with fruit outside on the landing."
20231503,751313613,2021-04-23,142511276,Rachel,Truly the best Airbnb stay we’ve ever had! Space was clean and so beautifully decorated. Elizabeth was incredibly kind and welcoming and made our stay in Salem outstanding!
20231503,753427830,2021-04-30,9055630,Sonja,"This is a hidden gem.. beautiful, charming character and with every convenience.   The bed was super comfortable and shower great.. I highly recommend."
20231503,754260076,2021-05-02,85219183,Gloria,What can I say.... Elizabeth’s place is my home away from home! Would never stay anywhere else!
20231503,756224315,2021-05-08,12486883,Robert,Very well-provisioned. Very thoughtful host. Would not hesitate to stay here again while in Salem. A very good value.
20231503,756852842,2021-05-09,2917792,Selin,Very nice and affordable place to stay in Salem. The in room coffee maker was much appreciated and baked goods on the landing were a sweet touch
20231503,757373146,2021-05-11,93736704,Cheryl,"The elephant room was just as described, super clean, had all I needed for a stopover in the area. I would recommend it especially for 1 guest - for two if you’re happy in intimate spaces together :) Elizabeth was timely responding, check-in was very easy, the location is close to downtown Salem.  Even though a room in a (gorgeous) house, I felt private and secure."
20231503,757841486,2021-05-13,291919294,Bonnie,Nice cozy home in great neighborhood.  Close to get anywhere in Salem or go to the Ocean.  Comfortable beds and nice bathrooms.
20231503,759706390,2021-05-17,678491,Lisa,"This is a fantastic place to stay.  I can't say enough about the level of thought Elizabeth has put into her place.  Each room has a theme (I stayed in the Elephant room) and she's thought of all the things you might need with baskets of personal supplies from toothpaste, to q-tips and everything in between.  In addition to coffee with all the fixings, there is a full supply of snacks included in your room and little touches I've never seen elsewhere such as water bottles with ""Congratulations to [my Willamette grad's name]"".  Every day there is fruit and baked goods laid out and Elizabeth checks in regularly.  I've stayed at Elizabeth's place twice and I wish I could stay here every time I visit.  All that AND the best price I've found in Salem.   Highly recommended!!!"
20231503,760170186,2021-05-19,297749961,Zaye,"The listing is outdated and inaccurate. It states that there's space in the kitchen for guests to prepare and cook their meals, however, upon trying to cook, I realized the entire stove was broken... I messaged her in regards to that and she told me that the kitchen is actually completely off-limits due to covid so inaccurate description. also the bathroom had really bad Plumbing issues to the point where water was flooding on the floor. there was no plunger in that bathroom also there was someone's hair on the floor which shows it was not completely sterilized. the room wasn't Superbad the sheets and towels were clean however, the entire place was really dusty and you can tell it was not sanitized. also there's cats there and I have bad allergies so kind of sucked but she definitely be added to the description. overall the place is not as described and some amenities are not available. The living room was a mess."
20231503,761044322,2021-05-22,214024260,Janet,Elizabeth has thought of everything   It is the best experience from the moment you book the room to check out. Thereare so many wonderful touches from the extra toothbrushes if you forgot yours to the-home baked goodies left each morning. I can’t-say enough wonderful-things about Elizabeth’s home and her hospitality. This is a definite 10 in my book.
20231503,763436362,2021-05-28,55713385,Natalie,"A great place to stay! Has everything you need. Kind hosts, who even did my laundry before I continued my travels! I’d recommend staying here."
20231503,763855942,2021-05-29,102881540,Aaron,"Very clean, safe area, thoughtful amenities. 5 stars all around!<br/><br/>I’ve stayed in many Airbnbs since 2016, and Elizabeth’s place tops the list with the most thoughtful amenities and touches. Would highly recommend this stay."
20231503,767542394,2021-06-06,27862305,Andrew,Elizabeth’s home was absolutely wonderful. The location is perfect and she provides a great guestbook with lots of fun and exciting things to see and do around town. She was very warm and welcoming when I arrived. My room had so many snacks and little amenities to include a mini fridge and microwave. The bed was comfortable and the neighborhood quiet. The only regret I have is that I couldn’t spend more time! Highly recommend staying at Elizabeth’s.
20231503,769399203,2021-06-12,79911707,Megan,"Lovely, cozy, cute decor. I was very comfortable and more than everything I needed was provided. Lots of super thoughtful touches. Would recommend and stay again!"

20231503,389163104097207955,2021-06-20,27180873,Marcy,"We had a wonderful stay here. The room, while slightly small, had everything one would hope for - en-suite bathroom, microwave, fridge, and TV in room, good WiFi, plenty of clean towels and little travel size items in case you forgot anything. The house and grounds were charming and lovely. We also appreciated being able to use the hot tub after a long day of driving! My only complaint would be that the bed was a tad soft for my liking - I prefer firmer support, but the mattress could be perfect for someone else. Overall, a great place to stay!"
20231503,393442826277061056,2021-06-26,87857033,Rohit,Great location and value for money

20231503,399311960771974136,2021-07-04,287260195,Richard,"Our stay was a much needed, relaxing and stress free getaway.  I can't think of one thing they forgot in their abundant supplies to ensure the happiness of their clients.  All in all, a simply wonderful visit.  Quiet and peaceful, a perfect little place to unwind and enjoy their beautiful grounds and landscaping, and comfortable rooms to exploring this historical home.  Definitely a place I would gladly recommend."

Elizabeth offers  fruit and homebaked muffins and breads daily, stocks the mini-fridge with yogurts and water bottles, and the  room with snacks to enjoy all day.  She offers a cooked breakfast but I never felt the need to ask.  We will definitely come back when we make another Oregon trip."

20231503,410138907123338878,2021-07-19,409503797,Tami,This is a welcoming room in a quiet and beautiful historic home.  There are a lot of personal touches and the host is quite nice.  It was rare to find such a dog-friendly and affordable place.  It's worth the short drive from the freeway if you are heading up or down I5.
20231503,410867858934106775,2021-07-20,50025870,Chris,"One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed at. The Elephant room had lots of personality and was stocked with any kind of supplies imaginable, and  even things I didn’t know I needed."

Vista Manor is in a great location, the house is clean and you are made to feel very much at home. Fruit bowls for guests, freshly baked bread and outdoor dining were just a few of things that made this such a wonderful stay. Nothing is too much trouble. Would definitely stay here again<br/>Sharon and Chris <br/>Bermuda"

Elizabeth provided a wealth of amenities - more then I have ever seen anywhere - on top of having an amazing and beautiful house and land space. Elizabeth herself was a very gracious and giving host. Highly highly recommend this space!

I traveled with my mom, and my mom loved the little details in the room including the elephant themes and all the nice little attention to detail like the book of local restaurants which came in handy for finding breakfast the next day. I kinda wish I stayed longer, however Elizabeth is definitely great with her AirBnB! Thank you Elizabeth!"

It is exactly as advertised and so conveniently located just off Commercial, yet at the same time it's so quiet and peaceful that it feels like you're in a country house. Self check in was easy, and everything was clean and cute. We appreciate all the extras, like yogurt, bottled water, and yummy snacks in the room. Elizabeth is very kind, and she responds to emails right away. The first time we stayed we had a chance to meet her, and she introduced us to some adorable ducks in the backyard. :) The second time she was out of town, but available by text and email with quick responses. I definitely recommend this one - in fact, we are staying here again next month!"

20231503,486318612009316597,2021-11-01,5503965,Randall And Selina,"This place was more magical than we imagined. We stayed on Halloween night and the decorations inside and out made it atmospheric. It was easy to find, right off the main road (but couldn’t hear any traffic) and full of charm. We only stayed for one night but wished we had for more. We brought our dog and he made himself right at home. There was even a large park about 2 blocks away for us to walk him. We’d highly recommend this place!"
20231503,486975234767917575,2021-11-02,118109304,Lorie,Nice property!

It's my Salem pied-à-terre!
20231503,488406218885670946,2021-11-04,216483095,Jennie,"Elizabeth and her daughter make a strong effort to make your stay a nice one. They were helpful and generous with their hospitality. The room was well equipped with a fun elephant theme. Good bed, good rest."

20231503,497177782937888366,2021-11-16,374219209,Jennifer,I’ve now officially stayed in all 4 rooms in the main house. The butterfly room is lovely and well appointed. It seems like it lacks a mirror but it is in the wardrobe door. The bathroom is downstairs so that is the only small inconvenience but the bathroom is large and all yours. Lots of windows so it’s a nice bright space.
20231503,497926135325669823,2021-11-17,155943111,Audrey,"What a fabulous and affordable find!!! The house is beautiful, easy to check in and find, and the room we had was so cozy! Elizabeth thought of everything-mini fridge, coffee maker, dish ware, microwave, just about any toiletries you could think of, and snacks! It’s a beautiful home, and our room was just lovely. The bed was incredibly comfortable. The house was very quiet. Elizabeth made herself incredibly available. Best air bnb I’ve ever stayed. Definitely would go back, and definitely recommend!"
20231503,502977899918918555,2021-11-24,328821250,Krista,This place is even more charming and inviting than the listing shows. The host goes out of her way with extra touches of hospitality such as fresh baked banana bread and every kind of toiletry you could need. I’m already looking forward to a return trip to Salem to stay at this location.
20231503,505195278947431176,2021-11-27,427072580,Todd,"Elizabeth was incredibly gracious.   The accommodation was superior in every regard.   We loved the bed, the little extras (e.g. banana bread, cookies and in-room goodies, the toothpaste [in case you forgot], etc.), and the home itself (built in 1933) is so much fun that it was a pleasure to stay there.   If you visit Salem, OR you most definitely want to stay here."
20231503,510924727483056580,2021-12-05,36434748,Judith,This is my third time staying at Vista Manor and as always it was such a pleasure! Elizabeth goes above and beyond for her guests! And yetI have privacy! I look forward to the little extras that you don’t get in many other places. Things like snacks and yogurt and water and fruit and homemade banana bread! I will always stay at Vista Manor when in Salem!

20231503,529827563834645882,2021-12-31,84329701,Carolina,"Very convenient location as it has many options nearby and also to travel out too. Host is very nice, communicates well. Detailed in the extras she provided and if you are new to the area really recommend reading the binder for food, entertainment, and other recommendations.<br/><br/>Only minor complain we had is that the bed in the elephant room was a bit noisy. But Elizabeth said is going to have someone take a look at it to fix the issue. <br/><br/>Would definitely recommend this place :)"

Snacks and coffee, clean room, easy to get in and out - it was very nice. I felt very safe as a solo female traveler.  I also greatly appreciate the little welcome basket for my pup.  So much thoughtfulness.  <br/><br/>The only minor thing for me is that I didn’t realize there would be other guests.  This is more like a bed and breakfast, imo.  I could hear their conversations through the walls.  When they got up early, it woke me between their talking and walking through the hallway and down the stairs.  Light sleepers might want to bring earplugs."

20231503,637744476594076409,2022-05-29,3301961,Wendy,"We had a great stay at Elizabeth's home in Salem, Oregon. The house is set up to meet any of your needs. She has thought of everything. We loved the homemade bakery in the morning along with fresh fruit. We enjoyed the good coffee and creamer provided. The Elephant room had lovely unique decor and the space was calm and relaxing. <br/>We were close enough to walk to a few stories, which we always appreciate. The check-in system was easy. <br/>We will stay here again when we come to Salem. <br/>Oh, and very very quiet, we slept with the window open and didn't hear a thing. Also, sometimes shared spaces in a home can be nice, it felt like we were the only ones there.  This time of year it was too cool and rainy to enjoy the outdoor area by the pool, but it appears to be a well set up space when the sunshine shines."

20231503,652988721684668723,2022-06-19,453527233,Karen,"We stayed in the Elephant Room. Loved the decor-felt very comfortable there. Nice to have a bathroom, mini fridge, and microwave in the room. Wonderful home and grounds. Felt secluded but near our events and everything else we needed. Looked in the other rooms and they looked nice, too. We would stay here again if ever coming back to Salem, Oregon!"
20231503,663167408592179244,2022-07-03,123594,Lesa,"Always woke up to fresh baked goods and bottles of water and fresh fruit. Very nice very nice! It was a very quiet room I may have been the loudest person (sorry) there because I would come home at 10:30 after being with my grand baby. I apologize if I left the TV on and disturbed anyone I try to keep the volume to  a 2,3 or 4. Everyone I met at the house was very cordial and accommodating. I hope to come back soon and I will bring an elephant with me  to add to the collection the next time. I will be back. Thank you for sharing your lovely home."

It is so handy to have coffee and tea making available in the room as well as the microwave and fridge.  The little touches like fresh fruit,  muffins, silverware and plates make  all the difference.  The beds are very comfortable, the towels are soft and she even provides  fluffy bathrobes!  Better than a four star hotel in my opinion.  I look forward to staying again in the future."
20231503,697864710454868993,2022-08-20,9926421,Debbi,"The Elephant Room at Elizabeth’s AirBnB far exceeded our expectations. This is the first time I have stayed in a room in a home and it was everything and more that was described. The room was cozy, the bed very comfortable, the AC perfect and the vibe very welcoming. The Elephant Room is one of 4 on the 2nd floor that are AirBnB rentals. Despite all rooms being occupied the night we were there, it was quiet and safe. We also enjoyed access to a large living room, ample dining room and relaxing patio (complete with friendly kitty). Our every need was considered and filled. The location is also fabulous as it is a short walk to a number of good restaurants. We left wishing we had one more night there, we enjoyed it so much! We will definitely return if we ever are needing a place to stay in the Salem area."

The bed was very comfy and she has thought of everything! I even sent the listing to my mom for when she drives up from CA to visit as a good option for stopping half way.
20231503,715300841587032972,2022-09-13,17210498,Deborah,This lovely house with tastefully decorated private guest room and bath was a perfect place to spend the night in Salem. The Elephant Room was a gem. Highly recommend.

The bed was big and comfortable and the bathroom was very comfortable as well with a single sink. Loved the view of the pool from our room. There were fresh baked goods left in the hallway for all the guests to enjoy as well as fruit and other snacks. I'd never been in such a thought out Airbnb before.  Just loved it."

Her 1930s Tudor home is unique and interesting -- not to mention cozy and comfortable. And, her rates are unbeatable. If we need overnight lodging again in Salem, Vista Manor will be our first choice."

20231503,729741395318795603,2022-10-03,423566693,Paul,As nice as always.  Loved the king-sized bed in the Elephant Room. You make it feel like our home away from home.
20231503,732744324043121296,2022-10-07,68458671,Alex,"low quality in a fancy environment.  cleanliness and value get low marks: found several hairs in the bathroom upon entering. so much money for a creaky old room with waaaay too many elephant knick-knacks.  other guests were a pain, while posting did say “several” rooms are rented, they fail to include that all of those rooms - at least 4 - are on the same floor, and you will likely share 1-2 walls with them. the noise was insufferable: guests cooking meat in their rooms at 11pm, toilet seats falling at 6am, plastic trays/trash cans falling at 4am, trash collection/garbage trucks early in the AM, and next to two busy streets, not to mention you can hear everything, since it’s a creaky old house and you share the same floor/walls as everyone else.  Bed was comfy enough, but the pillows were low quality- are they original to the house?!?  internet couldn’t handle a podcast, so don’t count on that either.<br/>  i don’t think any consideration is paid to the guest experience. hosts do not put themselves in the guests shoes (apparently the parking rules only apply to guests, hosts can park anywhere and block your travel). i found this place to be all about ‘the house’ - which, sure is old and has a history - but the rooms are not worth the cost, not by a long shot!"
20231503,734146347622961782,2022-10-09,353477489,Karen,This is my second stay with Elizabeth. She makes everything so easy and welcoming. The rooms are fun and cozy and I sleep so well here! Highly recommend Vista Manor!

20231503,819638515181060473,2023-02-04,290408419,Warren,We stayed in room 2  aka The Elephant room.  Very cosy all the amenities you could want.   Will stay again.   Only note is to understand this is a heritage house with old doors and thin walls.  We could hear the young girls across the hall having a good giggle but not past 10pm.
20231503,821138426162915353,2023-02-06,133133,Shilei,"Felt like being home. The house is beautiful, and the anything we could have needed was provided. We were so comfy, we forgot to leave! <br/><br/>Thank you for hosting us 😊"

20232827,205270565,2017-10-21,141414780,Melanie,"We highly recommend this house and Ligali was an amazing host! He and his family were so helpful, giving local tips and also affording us total privacy. They are really friendly and genuinely kind people. The house was stocked with supplies, everything we needed, including nice appliances- gas stove, a mixer, Keurig, down to the details of tupperware and laundry soap. The deck in the backyard is a peaceful place to sit and relax- with some of those big trees that makes Oregon so nice. The air conditioning was excellent when it was hot. The house is roomy, beds are comfortable, internet fast, and tv nice. The location is nice and it is close to all kinds of stores, the only downside being a little traffic noise. We loved visiting Silver Falls, Lincoln City, Newport, Portland, and Eugene conveniently from Salem. This house was a perfect fit and we felt welcome and at home here. We really appreciated the hospitality and enjoyed our stay."
20232827,208266888,2017-10-31,115597323,Suzanne,"Ligali’s home was exceptionally clean, conveniently located in South Salem (close to my new favorite ice cream shop) and a more comfortable alternative to a local hotel. The home has been remodeled with modern features and has a large backyard and deck. Ligali was very accommodating and was quick to reply via text. I recommend this home for your family."
20232827,209952104,2017-11-06,31968276,Julie,"This is a lovely designed, renovated ranch style home that provides nice sized bedrooms and spacious bathrooms. The laundry area was handy and the kitchen was equipped with top of the line appliances. We missed having some basic condiments, but there was a nice spice rack. Pots and pans are provided, though they are difficult to access in an out of a corner lazy-susan. If you want wine, bring a corkscrew as we weren't able to find one. Keurig coffee pods and creamer was provided and of course appreciated. The mattress, pillows and bedding were delightful...super comfortable and cozy. The street is not super busy but cars did speed along and with the house sitting fairly close to the street, we needed to keep close eye on the two-year old. There was some road noise from the bedrooms but it settled down fairly early each evening."
20232827,212205506,2017-11-16,74058270,Michele,Pictures are accurate. Very comfortable and reasonably priced. Ligali was very prompt with any questions.

There is a beautiful full kitchen, pods coffee maker, toaster and pretty much anything you might need as well as a washer & dryer - perfect for a few days or longer stay.

20232827,214828746,2017-11-26,111326284,Bradley,"Excellent hosts.  Very thoughtful and easy to communicate with.<br/><br/>The house was perfect for our family of 6.  We stayed over the Thanksgiving holiday.  Kitchen was well stocked and had many great appliances pots & pans and utensils.  If you plan to do a lot of cooking as we did, you will need some extra items like cookie sheets, pie plates or baking dishes.<br/><br/>Beds and furniture were all very comfortable.  House was very clean.  Nice Roku TV with lots of streaming channels.<br/><br/>Convenient location close to many stores and restaurants.  <br/><br/>Great place to celebrate the holiday and felt like a home away from home."

His place is well-stocked with everything a person could want (coffee, oatmeal, granola bars, ice packs), but still it was clutter-free, spacious, and inviting. We walked up the street late our last night there for some great Thai food. Thank you so much! I hope to stay with you again! :) :)"

All the other spaces in the home were also perfect. Ligali was responsive and accommodating. We would love to stay here again on our future trips to Salem and we would highly recommend Ligali's home.
20232827,250594865,2018-04-05,168754844,Michael,"This is THE place for anyone looking for a comfortable, ""like home"" place to stay! Many ammenities included like soap and shampoo, towels, bedding, and even coffee! Spent a week with the family here and could not have asked for anything more! Great house to stay at if visiting Salem!"
20232827,251837483,2018-04-08,89910002,Nick,Perfect place to stay! Very clean. Responsive host. Highly recommended and worth the price.
20232827,262705564,2018-05-09,168793493,Wendy,"It was a very homey place with new renovations but a nice touch of the original house.<br/>It was great for the price when you have a family of six because it came out a lot cheaper then hotel rooms for us & our older married children.<br/>Communication was good but it is a busy street so night time was a little noisey on the weekend but tolerable.<br/>There are a lot of food items there which was nice to have available.<br/>For us the unfortunate part was the previous guest smoked in the house! That was not Ligali's fault and he did let us know before we checked in.  It was airing out when we arrived which helped a lot but every time we closed up and left, it still smelled a little smokey when we got back so we had to air out every time.  If airbnb guests want to smoke than they should look for those units available instead of ruining it for the next guest.  We enjoyed our stay a lot!"
20232827,264786670,2018-05-14,127375081,Linda,This was a spacious home for 6 guests. We enjoyed our stay immensely. It was in a good location for getting to central Salem. The house was appointed with nice things like a Keurig.
20232827,266900257,2018-05-20,45112427,Jami,"Our family really enjoyed staying in such an inviting and comfortable home.

20232827,336838387,2018-10-14,71732712,David,I would highly recommend Ligali's AirBnB. The house was clean and very well maintained. Location was quiet. The outdoor area looked very nice. Unfortunately it was a little too cold for us to enjoy it.
20232827,344514525,2018-11-03,137526104,Jake,"Ligali's home was exactly what I needed, a good clean home with everything I needed for a few days away from life's troubles. Close to food, but also secluded enough to feel like a quiet home. A+++"
20232827,352080427,2018-11-24,7268,Marcy + Niels,"We stayed with my senior dad and our twin one year olds. It's a multigenerational-friendly home. The only steps were at the front door, and it was just a couple. Sensored nightlights in the hall and rooms and few loose items for toddlers to terrorize.<br/><br/>Ligali's place was super clean, spotless and pretty comfortable and uncluttered. Easily accessed without having to communicate with the owner. The home was warned up already when we arrived. It felt thoughtful and like it was arranged for guests instead of feeling like you were staying in someone else's personal home. Quiet at night and squirrels to watch in the backyard.<br/>Two bathrooms and the full kitchen was nice. Once we opened all the curtains and let the daylight in, it felt bigger and even more welcoming."
20232827,357270790,2018-12-09,89910002,Nick,"Really great place to stay: convenient, clean, & quiet! I have stayed in this location multiple times now and will certainly stay again. Very responsive and easy to deal with hosts."

20232827,363865183,2018-12-29,58202916,Brenda,"Our family had a wonderful holiday week at Ligali’s place.  It was every bit as nice in real life as in photos on the internet.  The living areas were spacious and we enjoyed meals around the big dining table and played games and watched TV/movies in the living room.  The kitchen is gorgeously redone and extremely well equipped which was a treat for me so I could cook family holiday meals.  The location is quite nice in South Salem - close to downtown,  groceries, the post office, the bank - everything.  Ligali was very helpful with arrangements and always answered my questions quickly.  The beds were very comfortable with lovely linens.  Having two bathrooms was a big plus for a family gathering.  We hope to stay here again when we visit Salem."
20232827,401497739,2019-01-14,205235356,Joseph,"Everything was perfect. Very clean home with plenty of amenities. Very close to local businesses i.e. grocery stores, gas stations. I am definitely looking forward to staying here in the future."

20232827,450564716,2019-05-09,143169792,Kris,"This house was great for us!  Convenient location, quiet neighborhood.  Since a couple of us had bad knees, it was particularly comfortable, since it was all on one floor and the entrance only had a couple of shallow steps.  The kitchen was a delight to use - modern appliances.  The walk-in shower in the utility room was an added bonus!  The main bathroom had plenty of storage for our personal supplies.  The living room was comfortable for us to sit around and talk.  The host was particularly responsive when we had a problem with a kitchen shelf being loose.  I felt it was a comfortable place for a few days.  Since the weather was perfect, we enjoyed sitting on the back deck.  The back yard was private, which was nice."
20232827,452175394,2019-05-12,147109828,Susan,I very clean beautifully furnished home with air conditioning very comfortable beds and very nice amenities.  I highly recommend staying at Ligali's house!

Thoughtful kitchen touches include an electric tea kettle, large toaster, Keurig, coffee pods, tea, hot cocoa, granola bars, fruit chews, full spice rack. There were ice packs in the freezer which we used to pack our picnic. Nest thermostat provided air conditioned comfort and Ring doorbell provided security. Thick, soft towels were provided and the linens were soft, not scratchy. We would definitely stay again when in the Salem area! Thank you for a wonderful stay, Ligali!"

The house was clean,  quiet;  the beds were comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked with coffee and snacks. Ligali let me know when the cleaners were done so that we could check in before 5 which we appreciated. Several great restaurants are very close by. The Neighborhood was quiet so we all slept well. I would recommend this house and would stay here again."

Situated in a peaceful area, it's  close to shops, restaurants, supermarkets etc. Great size backgarden which we loved for chilling out, plenty of room for the kids to run around and play. Handy with decking area and BBQ. Place was spotless, so clean and the amenities were great! <br/>Ligali was really helpful and made sure to message to see if there was anything we needed and was very quick to respond if we semt a message. <br/>Would definitely recommend.<br/>Thanks for a great stay and we will be back! :)"

20232827,652489278,2020-08-16,181435923,Fabiola,"I wasn't happy with this place. When we walked in the house, had an awful smell. We had to drive to the store to buy Febreeze to spray the whole house. I wasn't able to cook, the pans were dirty and smelled bad. The knifes were oxided or dirty. The shower curtain had pink slime. One of the bed covers had a stain.<br/>One of the bathrooms did not have shampoo and conditioner and I had to go out and buy some, which it was another expense.<br/>The TV, wasn’t working properly and the internet kept turning off and on.<br/><br/>Overall, staying at this place caused an extra expense for my family to eat out instead of cooking as I planned to and wasn’t able to due to dirty and smelly pans."

20232827,673022491,2020-10-10,365818287,Nicole,This home was immaculate and very family friendly.  We loved being able to visit Silver Falls State Park from here.  We were a little surprised to see that they request shoe not be worn in the house.  This was hard on our feet after hiking most of the day.  You may want to bring a pair of slippers if you're not used to being on hardwood floors all the time.  We loved having a full kitchen and plenty of space for our entire family.

The house is on an arterial road but noise was not an issue, and the location made it really easy to get out to all of the places that we needed to be. There are tons of close options for food and beverages. Air conditioning was great, very large backyard, and an enjoyable stay. I would recommend this home and would absolutely stay here again!"

Every kitchen item we could need to serve our own meals were provided as well as 3 different coffee makers. That was a new one for us. The home was spotless and had upgrades we weren’t expecting. Ligali was the perfect host and we hope to be using this home on our future visits to Salem.

Kitchen was functional and stocked except for salt/pepper. Large frig was a plus for us since we stayed for a week. The only detractor was the traffic noise coming from the road that was pretty constant. This was a busy road near an elementary school. If you're not bothered by road noise, we'd highly recommend Ligali's place. This was the reason it didn't get 5 stars for location."

The home was close to our family and all the locations we had to be. The communication was great and the self check-in was very simple. The home was very well decorated and stocked with essentials. I know I’ll be back here in a few months when I visit family again.
20232827,592098939734569644,2022-03-27,60838668,Maggie,We stayed for a weekend. The host's communication was wonderful. I had a few issues and they responded right away and fixed it. I lost a ring and the host took the time to go look for it. That meant a lot. It is on a busy road as others have stated but I couldn't hear any noise when I was sleeping. It was comfortable for a weekend stay.

I like to cook and the kitchen is complete with all of the standard kitchen tools that you might need. They even have spices and cooking oil in stock. We just used some and replaced them. We also enjoyed Keurig coffee. The home is secure with Ring lock. My daughter loved the spacious backyard once it stopped raining. Our check-in was seamless. The guests instructions and house rules were very clear. Ligali is very responsive to queries. There’s a washer and dryer for your dirty clothes. There are cleaning supplies to tidy up the place and extra toilet paper and paper towels. It was such a homey stay. Quiet neighborhood and restaurants and coffee shops are close by. Very good deal and excellent stay overall. Definitely recommend! We will book again in our next visit to Salem. Thank you, Ligali. God bless you and your family."

It was perfect for our large family group, plenty of open space to gather, yet still able to find a quiet corner if needed.<br/>Sheli is quick to respond and so accommodating.  We traveled with a toddler and Sheli offered everything needed, a highchair, play-n-pack, toys, even chubby books! <br/>I would rebook in a heartbeat without a second thought.  The only disappointment? It was over way to fast!!<br/>"

Home is well laid out with little details to make a stay away from home comfortable and enjoyable.   Home is in a nice, quiet, safe neighborhood.

20329904,595687946,2020-01-20,153521418,Nick,Had a great stay at this home. We were in the area for a basketball tournament and the stay was made so easy here. The kids loved the entertainment room but especially the ping pong table! If we ever come back to Salem for a tournament this is gonna be my first choice to stay.
20329904,640248460,2020-07-19,355096671,Les,"Great 2 story home.  Very clean and spacious.  Our softball team stayed here for a tournament,  and with 10 people there was room to spare.  Highly recommend this rental.  We will try to book it again next time we play in Salem."

The kitchen has all the comforts of home with the breville coffee and a vitamix. The kids loved the gameroom. The layout of the home is nice many together spaces yet you could still enjoy a nap in the bedrooms undisturbed.  Shelli even set out baby monitors, highchair and a play pen to make our time together with the babes safe and relaxing. Thank you again for your hospitality.  <br/>Sincerely, <br/>Rebekah Doyle"
20329904,415929365427840177,2021-07-27,294770373,Holly,"Sheli’s home is located in a well maintained, quiet neighborhood with yummy wild blackberries growing across the street. We used this as a home base for out of town family attending our daughters wedding in July.  The home is set up with everything you’ll need plus more with personal touches throughout that make you feel at home. The few days after wedding we spent relaxing out on deck enjoying the views of very well maintained garden on comfortable “like new” outdoor furniture feeling like we’re at a 5-star resort. We would highly recommend!"
20329904,429024552117597289,2021-08-14,93899786,Rosie,This place was absolutely amazing. All our family fit comfortably and it was so cozy. The kitchen had everything we needed to make the large breakfasts we needed. The neighborhood was definitely quite and being at the end of the cul-de-sac reduced any street noise. I just can’t say enough good things about this place. Anyone with a large family or just needs space should definitely stay here.

The kids loved all the toys they discovered at the house and we definitely appreciated the pack and play that Sheli left out for us. I would suggest for anyone bringing littles to bring a baby gate for the top of the stairs. The only complaint that I have is that there were no bath washcloths in the house but other than that it was a great stay.

20329904,663107210986939060,2022-07-03,378307769,Don,Poor communication skills. Last minute checkout due to miss understanding. Take before and after videos and picture because the house is still full of owner belongings in the cabinet in case anything goes missing.  Don’t feel like an Airbnb. Ruin my family reunion due to a misunderstanding and a last minute checkout. Don’t even wanna give us time to pack up. Everything was a last minute.
20329904,668878176413606874,2022-07-11,34069570,Tatiana,Great house and location.  Everyone love the patio. The espresso machine was a huge hit!    Sheli was a wonderful host and communicated well.   My friends and I were there for a race.   We would definitely go back

There are fantastic amenities such as the fire pit table outside and a breville expresso maker in the kitchen. We also made use of the kids toys for our toddlers and the many rooms for our extended families to sleep in.

After checkin (even though it wasn't advertised), she prepared a lovely dinner and breakfast for us.  My room was large and clean and comfortable, with a king size bed, desk, wifi, and towels.  The shared bathroom was also large and clean and came with shampoo, conditioner and body wash.  Didn't get to use it, but there was also a nice looking pool!"

She was quick to respond to my questions and before meeting her I felt welcomed which was important for my long term stay as a guest who has never been to Oregon before.

She has welcomed me to family get togethers and dinners and I feel like part of the family. Her home offers more than just a room, but a great experience:) Highly recommend!"

The room was large and comfortable, and well stocked with all kinds of thoughtful little extras. The bathroom being downstairs really isn't a big deal unless you're faced with mobility issues. The rooms are by no means soundproof, but the other guests were quiet and respectful for the most part when I was there. Elizabeth was a responsive host and a pleasure to book with, answered all of my questions and I have no doubt she would be attentive to any needs that may come up. While this is a pet friendly BnB, the yard is home to chickens ducks and a rabbit so probably not the best place to relieve a dog. Elizabeth did point us to a nearby park, though, that was a nice place to walk them. Would absolutely book this room again!"
20555651,534886379240723385,2022-01-07,254486625,Jim,"The home made pastry snacks are very yummy, different each time."

Elizabeth is kind, caring thoughtful and her Manor is very accommodating. She and her staff are very helpful. <br/>I stayed there for almost month and would so again if ever needed."

20555651,553731944831356290,2022-02-02,110358228,Misa Misa Amani,"my goodness! the reviews pretty much nail this one on the head. not quite sound proof but that is never a problem for me but may be for others. The home is so clean, beautiful and packed with anything you would need. only thing I didn't see coming is not having access to the kitchen but if you don't bring a bunch of foods to cook on an oven top and bring things like frozen pizzas, packaged oatmeal, or box/microwavable hot cereals, etc you'll find she has everything you need to prepare it. and you can pair it with any baked goods she makes and keep well stocked. in fact everything is well stocked. location is amazing and close to everything you need. love the bath downstairs! big tub for bath lovers. and a heater inside to keepthe space warm for you when you get out. the house is so big and beautiful and she's a great host. very polite and quick to respond to any concerns or questions. would recommend 10/10"

The house has a B and B vibe and feel and we felt really comfy. Our host, Elizabeth, is a lovely woman and an outstanding host. She's very attentive to her guests and so easy to communicate with. Should we ever need a nice, clean place to stay at while here in Salem, this will be the first place we check."

Everything was so clean, Elizabeth was super friendly, and the house and grounds were pretty. :) We loved having the mini fridge and microwave! Only thing is sound - you can definitely hear the people (and their phones) in the room next to you. Didn't bother us though, everyone was respectful!"

20555651,582635569563158707,2022-03-14,11766667,Lea,"Elizabeth provides a wonderful experience in her lovely home. We stayed in the Butterfly room and it was full of charm. As soon as we stepped into the home it felt like we stepped back in time. The bathroom was clean, the room was clean and if felt welcoming as soon as we drove up the driveway.  <br/><br/>The room also came with a continental breakfast and coffee. The coffee was good especially with the loaf cake and fruit. The bathroom had thick fluffy towels which made the ABnB feel like home. The bed is comfortable and with the butterfly artwork throughout the room it gave us the ability to lie back and relax. <br/><br/>We will definitely go back to experience the area of Salem in the Summer and stay at Vista Manor."

Walking distance from restaurants. built in pool and hot tub in the a beautiful backyard but could not enjoy since I was there in the off season. All the comforts of home. If you have cat or dog allergies this may not  be the home for you although I never saw the cats or dog but I could smell them.

Even though my stay was short, it was perfect! Such a comfortable bed and room. Really made me feel at peace during my stay. If only I could stay here during the summer! I got a sneak peek of the backyard and was tempted to dip into the pool! (:<br/>If you are passing through Salem, I HIGHLY recommend staying here. Elizabeth was quite the accommodating host and the place itself felt so magical. I’m hoping to book a stay here again soon!"
20555651,600030672377849787,2022-04-07,447958581,Rodney,We loved our stay. It was close to everything yet set back on a nice acre lot of peace and privacy.  The host was wonderful.  We would definitely come again if we can find a vacancy.

20555651,602987270050885355,2022-04-11,196080460,Stephanie,Elizabeth really makes sure you have what you need. She was a very clear and prompt communicator as well. Loved the room themes and nostalgia of a 1930’s home. Glad I had the opportunity to stay here!

We could not believe all the treats and goodies that were offered by the host without any extra charge. If we will ever be in this area again, we will book this place and only this place again! The front yard was covered in several hundred tulips. WE LOVED IT!!! Thank you so much!"

The bathroom being downstairs wasn't a problem but we did get a bit self conscious we would wake up other guests if we had to use the restroom at night. Very clean, and the host is very thoughtful! Will be staying here again"

20555651,637786246574320032,2022-05-29,79036906,Joan,"This is a quaint, old BnB which has its charm. Elizabeth equips you with many thoughtful touches in terms of snacks and amenities. We were grateful for our “white noise” machine because with 4 rooms close together, old doors and uncarpeted stairs, there is a certain amount of noise from other rooms. Charming place and area… great value!"
20555651,638419131722755419,2022-05-30,460725963,Eric,"Very nice room, comfortable bed, everything was very clean and well organized. Host was friendly and communicative. Highly recommended."

Her home is so special with so many sweet details, from the decor to the water and fruits left out for guests. Highly recommend!"
20555651,642117250365681315,2022-06-04,68419468,Candi,"I saw two of Elizabeth's rooms. The first was after she accepted my reservation and placed me into this beautiful en-suite and grand room with a beautiful king bed,  lovely bathroom, in room m/w, fridge/coffee maker/fruit/snacks etc and a large closet with an additional bed. I had laid out my belongings, prepared the bed for sleep, made the bath ready for a long needed soak after driving from Connecticut over the course of 4 days (almost 3600 miles!), and was just getting ready to disrobe in the bathroom when Elizabeth knocked on the door, came in and told me I had to move to the other room because someone else had just reserved it in the last 5 minutes and were on their way! Of course, as a super host myself, I knew she had to accept the reservation, send the party her address and that the folks could not have just shown up without her express permission, so her excuse was not an honest one.  She then came in and started gathering my stuff to move me into the second room. The 2nd room was 1/3 the size and the bath was on the first floor (room was on the second floor). The coffee maker was ancient and leaked all over when I tried to use it the next day.  The room was nice, the bed was comfortable and I was too completely exhauseted to argue. She kept saying ""I tried to do a nice thing"", but the truth is that she wanted to get more money and had no qualms booting me and my things out of the first room into the second and lying about it. Having explained that, the big room is lovely and worth every penny. The butterfly (second room) is tiny (but had a big TV/fan/lovely windows) and there is little room to move around, but the bed is very comfortable. It is a bit of hassle to go down the stairs in the middle of the night if you have to use the ladies room and might not work well if you do not want to run up the stairs after a bath/shower in a robe, have kids or any problems going up and downstairs.  Could have been the best stay ever, ended up being OK."
20638909,252476941,2018-04-10,12934488,Patrick,Great location right on Mill Creek.  Historic and very cute home.  Close to town and walkable to downtown if you don’t mind about a 1 mile walk.  We very much enjoyed our stay here.
20638909,257883532,2018-04-27,39360983,Benjamin,"Really beautiful, recently updated historic home. House is extremely clean and well appointed throughout. Back patio has a BBQ (which we did not use). Would be a great place to hang out, eat, BBQ right on the river. Didn't spend much time in the house (at a training all week), but seemed very cozy."

20638909,545013235641993313,2022-01-21,164212788,Morgann,"Beautiful house! Very clean! Our only feedback to improve would be that the house decor is not very kid friendly with lots of extra decorations everywhere, glass furniture and no option for a high chair.  It felt a bit tight navigating around everything with a child. We could not get the tv to work even by following the host directions. <br/>But the location is great with a clean, small park 800 ft away that has a good playground."
20638909,653743021729839784,2022-06-20,150156861,Destiney,"This is such a beautiful home. We loved our time here. The creek is beautiful, but definitely watch pets and little ones like the listing says. The home is so lovely with gorgeous views and great ambiance. It had everything we needed and more. Would definitely stay here again."

20769206,311671423,2018-08-21,15107899,Tyler,"Evelyn was just great. She was very accommodating on check in and check out. She would always respond in a timely manner. You have a private room in the basement. Evelyn’s sister also lives in the basement but has her half blocked off and keeps to herself so don’t let that worry you. Evelyn also has some oatmeal packets, Keurig cups for coffee, and tea packets. She has all of the basic ammentities (towels, sheets, soap, shampoo, etc) and even has a small fan and mini space heater. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable place close to town. Thanks again Evelyn!"

The room is clean, bed is super comfortable, loved the rocker/ottoman and the amenities like a Kuerig coffee maker, private frig and microwave. Desk and tv in room with Netflix also make for a very pleasant stay. Evelyn is a quiet and very nice lady."
20769206,344505943,2018-11-03,56650358,Martha,This was a quiet and comfortable room to stay in with nice amenities such as a microwave and keurig. The shared bathroom was never an issue and when I needed to use the kitchen it was available. Evelyn was very nice upon meeting and throughout my stay.
20769206,348092832,2018-11-12,66780510,Nicholas,"Evelyn was an accommodating host who stayed up late into the night to receive me after I flew into Portland. Her home is located in a quiet part of town, but it’s also just a few minutes away from downtown, good food and the state Capitol. The bed was comfortable and the room was well kept. If I find myself in Salem again I’ll be staying here again."
20769206,446104201,2019-04-30,111335639,Michelle,"You can expect a quiet, clean space with a gorgeous backyard. The location was absolutely amazing, on a quiet street with an entire walking track located across the street. It was everything I needed."
20769206,511723381,2019-08-17,28563622,Francesco,"Amazing house,beautiful garden and Evelyn is really sweet!Thanks again!"
20769206,559298118,2019-11-03,156217079,Daniel,"This was a stellar place to stay. Evelyn was deeply hospitable and provided a phenomenal place to stay for two months. The room and common area were clean, spacious, and well-supplied. Its proximity to multiple bus routes makes the location ideal for anyone wanting to explore the area, and there's a lot right nearby the house. Evelyn always respected guests' privacy and was always there to provide any information and good conversation. I will greatly miss being there and will be sure to return whenever I revisit the area!"
20769206,562403674,2019-11-10,43136997,Jillian,"Evelyn and her cohost were so sweet. Only saw each of them once or twice during the 5 nights I stayed but they were very prompt to respond to messages if I needed anything. Very comfortable bed with plenty of blankets and pillows. The bathroom is shared but there was only one time it was occupied when I needed it :). I only saw the lady staying in the other room one time while making coffee in the Keurig, and the rooms don’t have shared walls. Excellent value and just what I was looking for. Would definitely stay again if I was in the area."
20769206,576187012,2019-12-12,304884450,Chloe,"Evelyn was so nice and accommodating. The downstairs area is very large and includes a kitchen area, dining area, washer and dryer, and bathroom. My room was great - probably the most comfortable bed that I've ever slept on. I was here for almost two weeks and really enjoyed my stay. Thank you Evelyn!"
20769206,607387263,2020-02-17,71479580,Tommy,"Amazing stay! Very clean space, quiet neighborhood, and very nice hosts! Highly recommend."
20769206,655688753,2020-08-23,360216079,Michael,"I was very fortunate to stumble upon this gem. While we are each unique  in our desires I would happily prefer staying at Evelyn's over the Plaza Hotel or the Breakers in Palm Beach. Why you may ask? Each turn of a towel, folded sheet or fluffed pillow is done with the type of care that only comes with proprietorship. While a rating of AAAAA may ensure it's all booked up and I'll never get to stay again it certainly deserves it. What a treat!"
20769206,748021444,2021-04-11,330207981,David,"The stay was spacious, quiet, and provided great amenities. Perfect place to relax and its location is close to good food. Evelyn was a wonderful host. She gave a clear introduction to the stay and was quick to respond to any questions."
20769206,749533036,2021-04-17,392699762,Taylor,Great host. Private room to myself. Will return if I'm ever in the area again.
20769206,826980199796710716,2023-02-14,471327349,James,Very pleasant place to stay. Would definitely return.
20843302,203267179,2017-10-14,7411713,Linda G.,"I highly recommend Don & Karen's home in south east Salem! They have gone more than the extra mile in making sure that their guests are comfortable! <br/><br/>I spent 3 weeks in their home. My room was very attractive and perfectly appointed with a comfortable bed and pillows, ample closet space, a chest of drawers and a desk which was perfect for my laptop. It also had a comfortable armchairs and plenty of pillows if I wanted to read in bed!  The bathroom was spacious and comfortable with a great shower/tub combo, immediate hot water and plenty of space for my personal items. The kitchen had everything I needed to cook my own meals. There is a Safeway and a Walmart 1/2 miles away. <br/><br/>Since I didn't have a car, the extra bonus for me was the bus stop for bus line #6 which was  2/10ths of a mile away. I frequently used it to go to my daughter's house.  Of alI the comforts in their home, I wasn't expecting to be so conveniently located to precisely the bus routes I needed to visit my daughter and to go downtown!  Bus line #21 gets you downtown in 20 minutes traveling all along Commercial St which is the main thoroughfare in southeast Salem. That stop is 1/2 a mile away. <br/><br/>Karen and Don are very thoughtful and ensured I had space in the pantry and a small fridge to store my food items. But best of all was their friendly and warm, easy-going hospitality! I highly recommend staying in their home in southeast Salem!"
20843302,237148557,2018-02-21,144155626,Dami,Don and Karen are one of the most amazing people I’ve ever met. This was my first AirBnB experience and they showed me first class hospitality. They went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and further helped me out with my accommodation needs. <br/>Wonderful hosts with a beautiful home that is about 5mins drive to almost everything you’ll need to be comfortable! I’m very happy with my experience. God bless!
20843302,258215919,2018-04-28,130778708,Shina,"Don and Karen are really nice hosts, great place to stay!"

20843302,323095794,2018-09-14,41396770,Thu,"Don and Karen were the best hosts I could've asked for during my 6 week stay. They were so accommodating with all my requests and made sure all of my questions were answered. The rooms have all you need, the bathroom is spacious, and the house is sparkling clean at all times. The house was always calm and relaxing, easy to come home to after a long day. Their dog is also such a sweetheart on top of it all. They basically became like family at the end of it all! Would definitely recommend anyone coming through Salem to stay here!"
20843302,443318175,2019-04-25,246859923,Rachel,"They’re really great people. They’re friendly, but they also give you space. They have the sweetest dog I have ever met!! They provide so many things, and they really go above and beyond!"
20843302,596101896,2020-01-21,69775262,Colin,"Don and Karen’s home was the perfect place for me to stay while travelling for work. The room was cozy and comfortable, the bathroom was always clean, I had my own fridge, and their dog is the absolute sweetest. They even invited me along to their holiday get togethers when I wasn’t able to travel home to see family."
20843302,620887551,2020-03-25,106394748,Rachel,"I stayed with Don and Karen for 2 months for a physical therapy school clinical rotation. It was a great stay! They were very friendly, hospitable, and welcoming. Their house is in a great location for commuting around the area- close to hikes, parks, local businesses, you name it. They would offer me tips and recommendations for things around the area which was very helpful. I was able to have my own space and be able to visit/interact as well. The house is always very clean and the room is a cool space with a desk for if you need to do work. I would join in on family Catan nights which was always fun. Highly recommend!"
20843302,734858665,2021-02-27,179587281,Blake,Don and Karen are amazing hosts! I would suggest this to any graduate student or travel nurse looking to stay in the area. The house and room are very welcoming and their dog is the best!
20843302,753721988,2021-05-01,94918852,Nicole,Don and Karen are great hosts. I would recommend this stay to any other students looking for a place for a rotation!
20843302,385544139391190058,2021-06-15,144679915,Cynthia,I am so thankful to have found this listing! It is what made my trip up to Oregon possible. The perfect spot for any student on clinical/travel nurse. The space is clean and I am so happy to have found a space where I feel safe. They’ve been so accommodating - even so far as making sure there’s enough room in the pantry and room for groceries.  10/10
20843302,594977381178479649,2022-03-31,259754462,Shannon,"I feel so lucky to have stumbled upon Don and Karen’s Airbnb for my long term stay while I finish up some schooling. It’s been a home away from home and I wouldn’t have wanted to stay anywhere else!  So many good conversations and laughs! Their dog, Zona, is the sweetest pup and is the cherry on top of a wonderful stay.<br/><br/>There’s been so many things that they’ve gone above on, but just to name a few: Don drove to help me fix a flat tire on a Saturday morning and then stayed with me when some men asked if I could jump their car; Karen drove me to Portland for a medical procedure and then stayed to drive me back to Salem; and Karen also got up at 3am to drive me to Portland for a 6am flight. They’re absolutely incredible and some of the best people you’ll meet!"
20843302,832843938118362465,2023-02-22,155809930,Monaisa,Awesome family and zona is a peach once she gets use to you .
22215712,221758837,2017-12-27,52899211,Duy-Khiem,"First and foremost, Emily and Ian are the nicest couple. They greeted us into their home and made us feel right at home. Not to be overlooked is their wonderfully decorated home with historical, cultural, and fun art pieces throughout; I found myself lost in the some pieces as I admired the artifacts. The accommodation exceeded our expectations in every way. We were only passing by for one night on our way home, but we would have loved to stay longer. Hopefully next time. Thanks for welcoming us into your lovely home and for a wonderful stay."

The bedroom/private bath were clean and stocked with toiletries for those who might forget them.  A large widescreen TV with streaming services was available as was the kitchen.  The location is convenient -- a quiet residential area just a couple minutes from all the stores.
22215712,226623603,2018-01-11,157344929,Jeffrey,Extremely welcoming hosts + clean spacious room and private restroom + thoughtful touches like extra toiletries for guests = perfect Airbnb.

Super cool! Although I'm allergic too cats I didn't have a problem sleeping in the guest room, and didn't need any medication. Room was super clean. As a guest here Ian, and Emily made me feel comfy. Definitely recommend them for any travel goers who are visiting for a week/weekend."

22215712,283866747,2018-06-30,5707629,Arlene & Jeff,Beautiful parrots and handsome Koi almost jumping out of their pond to eat. Their was a feeling of being in a tropical paradise. Although we were only there for one night. It would have been nice to relax on their padio. Plus we were surprised by a lovely breakfast.
22215712,285098359,2018-07-02,13772462,Pam,"Get place to stay, with my own bathroom too, not on-suite but close by. Love the artistic touch’s, fun color,  and sweet pets. I’ll be back here!"

22215712,287977895,2018-07-08,11277798,Elizabeth,The room in Emily’s Home is quaint. The bathroom was very clean and had extra touches like a travel toothbrush set just in case I forgot mine. She even had fresh flowers in my room. Would definitely stay here again.
22215712,288828303,2018-07-10,66576088,Sondra,"Emily & Ian are wonderful hosts & we thoroughly enjoyed our stay for 2 nights at their lovely home. Their home has lots of class & if you enjoy history, these folks are for you!  Emily is by far the hostess with the mostest,  &  went the extra mile in many ways. Our only regret is that we could not stay & enjoy their gardens longer."
22215712,289198798,2018-07-11,106178715,Laura,Emily's place was lovely! The bedroom and bathroom were clean & comfortable. The garden surrounding the house was beautiful!

22215712,290601565,2018-07-14,200606650,Mary,"Emily’s accommodations were perfect for our one-night in Salem while my daughter took her ACT test. It was nice to be able to relax on the back deck, watch the koi, listen to the tropical birds, and just enjoy the serene environment she has created in her home. "

22215712,292326979,2018-07-17,48151846,Thomas,Emilee and Ian are very kind and gracious hosts. My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay. We especially loved Firkin the kitty that talks to you when you say hi to him.  This is a very  peaceful atmosphere and a comfortable bed.   Would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Salem. Thank you so much Emilee and AN.

22215712,297962171,2018-07-28,141135904,Bill,"Very nice couple. Room and bathroom is very clean. I slept very well there.  Didn’t wake up once. I’m sensitive sometimes to animals and pollen but not here.  Super friendly cat, like their owners.  Very smart engaging conversation over coffee.  I was on business and would have like to stayed longer. "
22215712,301138785,2018-08-03,111485694,Minh,I would recommend her place to any one
22215712,304074790,2018-08-08,189609619,Ron,"A cozy room, a private bathroom, a charming couple, and a willingness to help make your Salem experience a winning one - high praise, but well-earned.  Emily and Ian made us feel at home from the moment we stepped in the door, as did their charming cat, Firkin.  You get way more than you pay for if you stay here, and we hope to return on a future visit."
22215712,305045514,2018-08-10,95561752,Kathryn & Andrew,"Comfortable bed in a dark room made for a good night's rest. The bathroom is very brightly painted and decorated, with a good shower, which made for a good start to my day! Emily and I shared a beer and a comedy show the night before."

22215712,308626053,2018-08-16,54284934,Nicole,"I've had a week to think about this review, and I'm still shaken by how I was treated. After checking in and being asked to store my suitcases in the kitchen (because they were too heavy for her new floors), I laid down on the bed to relax. Almost immediately I noticed several ants on the bed. After investigating, I found more ants on the floor, baseboards, walls, and getting into my bag of cookies. When I pointed them out trying to come to a resolution between us, Emily became enraged and said that I should call AirB&B to make other arrangements. As it was my first AirB&B stay, I didn't realize I could do that. She repeatedly yelled about my finding ""one teeny tiny ant"" (there were many ants) and sprayed bug spray around the room while I was in it. And she mentioned that other people had complained about ants and how she doesn't run a professional hotel with an exterminator. Then she told me to take my things and leave. I have never witnessed such behavior in my life, and I was horrified that I was in a strange city with no place to stay. Luckily AirB&B found a lovely place for me to stay less than a mile away and refunded all fees associated with my stay. I really think Emily needs to do more to get rid of the ants, but more importantly, she needs to learn how to keep her cool when things don't go right. I do not recommend her place."
22215712,309156536,2018-08-17,117186777,Jonathan,"Emily and Ian were such kind, warm hosts -- staying here was lovely. Lots of quirky little touches that really brought personality to the home. Everything was clean and neat, I would recommend staying here anytime!"

22215712,313039432,2018-08-24,20226383,Joe,Our stay at Emily’s was perfect for what we needed!  The bathroom and bedroom were really clean and use of the kitchen was really helpful for us.  Emily was very nice and welcoming willing to help in anyway she could.  We really liked their friendly cat :-)  The birds were really cool to see and the backyard was so nice!   Looks like they put a lot of work and care into the house!  
22215712,315009502,2018-08-27,195621034,John,Expect a quiet and very clean place. Come and go as you please also.

22215712,317828005,2018-09-02,69419821,Marisa,We had a short and sweet stop at Emily’s house on our way back from a wedding. It was lovely. Emily was very accommodating and the room was perfect for some quick shut eye before hitting the road again. Loved the vintage decor!
22215712,318519230,2018-09-03,38854760,Melanie,"Emily and Ian are great hosts with a fabulous Airbnb setup. The pictures do not do this room justice - it is extremely spacious (as is the bathroom)! I was only in Salem for the one night so I did not use the kitchen, which was available. <br/><br/>The bedroom and bathroom are all located on the main/first floor; however, there are stairs between the driveway and the front door (which I didn’t mind at all! but may be important to consider depending on a person’s ambulatory needs).<br/><br/>If I’m ever back in Salem, I would definitely see if this location is available again. Highly recommend!"
22215712,319549736,2018-09-06,2994905,Sandra,"Emily, Ian, and Firkin the cat were fantastic hosts! We were so glad to stay there overnight on our long road trip down the 5. The room is super spacious, Firkin the cat and all the animals were a wonderful distraction from the long day, and it was so nice to finish the day in a clean, orderly, and inviting home. I'm sure we would have enjoyed staying longer if we could have. I recommend it for anyone looking for a clean, cozy stay while either exploring the area (just a 10 minutes drive from downtown Salem), or simply stopping by for the night. Thank you for the great stay!"
22215712,321957969,2018-09-11,71009608,Bill,"Clean, easy access, good hospitality."
22215712,322650682,2018-09-13,25697299,Travis,"Emily and Ian were outstandingly gracious hosts, showing us around her beautiful and fascinating home and some fantastic local insight. The room and bathroom were spotless, and we slept great. Be sure to stop by Santiam Brewing if you're staying with them to try some of their amazing variety of beers. And if you are a bird lover, you're in for a special treat!"
22215712,323064807,2018-09-14,215264829,Jeannette,I st time staying;) Definitely will recommend Emily's place! We were lucky to find this place at short timing & a great rate. The family were very friendly & the place was decorated very beautiful with amenities;) the garden & fish pond out back was beautiful too;) What a pleasant day!
22215712,324302364,2018-09-16,52467477,Foogi & Diana,Emily’s place was clean and cozy. We stayed for one night but it felt like home. We will definitely stay again if we are in the area. They have cute cat :)
22215712,325816964,2018-09-20,147748125,Logan,"Great value and comfy room. B sure to remember the host has birds because they start chirping around 10am until 10pm, but otherwise are quiet-  Was a great place to stay overnight!"
22215712,326226081,2018-09-21,213249692,Lesa,Clean room and bathroom in a nice neighborhood!

22215712,329400602,2018-09-28,84171946,Richard,My stay at Emily's was great. She was very friendly and available if I needed anything. I was in town for work and it was in a great location for my commute as well as to stores and restaurants. The bed was comfortable and I plan to stay here again if I am back in the area.
22215712,331135291,2018-10-01,71408736,John,Come as a stranger and leaves as a friend. This is the most desirable and authentic experience a traveler could hope for. Emily is a rare diamond among a sea of zirconium. 5 starts.

22215712,340103846,2018-10-22,26875889,Kristina,Ian and Emily were such great host. I felt very comfortable in there home. Ian was so kind to include me for dinner the first night I was there. I had lovely conversations with Emily. I couldn’t have asked for a better spot. I loved all the birds and of course there cat Furkin. I would definitely stay here again if I’m ever in Salem.
22215712,341042864,2018-10-26,61133320,Justin,Had to cancel reservations but went smooth.

22215712,358042412,2018-12-12,227857763,Brad,"Nice hosts in a unique setting.  Hope you like birds, but they are not bothersome at night, at all, and I enjoyed them."
22215712,358259327,2018-12-13,33056813,Austin,Overall wonderful little room. Would recommend it for anyone need a place to stay in Salem for the night

22215712,361497909,2018-12-23,15387785,David,I used Emily's place as a pit stop on my way north. I had a pleasant stay - they have a very nice cat!
22215712,364936563,2018-12-31,226105057,Katie,"We were welcomed in and invited to watch tv with Emily. We were given plenty of privacy and space. While the birds made sure we didn’t sleep in too late, they were charming and never an issue. Great location, friendliness, and a relaxing place after our long excursions."
22215712,368705525,2019-01-07,206666001,Garth,"Ian and Emily are very nice hosts.  I enjoyed my stay at their house.  Very comfortable bed and stylish room.  I very much recommend staying here.  Close to shopping, but in a quite cul de sac."
22215712,400612119,2019-01-12,204623262,Dallas,Emily's was a great host for us. This is our first experience in an Airbnb and she was very lenient with us knowing that (we ended up staying till after 11am cause I didn't understand that there was a check out time). Her house is very unique and comforting and her parrots singing was entertaining. Thank you to Emily and Ian for a great first experience and for being understanding!
22215712,402537986,2019-01-18,4923578,Hannah,"Emily’s place was so lovely - I loved the bird themed decor, and her cat was the sweetest. I came in late and left early in the morning so I didn’t get to spend too much time, but I’d love to in the future."
22215712,402794956,2019-01-19,235497369,Connie,"The host, Emily, couldn't have been nicer, but it didn't make up for the uncomfortable weirdness. When I expressed unease at sleeping just feet from the bloody war print and actual weapons that were attached to the wall (an antique rifle and very sharp-looking spears and knives), Emily moved me to the ""overflow"" room for kids. Neither room had a chair or anyplace to put clothes/suitcase except the scant floorspace, and no hanger for a wet jacket. I asked if it would be alright if I read a book in the vacant family room. She responded that ""Most guests stay in their rooms."" Not so nice, message received! The next morning at 7:45, there was lots of stomping just outside my door (despite the retired couple leaving their shoes by the front door), and one of their 10 cockatoos shrieked loudly for a good while. Again: message received. They needn't have gone to all that trouble; i was already awake and ready to go. Emily had  left a cup and teabag but no provision for coffee.  I took a last look at the still-standing Christmas tree and said goodbye forever to Air B&B."
22215712,403345093,2019-01-20,93024033,Ellie,Cute room and bathroom that were very clean. Easy check-in and perfect place to stop on my road trip! Emily and Ian were quick to respond. Bed was comfy and I enjoyed all the cat and parrot themes around the place. Mahalo nui loa!
22215712,403858483,2019-01-21,237206343,Adam,"Great stay! Clean. quiet, responsive communication. I didn't have time to ask Ian and Emily about some of the interesting artifacts in their home or their experiences in craft beer brewing. Next time..."
22215712,404352336,2019-01-23,111661549,Tanya,This was a nice little place. We really enjoyed our stay.
22215712,406713320,2019-01-30,126701278,Colby,"The place was clean had everything ready when I arrived. I would stay again if in the area. Very nice people and really neat knife, sword and gun on the wall real neat history behind them."
22215712,407327433,2019-02-01,239663108,Bruce,Emily was a considerate host. The property was centrally located too.
22215712,408211095,2019-02-03,17082924,Zoe,"My name is Radha and I am one of three people who were hosted at Emily's home.<br/>These comments only reflect my personal experience, not my friend Zoe who booked the reservation.<br/><br/>Our hosts were very gracious to let us stay even though we booked the wrong date.<br/>They weren't planning on hosting at all that weekend because it was their anniversary<br/>but they let us stay anyway.  Very nice.  Thank you!<br/><br/>I wished I would have read a lot more reviews before we booked it because they<br/>have about 8 tropical birds.  I'm aromatically very sensitive unfortunately, and I would<br/>have chosen differently had I known.  It seems like the hosts would put that more prominently in their profile, since it is such a huge presence in the home.  If you don't like birds in cages and the aromas that go with that, I don't recommend it. <br/><br/>Also, their profile says you can use the kitchen to prepare food.  All I needed was to<br/>to boil water for my morning cuppa and I mentioned that to Emily during the<br/>tour on arrival. She said that was fine. But at 7am when I was in the kitchen, Emily came out and it felt like I shouldn't be in there. She asked me what I was doing in a sort of uncomfortable way.  Glad I had no need to make food.  I left the kitchen as quickly as I could.  I used my flashlight, since it was still dark out and the birds were asleep, but that woke them and one of them squawked loudly.  <br/><br/>We rented both rooms as there were three of us and the room my friend stayed in<br/>had a lot of ants.  He didn't mention that until after we checked out, so we didn't say<br/>anything to the hosts.<br/><br/>I did read the other reviews, after the fact, and I was taken aback at Emily's unprofessional  responses to her guests, and lack of apology, when given critical feedback.<br/><br/>The bed was comfortable and the price was great!  And the window opens."
22215712,409406842,2019-02-07,240679544,Tiffany,Excellent place to stay at. Emily is very nice and made sure I was comfortable. I stayed at her place for 3 nights and booked another 3 nights in the upcoming month.
22215712,412865520,2019-02-16,53110295,Timothy,"My stay at Emily's place for four nights was lovely. The room is indeed private and tastefully appointment with antique photos and artwork, and artifacts arranged on a wall. The bed is at least a queen and quite comfortable, and there are two end tables with lamps and the overhead light fixture has a Tiffany-esque shade that is lovely. The bathroom is immediately across the hall and fully stocked with soft white towels, and everything is clean. I'd definitely come back and it's a great value. Emily is a great host, but not a talkative one, and I happen to like that."
22215712,414132606,2019-02-18,68267385,Sage,Lovely space nestled in south Salem. Wonderful hosts and a quiet space. Highly recommend.

22215712,431359065,2019-03-31,1103056,Shelly,"If you don't might a truly 'shared' space and birds and a cat, then you might enjoy this.  Owners like to talk and were friendly enough.<br/><br/>For me this was an uncomfortable space, as I like more privacy and a separate entrance.  Very noisy form their TV and talking on the phone, birds very loud, walking through their front door into their small living room felt like we were intruding. Bathroom is shared. Bird cages in kitchen.  Bed in green room very bouncy and you roll to the middle, so not so good for 2 people.  Cat came in our rooms, and there was cat hair on both beds and chairs.   Green room's decorated with weapons and a painting of a battle...a bit uncomfortable."
22215712,432376294,2019-04-03,250121184,Leo,Hidden treasures. Living history.  Lovely parrots

22215712,437559596,2019-04-14,1759097,MaSovaida,"Emily and Ian were such wonderful and gracious hosts! They gave me great recommendations for things to do around the area, and I had a great time chatting with them at their awesome brewery. The room was very peaceful and comfortable, and the cheery bathroom right across the hall was clean with plush towels and extra toiletries. Great value, great people! Thank you, Emily and Ian!"
22215712,438873208,2019-04-17,204763054,Jennifer,"An excellent experience. Hosts were friendly, engaging, and fun. Offered a lovely breakfast on my first day, and shared lovely conversation about books, archery, and history. The cat is adorable and incredibly friendly, and I enjoyed learning about the birds! Absolutely book this space if you are looking for friendly and eccentric conversation!!!"
22215712,442104939,2019-04-22,192181864,Michelle,Fantastic location and neighborhood. Nice sized rooms with a great clean bathroom.

22215712,444296304,2019-04-27,6005158,Brenda,"Emily’s place was comfortable and clean complete with an  amazingly friendly cat! Do be aware that Emily keeps many birds who greet the morning sun with loud enthusiasm. As we had been on the road for two full days, I was awake earlier than I would have wanted. Otherwise, Emily and Ian were kind hosts and made us feel welcome."
22215712,446937119,2019-05-02,14469309,Fitz,Very laid back and accommodating couple.  Dare I say eccentric style but it all worked to a great effect.

22215712,450986684,2019-05-10,16860344,Cyndi,"A good night’s rest was had! Bed was cozy, and coffee was available in the morning. Emily was a lovely hostess and even treated us to complimentary flight cards when we mentioned we’d be swinging by the brew pub that they own."

22215712,459007695,2019-05-26,7745645,Akhilesh,Little gem few miles from Salem downtown! Emily and Ian are wonderful hosts and welcomed us warmly on arrival. Bedrooms and common areas were neat and cozy. Enjoyed waking up to bird chirps! Highly recommend and would definitely return if we're in the area!
22215712,461566483,2019-05-31,180201340,Coleman,"Emily was a great host and allowed me to have a late check out, which helped me tremendously. It felt calming to hear her birds, I felt like I was in a jungle. Overall great stay!"
22215712,463685351,2019-06-03,110594821,Laura,"We really enjoyed staying with Emily and Ian. Given we'd made a cross country drive, Emily was very gracious in being flexible with check in. We loved the beautiful space, the gardens and koi pond, and the beauty all around, and for a great price, too. Everything was very clean and Ian and Emily and friendly and welcoming. I highly recommend them!"
22215712,464493839,2019-06-05,264989884,Larae,Nice room in a lovely home. Just what we were looking for for a quick overnight in Salem.
22215712,465970807,2019-06-08,266617556,Rena,Amazing and lovely place to stay. I wanted to stay longer to enjoy the gorgeous garden outside the window. Ian graciously drive me to catch the airport shuttle which is conveniently closeby. I will definitely seek them out if I need to stay in Salem again!
22215712,466820586,2019-06-09,127046465,Stefania,"Very uncomfortable mattress. They have a parrot 🦜 that woke us up at 6 in the morning, I love animals but the bird started to sing and talk non stop until we checked out, we actually checked out earlier than expected because of that."
22215712,469496896,2019-06-14,226422460,Colin,"Very good communication! No matter what time of day, they always got back to me quickly and on top of that kept me advised"
22215712,470058345,2019-06-15,41110047,Brandon,"Ian and Emily’s place is a gem, we enjoyed our brief stay there very much and hope to return in the future. They were so welcoming and accommodating. Their house has so much fascinating decor, including a picturesque garden in the back surrounded by plants and a koi pond.    It was magical, thanks again Ian and Emily for the hospitality! :)"
22215712,471045957,2019-06-16,12793045,Jackie,We had a great sleep and a pleasant morning chatting with Emily and her husband.
22215712,473481967,2019-06-21,263585285,Aliyah,"Emily is a kind host. She let us know about her husband having guests over prior to arriving. She also gave us a tour of her home. Her parrots are awesome and the kindest cat we have ever met. Our bedroom was beautifully decorated with everything described. There was also a menu on our bedside table of their owned restaurant. Emily was quick on her toes when we asked questions. Lovely owners, cute pets, and very decorative room. Also allowed us in the kitchen, dining room area where the parrots reside. A bit dirty, but understandable since there were guests (friends) at that moment. All in all, we enjoyed our stay. :)"
22215712,475146247,2019-06-23,23816039,Rodrigo,Nice house in a really nice area.

Koi pond and waterfall in backyard.  Great local tips from the hosts. Convenient location to everything, downtown, river park, Trader Joe's.  Hope we get to return and stay here again."
22215712,485896570,2019-07-11,245135898,Dawn,Lovely private room in a quiet neighborhood of Salem. Enjoyed our stay!
22215712,487162889,2019-07-13,267453566,Aspen,Emily's private room was perfect for my fiancé and I on our trip around Oregon!
22215712,488085947,2019-07-14,67584554,Karolina,A British-Colonial theme with old war regalia on wall. Menu to restaurant brewery couple owns in room.  Sweet cat greeted us for 5-10 minutes in room. Did meow in the middle of the night-maybe wanted to come into room? Lively parrots in the morning.  It was a nice quaint stay.
22215712,490459881,2019-07-18,252659052,Jorge,Excelente
22215712,491166198,2019-07-19,32309569,Shawn,"Very accommodating.  We had been stuck in traffic on the I5, so, se did not arrive until almost 1:00 am, but we were given the door code and  greeted buy purring!!!!"
22215712,492973129,2019-07-21,271422303,Grace,"Rooms in a private home, Shared bath, it seemed to be a strain to keep up the place. <br/>Friendly hosts, lots of harmless animals.  Be sure to get a code to re-enter."
22215712,493588426,2019-07-22,260411882,Skylar,Very friendly and accommodating hosts. They allowed me to change a small specification in my reservation last minute and were very understanding. Their animals make you feel like you are at home. I highly enjoyed my stay here.
22215712,495944395,2019-07-26,254458937,Ben,"we enjoyed our stay at the house. the hosts were so hospitable and helpful. the house is inviting and comforting. beautiful decor, and such unique lamps. the back deck is a secluded paradise that is decorated to an immaculate degree"
22215712,496619834,2019-07-27,148880481,Moises,Emily’s home was breathtaking for us.  The walls are painted vibrant colors and all the decorations were absolutely beautiful.  The back yard is nothing short of a garden you might pay to walk in and relax.  <br/><br/>Emily and her husband were entirely relaxed and hospitable and made us feel comfortable using one of their rooms as well as the common space right away. <br/><br/>The location is very close to the I-5 so if you are looking for a place to rest this is the ideal spot.   It’s only a shame we didn’t spend more time there.
22215712,498504556,2019-07-29,185388787,Genna,Emily’s place is clean bright cozy and charming. Easy stop off I-5 for a peaceful rest.
22215712,499620320,2019-07-31,199907042,Kris,For $39 a night this place is fine.  I had never stayed in an airbnb before but thought staying in someone's house would be a great way to meet new people. Emily is not the friendliness and I hid out in my room the only night I stayed.  Ended up booking a hotel room for the 2nd night.  I broke the house rule about wearing shoes inside and was headed to my room with supper but was stopped and relegated to the back deck which  no food in the room is also a rule. I take full responsibility that I didn't read the rules close enough.  Emily messaged me from inside while I sat outside letting me know the shoe rule. When I told her i wasn't staying the 2nd night she made sure to let me know that she thought it was awkward that she had to explain the rules.  There are birds in the kitchen so the floor was a mess but I didn't notice the noise much as some had mentioned.  I never did meet the cat.  If you're looking for someplace to sleep and nothing else this place is perfect.  Bathroom is across the hall from the bedroom so it's not possible to completely hide but I tried.
22215712,500154934,2019-08-01,87817287,Kennady,Emily was very hospitable and communicative! We had a great stay and I recommend this place to future guests!
22215712,501565762,2019-08-03,9817749,Elin,"Emily was perfectly nice to us, but we just were uncomfortable with the decor of our rooms, and the general vibes of this place.  The parrots and koi were cool.  Our rooms had very strong primary colors in high-gloss paint, and warlike wall decor; not conducive to good sleep!  We felt uncomfortable and left as soon as possible.  However, different strokes for different folks!  You might like it."
22215712,502390925,2019-08-04,42728142,Mark,"Although I only stayed one night and was not in actually in the house very much, my stay was quite pleasant. My bed was very comfortable, and my bedroom and bath were spotless and charmingly appointed. Emily and Ian were gracious hosts, and we had a fun, all-too-brief chat before I left. This was my first time here, and I definitely plan to stay here the next time I come to Salem."
22215712,504461227,2019-08-07,2839802,Estelle,We are grateful to Ian and Emily for a comfortable and cozy stay. They have a lovely home that is full of character. If Ian is around ask him to show you the coolest bar in Salem :D
22215712,505018842,2019-08-08,48630908,Brenda,"Amazing value. Comfortable,  unique home in nice neighborhood."
22215712,505754077,2019-08-09,74322093,Jo & Allen,"We had a nice little stay at Emily's. She is very sweet and kind. And we were lucky enough to be there on a Thursday night to attend choir practice on the back patio - priceless. Great cat, birds are cool. Great value and location"
22215712,506499028,2019-08-10,6902527,Pascale,"Emily is a generous, kind and gracious host. My daughter and I had a wonderful visit, thank you, Emily! We would gladly stay again."
22215712,508359924,2019-08-12,85071973,Melissa,Emily and Ian have a very comfortable home- Our room & bathroom were really clean and nicely decorated. We enjoyed visiting with them a little bit when we arrived in the evening. Their house is in a nice residential area that’s not too far from the 5 freeway. Great stay overall!
22215712,509603429,2019-08-14,78497958,Elizabeth,The neighborhood seems very safe and quiet. The home is not too far from I-5 and close to stores. The hosts are lovely and very interesting and friendly. Their garden is gorgeous and their birds are wonderful company. I would definately stay with them again.
22215712,512966500,2019-08-18,154811794,Patrice,Emily and Ian we're very kind and helpful. We would stay there again.
22215712,515990891,2019-08-23,88176852,Ben,Great hosts. Great decorations. Friendly cat. I was worried when the reviews said there were some birds there and while they can be a little talkative during the day they won't wake you up at night and they're separated pretty far from the rooms. The backyard is beautiful as well.
22215712,517824193,2019-08-25,95857849,Mary,Very clean comfortable room and good location
22215712,530431108,2019-09-15,185841798,Ismael,"Our stay was delightful!  Comfy and relaxing rooms! Emily and  Ian where great host, we would recommend anyone to stay there."

22215712,537509113,2019-09-28,94565859,Olivia,"Emily, Ian and Furkin are the greatest hosts! Furkin is such a celebrity of a cat. Choose this Airbnb to meet the one and only Furkin and stay for the awesome, sweetest hospitality provided by Emily and Ian. Fun decorated space on top of it all too."
22215712,538362154,2019-09-29,278411320,Lisa,Very nice friendly couple. Enjoyed a good nights sleep. Bed was comfortable and private.

22215712,544656249,2019-10-10,111339876,Diane,"Emily and Ian were so kind and friendly. They showed us their animals because we were curious. Emily made us a wonderful breakfast in the morning of bacon, sausage, eggs, and toast. We had great conversation with them. This was a great place to stay! I am also usually allergic to cats, but I wasn’t bothered one bit by their cat."
22215712,545127325,2019-10-11,134602086,David,"Emily and Ian were exceptionally hospitable. Emily served us dinner in the evening when we arrived at their dinner time and then a full breakfast, joining us at the table with her own breakfast. wonderful conversation."
22215712,546479746,2019-10-13,227220874,Bob,"Bed was comfortable, room and bathroom clean.  Communication was great.  If you like beer and good food, go try the Santiam Brewery which they own!  The Shepherd's Pie was super tasty."
22215712,547354969,2019-10-14,141926484,David,Great place! Very friendly
22215712,547695275,2019-10-15,49914,Carolyn,"Oh my goodness this was a fun and unique stay -- I never expected anything like this in Salem! It felt just as much an Airbnb Experience as lodging. Emily and Ian, the cat, and the parrots were all so very welcoming. Based on past reviews, I wore earplugs to bed -- but they were not needed at all. No bird noise until well after breakfast, which was also tasty and filling and not something I usually expect with Airbnb listings these days! The bathroom was spotless, and I enjoyed the colorful and unique decor throughout the house. I wound up staying in the blue/purple room (the other listing) and found the bed to be the right amount of comfort (not too hard, and not one of those too-soft memory foam deals). Definitely recommend this if you're looking for a place with character -- both the home and its occupants!"
22215712,548453976,2019-10-17,1339088,Carol,"Emily’s place was clean, decorated wonderfully, and a nice breakfast was included. She and Ian were fun to talk with. I highly recommend them as hosts!"

22215712,552924428,2019-10-22,302583971,Heather,"The company and conversation was a treat. We connected with Emily over our love for animals, nature and planet protection. And we had the opportunity to see the 'special room'....being British, it was a thumbs up and cheers!"
22215712,554594409,2019-10-26,627214,Andrew,"Emily and Ian are the most thoughtful and generous hosts you will find in Salem. Breakfast was substantial, and very good. Emily introduced us to her gorgeous Sun Conures. Firkin, the extravagantly friendly Tuxedo Cat, introduced himself. The rooms are decorated with warmth and taste. The house is comfortably, not antiseptically, clean. Parking is easy on the cul-de-sac. You will be within minutes of anything you want to do in Salem or Keizer. I recommend without reservation that you make a reservation here."
22215712,555464216,2019-10-27,303987361,Angelika,"Emily's place is a very nice house, it's very clean and very comfortable."

22215712,573000918,2019-12-04,5230863,Mary,Emily and Ian are kind and generous people. Emily offered me homemade bean soup among other goodies when I asked about a nearby restaurant. I left very early in the mornings for meetings and she offered me steaming to go coffee and more treats on my way out the door. Had my own private room and bathroom away from their private upstairs area. Enjoyed meeting her parrots who are serene and shy. Excellent value. Great Airbnb hosts.
22215712,575624881,2019-12-10,157578965,Jay,Great location for I5 travelers.
22215712,579114281,2019-12-19,20535457,Shahidna,Emily’s house is simply unique and beautiful. It feels more like a fancy hotel than an Airbnb. Love it! Her cat is so friendly. Would definitely stay again!

22215712,607477482,2020-02-17,150139675,Theresa,A very nice decorated room at a very convenient location.
22215712,610084469,2020-02-23,247652650,Jered,"Tasteful clean bedrooms; comfortable and creatively decorated living room space with ample seating and a large screen TV.  Wifi log-ins are posted in the bedrooms.  The home is on a quiet cul-de-sac about 5 minutes from the freeway in the south part of town.  Winco, Trader Joe's, and several gas stations are just a couple minutes away.  If you're around during the daytime, you'll probably get to meet Roger and Amigo or see the koi in the backyard pond.  Emily and Ian are both quite friendly.  We enjoyed getting to know them a little bit, and yet we still had ample time and space to ourselves."
22215712,611367869,2020-02-26,24864587,Brenda,"I was afraid there would be noise from the parrots and brought earplugs, but really it wasn't a problem. The cat is sweet and doesn't appear that much either. All in all, a quiet and very comfortable space."
22215712,617379822,2020-03-12,59411303,Pam,"Ian and Emily are friendly and gracious hosts.  I was hesitant to stay in an AirBnB that was within the owners' living space, but they made it comfortable and easy.  The very reasonable rules and expectations were clear from the beginning.  The decor was interesting and homey.  I like animals, so it was fun to have the friendly cat around. The parrots were fun to watch and learn about, and they impact the peace and calm of the sleeping quarters at all."
22215712,618854221,2020-03-15,325673984,Kim,Everything was perfect! Their home is spotless and they are great communicators!

We needed to catch a good night's sleep as a break in our travels and everything turned out just right. Thanks to Emily for being well organized and presenting a comfortable, quiet, clean place for our rest."

22215712,676153030972534300,2022-07-21,453724552,Lilian,Comfortable bed. Cute decoration with home feel. Bathroom clean and hosts were really conscientious on giving me privacy to let me use the space. Quiet neighborhood and still easy access to fast groceries or pick me ups if needed. Easy to communicate with. Bonus cat to guard you and birds to squawk in on a conversation.
22215712,680465599330464956,2022-07-27,46344908,Sora,Perfect!

22215712,681964674632038491,2022-07-29,44842754,Karen,"The perfect overnight stay after a long drive. We enjoyed the patio and coy pond. Comfortable bed, slept well. Many restaurants and stores nearby. Emily and Ian were very accessible and gave us our privacy. Very nice people."
22215712,682712693559552349,2022-07-30,53456447,Bastien Et Lana,"We are crossing the States during our honeymoon and loved staying one night at Emily’s ! <br/>The place was quiet, comfortable and very nicely decorated ! <br/>We absolutely recommend it !"
22215712,683383478317157435,2022-07-31,300027362,Tyler,The home had what we needed for an overnight stay. Street parking was available. The room was clean and comfortable.
22215712,688454991039724933,2022-08-07,410694111,Emily,"I would highly recommend this place for single women or those that want the comfort of others around, you would feel more comfortable here then a hotel. Neat decorations as well. It is apparent Emily has gone to a lot of work to tastefully and thoughtfully decorate the space. Ian responds quickly to any message needs."
22215712,690650075481944765,2022-08-10,33737280,Fred,Great value and location.
22215712,692882471290697954,2022-08-13,141343569,Kellie,"Clean, comfortable space just as described. Firkin the cat was nice and hung out in the room with me for part of the day (although you can shut the door to keep the cat out if wanted). I loved the quirky/cute bathroom decor with cat towels and parrots. Emily and Ian gave us our privacy but were easy to contact via the app. We didn’t have a chance to chat with them while we were there. The location is in a safe, nice neighborhood. I felt comfortable keeping my car full of luggage outside."
22215712,696441697014114400,2022-08-18,271126658,Leticia,Amazing host. Would definitely stay at this location again.

22215712,708015386271801933,2022-09-03,369888904,Erin E.,"I had a lovely time here.  Asthetics like the sumptuous colors and Tiffany-style glass really made this place special.  I was greeted by friendliest kitty you ever did meet, and we felt right at home."
22215712,708793546076407633,2022-09-04,477447533,Melody,Pretty much exactly as described. Good place for a night or two.
22215712,709545996515786495,2022-09-05,29879836,Chris,"This is a good option on the south side of Salem. You will receive a code to get in/out of the house as you need and a private bath separated by a hall. I did not see the hosts during my stay. I am thinking they were asleep when I arrived and were out when I left. I did meet their cat though, who was quite friendly. Everything else was clean and comfortable. This is a good pick for a private room stay in the Salem area."
22215712,713099705220545931,2022-09-10,15919368,Jessica,Lovely house in a quiet location. Partner and I were in the area to visit friends and this was perfect for us for a couple of nights. <br/><br/>Ian and Emily were both very helpful. Firkin is very cute.

Their cat was very friendly, and their birds were quiet at night. The location is in a quiet neighborhood, and it felt very safe to park the car on the street. Would definitely like to stay here again when I'm in the area."
22215712,732712664920904205,2022-10-07,219347261,Armando,great place to stay!

22215712,745705421858699222,2022-10-25,183963367,Irene,Wonderful stay with real rainforest theme from the parrots and bath decor was delightful!<br/>The bed was perfectly comfortable and even enjoyed a bath. Such a peaceful home ; the birds sing in the morning 😂

22215712,755132506547818760,2022-11-07,28052845,Franny,"Emily and Ian are very unobtrusive. One would hardly notice that we shared a space. They invited us into their very nice, upper-crust (as my dad would say) British styled home. It turns out that Ian is an ex-pat. I love pets and theirs are no exception."
22215712,766082298200153460,2022-11-22,237399213,Julia,"My partner and I had an excellent stay at Emily and Ian’s place. <br/><br/>The hosts were very kind and welcoming. This space is unique, you will have a great time looking around. Their kitty was extremely friendly as well! <br/><br/>We felt right at home in their space, and they were able to accommodate our last minute booking. <br/><br/>Safe neighborhood, close to essentials (Walmart, restaurants, highway). <br/><br/>We loved this spot and it was priced very reasonably. I absolutely would come back if I find myself in Salem again!"
22215712,769658756897807361,2022-11-27,483709813,Chris,I didn't spend allot of time at the house.. My first night I was very cold. There just wasn't enough blankets on the bed. I got up and made coffee but I wasn't sure if I had permission to this but at that point I was looking to warm up.. Ian greeted me and apologized for the lack of bedding. Emily was a blessing.. she made me feel comfortable.. we had a cup of coffee together and she shared with me her house.. she took to a special room and I could understand why it was so special to her/them. I would be happy to stay at their place again at the lower cost..
22215712,772531106211529663,2022-12-01,194408961,Bri,"we absolutely loved our stay, their house and decor was amazing!! emily was incredibly attentive and fast with responses and their kitty was the sweetest little guy, very lovey and loved to lick so if you love cats (and birds), this is definitely the place to go!!! the birdies were loud just in the morning but also not too loud that they couldnt be fairly blocked out by some earplugs or headphones if you need to sleep later than when they start yellin :) the space was beautiful overall and we felt very welcomed!"
22215712,781255217281827659,2022-12-13,460725963,Eric,"Exactly as described, nice neighborhood, pleasant and very comfortable bed and good sleep. Would definitely stay here again."

22215712,818193222092450323,2023-02-02,51789952,Sonya,What a wonderful place to stay! Highly recommend if you’re looking for an interesting spot to stay in Salem. Emily and Ian were incredibly kind and I loved all the color and art in their home. The birds were a treat as well and quiet at night as was described.

22215712,850134766776181719,2023-03-18,387386370,Gary,"Emily is Avery sweet lady. There are these amazing birds she keeps in the non-rental part of the house. I found their calls and whistles very pleasant, even comforting."
23234197,251340699,2018-04-07,119169758,Samreena,"Communication is quick and easy, very helpful with local tips, and very hospitable. This is a home away from home!"

23234197,258829475,2018-04-29,72350536,Sunitha,"Nicely maintained space with a roomy living room, a well-appointed kitchen and 2 great bedrooms in a great location. Felt like a home away from home. Highlight was the toy room for my 2yr old. He had a blast with a variety of toys, made it super easy to engage an active toddler! :) The house is kid friendly. They had a booster chair which we could use at dining and the backyard play area was also great. We enjoyed the Keurig coffee and the breakfast items were all well stocked.  The only thing was that we needed a little more room in the closets for our clothes. It was quick & easy communicating with Jason and the instructions were clear. Overall it was a very comfy stay and we will surely consider coming back! :) Thanks."
23234197,261681107,2018-05-06,185775881,Rosemarie,Jason is very responsive and accommodating.  The location is great!
23234197,263729566,2018-05-12,63964556,Hannah,"Our grade school kids enjoyed the playroom. Their parents, us, enjoyed sleeping in our Saturday morning thanks to that playroom. <br/>Thank you."

23234197,268344908,2018-05-24,5661620,Hee Eun,Jason’s place was a very comfortable place to stay. We were on our way north and needed somewhere to stay the night. This was so much better than staying a local motel/hotel.  His house was very clean and we really appreciated that there was no shoe wearing in the house. The floors were immaculate. The house was well stocked with all the kitchen amenities we needed and the beds were really great. Got a good sleep for traveling the next day. An added bonus was having chopsticks to use for our meals. Definitely recommended for anyone staying in the area for a longer period or just passing through.
23234197,271594474,2018-06-01,118368780,Louisa,"Jason's house was perfect for our trip to Portland from So. CA. The accommodations were perfect for our family. We relaxed and watched a movie. The laundry room was an added plus. The full kitchen allowed us to prepare are meals. Breakfast was a delight. We went on a day trip the next day to the Benedictine Abbey in Mt. Angel 30 minutes away and Jason was amazing for letting us check out late. I would recommend Jason's home to anyone visiting the Salem, OR area!"
23234197,273900822,2018-06-07,169194038,Hy,"It is a nice and super clean house , you will love it , Jason is a great hoss you will receice his reponding quick."
23234197,278304113,2018-06-17,181296282,Jen,"For my family's stay in OR this house was perfect! The beds were very comfortable, providing restful sleep after long days of hiking. We were able to cook meals, making this a cheaper, more comfortable option than the local hotels.  Jason was always very responsive and accommodating! He has done some nice updating to the house; the layout is great. Having access to the laundry was a big plus. Although, the house is on a semi-busy street the fenced backyard makes for a quiet, private outdoor space. Our little one enjoyed the playroom and the outdoor toys! Overall, wonderful experience if we ever are in Salem, OR again we would consider staying at Jason's again. "
23234197,280250056,2018-06-22,11162497,Robby,"Jason's place is great. Highly recommend it, especially if you have kids."
23234197,287124708,2018-07-07,180750841,Dan,"Jason's house was the perfect home for our stay in Salem Oregon. The house was super sparkling clean ! Jason even make sure there were lots of bottled waters available for us.I would highly recommend it,especially if you have kids."
23234197,288454850,2018-07-09,74397620,Maren,"Jason’s place was comfortable, clean, spacious and inviting. We slept well and the place was very clean and comfortable."
23234197,290068423,2018-07-13,11162497,Robby,"Had a great stay :) second time booking, would book again. "
23234197,291406608,2018-07-15,151541325,Donna,"This was far superior to staying in a hotel.  The house was spotless, the beds were very comfortable, communication was great, the ease of checking in and out was spot on.  It was easy on and off the freeway location was great, restaurant stores less than a half a mile away.  Quiet and safe neighborhood all in all I would absolutely recommend this place and will stay here again."
23234197,293687839,2018-07-20,894656,Lindsay,"This is the owners home or maybe vacation home. It seems as though the family stays elsewhere when the house books. It was slightly new for us having all the family’s belongings out, but it ended up making the stay more comfortable. Great kitchen for cooking, big tv with fast, reliable internet, nice showers with double head and bath with jets, new laundry machines, well stocked with basic foods. On the outskirts of Salem, but not a bad location. Great communication from the host Jason! We would definitely recommend!"
23234197,294200050,2018-07-21,168027992,Steve,Great location and well stocked 
23234197,299299331,2018-07-30,36014816,Lynn,"Jason's place was great. Easy to get to,  lots of space, very clean and peaceful. The beds are super comfy + the area was quiet = great sleep! An adequate kitchen allowed me to cook all our meals during our stay but I noticed a Shari's restaurant just up the road if the need had arose. ;) All in all a pleasant stay and we would most definitely return. "
23234197,304039013,2018-08-08,205602450,Ben,This house was exactly as described. It was clean and hospitable.  We would definitely rent it again and Jason was a stupendous host. 
23234197,308101037,2018-08-15,19904045,Louis,"This home couldn't have been more perfect for us. Traveling with a 3 year old can be less than fun, but the house was set up for it. An entire playroom full of toys and movies. A kids bed on the floor in the master bedroom. Everything you could think of was there. The house is beautiful and spacious. It's located near lots of restaurants. It was perfect for a trip to Enchanted Forest. Highly recommend!"
23234197,309771267,2018-08-18,104156100,Alexander,"Jason's home was exactly what I needed. clean and he left clear instruction, thank you!<br/>"
23234197,310547965,2018-08-19,44477077,Lindsey,"Jason was very accommodating to our needs, we had a great stay :)"
23234197,320343934,2018-09-08,50161508,Usborn,Great place to stay in Salem! They were so generous with their house!
23234197,325070751,2018-09-18,60221890,Dean,"This copy-paste from the host summarizes our experience perfectly:  ""I have to disagree with your assessment of the house. I think our reviews speak to that but you are quite sensitive to certain things that no one has ever mentioned before, so I’ll note those things for future reference. For example, the toys are in the right spot to us and many families who have stayed here - the playroom. No one has ever complained about the vacuum in the dining room (it has to stay on a charger) or flashing lights of the wifi. I suppose the dining room is more of an art and utility space to us so it’s something not noticed by us. Actually I just slid the cabinet over for now to allow extra heating from the vents under the TV but again, I guess others are more sensitive to such aesthetics. Basically the complaints seem a bit harsh from my point of view since we live here, it’s not just a “rental property” but it is what it is. The house has worked out great for all our guests in the past but I’m sorry it didn’t work out for you. Anyway, I’ll issue the refund."""
23234197,327943996,2018-09-24,66627587,Thuy,"Jason's home was just right for us as we were visiting for a wedding and exploring the local area. The home was clean,  and well organized. We made use of the kitchen, laundry, and TV. We appreciated that Jason stocked his kitchen with many conveniences such as breakfast items. We would definitely like to stay at Jason's home next time are in Salem."
23234197,330668325,2018-09-30,45618681,Jordan,"Jason’s home was the perfect home base for our group’s weekend in Salem. Clean, comfortable, and cozy! The continental breakfast and great communication was also very appreciated"

23234197,345250284,2018-11-04,195901383,Kathy,Thank you for a clean place. It's everything he described. Just a busy road.
23234197,352121681,2018-11-24,218202715,Gaynor,"Jason's Place was our families first Air B&B and staying there felt as comfortable as being in our own home. The tea, coffee/coffee maker, orange juice and snacks were a wonderful touch! All the items in the kitchen made it easy for us to have several home cooked meals even on Thanksgiving Day.  The location was convenient for us and stores were near if we needed to buy something.  We liked that the home had plenty of room to spread out, two full bathrooms, Wi-Fi, cable TV and lots of seating. Being from Hawaii, we do not worry about cold weather but Jason's Home Instruction Book was helpful to understand not only how to operate the heater but helped give general information about the home. Our family was extremely satisfied with our stay at Jason's Place!"
23234197,408232796,2019-02-03,122075811,Daryl,Jason's place was very clean and well organize.  The house was very  spacious for 3.  The check in process was very simple and easy.  I hadn't spent much time in Jason's home so i could only share what  i could.
23234197,415059439,2019-02-21,241136430,Misty,Nice clean home to relax in. Great for a small family.

23234197,442897963,2019-04-24,247531862,Jill,"Great place to stay if you have young kids. My family of four stayed here for a week - mom, dad, a 3 year old and a 1.5 year old. There are two ridiculously comfortable queen beds (wish the Master was a king though), a toddler bed, and a pack and play! I do wish the rooms had some sort of dresser to put clothes in as the closets are already in use.<br/><br/>Ample, open space with two large bathrooms. My girls loved the toy room, Netflix, and the backyard. We also liked that we could park in the garage. <br/><br/>Jason was very accommodating and provided a high chair."
23234197,449881114,2019-05-07,5018263,Laura,"Jason’s house was everything we needed for traveling with kids. There were toys, a play house, a swing set, crib, high chair, and so much more that made things easy and fun. The house was clean and well-stocked and the location was within an easy drive of everywhere we wanted to go. I would stay there again and highly recommend this place for families!"

23234197,471009081,2019-06-16,205546488,Sureya,Jason’s home was super clean and filled with anything one might need to enjoy their stay. His home was welcoming and we enjoyed it so much. It was perfect for our family of six!!

23234197,479315284,2019-06-30,261578595,Sakurako,I stayed at Jason's to spend a weekend with out of town friends.  His house was very homey and comfortable.
23234197,483804857,2019-07-07,19907051,Lindy,"This house is clean and incredibly convenient, particularly for traveling with young children. The host had all the information we needed available."
23234197,488279331,2019-07-14,19750608,Cenicio,"Our family of 6 felt right at home. Besides the great deal in price and amenities for families with young kids, we have 4 kids, the location close the the 5 freeway and all the great places to eat was a added bonus. Highly recommend to anyone regardless if you have a family or not."
23234197,491168483,2019-07-19,253957023,Robert,"House was better than expected. Not that we expected anything terrible but photos didn’t do it justice. Nice home, spacious, kid friendly... kids toy room was so entertaining for our children. Coffee maker, pots and pans, washer/dryer all nice amenities! Descent size back yard. Would stay again if in the area! Thanks"
23234197,497779297,2019-07-28,36014816,Lynn,"Jason's place is great. This was the second time we had stayed and it was great then too. Quiet neighborhood, easy access to the freeway, excellent space with all the amenities of home. We're hoping to stay again. 😊"
23234197,500804917,2019-08-02,279423806,Luz,It was a great location and very quiet place to stay. The house was exceptional and very clean felt like I never left home.. i would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Salem
23234197,502466757,2019-08-04,547058,Carla,"Jason’s house was beautiful! I was a little nervous as it was my boyfriend’s first time staying at an Airbnb and he was skeptical and I wanted it to be a good experience for him since I’ve never had a bad Airbnb experience. He was so impressed and pleased! It was comfortable, the temperature was perfect, the beds were comfy, the hot water was plentiful and the water pressure was awesome. <br/>The house was immaculate! Jason had “continental” type food for us to eat if we wanted and provided delicious coffee for us. I would 100% stay here again and absolutely recommend this home for you. <br/><br/>Thanks, Jason!"
23234197,509529045,2019-08-14,258621649,Ron And Marilyn,"Get location, clean and hosts are very accommodating. Have stayed at this home twice. Plan to stay in the future."
23234197,513643414,2019-08-19,179774914,Ryan,"We loved our stay in Salem! We traveled with a 3 yo and particularly enjoyed the play room, which was stocked with plenty of age appropriate toys that he was able to play with. The house was clean and everything we needed was easily found. The house was perfect and very comfortable for our stay."
23234197,523488957,2019-09-03,8724325,Barak Ben,Jason’s place was great for our needs when we came for work in Salem. <br/>The place is very nice and clean.
23234197,534603514,2019-09-22,288452649,Joavanna,Location was perfect. It was only 5 minute drive to my Aunt’s place. It was closer to stores and everything.
23234197,539183388,2019-09-30,281922035,Debra,A very nice spacious house with high ceilings.  Jason did a great job in communicating as it was our first time using an Airbnb.  And a great location to the places we needed and wanted to go for dinner etc.  We would definitely check to see if this is available again.
23234197,547721354,2019-10-15,137010914,Liam,"This house is a great place for families or groups of 4-6 people. It's clean and has a well stocked kitchen if you need to cook. Additionally, I made a mistake and booked one less night then I intended to. Jason worked with me to let me book an additional night last minute and I am very grateful for that."
23234197,552872622,2019-10-22,116772053,Kristin,"Jason's place makes traveling with young children a breeze.  From the hours of fun to be had in the playroom and outside play area to the kid-friendly beds and other offered amenities, our whole family was happy and comfortable.  Communication and check in were great, it was very clean and super well stocked, and it is perfectly located for our needs.  We will definitely be back! Thank you Jason!"
23234197,555624292,2019-10-27,233878852,Zuhey,"Spacious place, comfortable beds, and very clean. Also, thank you for letting us use the garage for our van.<br/>We would definitely consider staying here again."
23234197,582861713,2019-12-27,258621649,Ron And Marilyn,"Pleasant home, clean and comfortable beds."
23234197,604878216,2020-02-12,4264131,Aba,"We had a lovely stay at Jason's house with my mother, husband, and infant! The house was exactly as we expected based on the listing and the reviews, and was exactly what we were looking for. We needed a house with a washer/dryer and close to the people we were visiting (speaking of, the playroom was a hit with their 4yo!) Jason was highly responsive before and during our stay, and we also really appreciated the very clear instructions and guidelines in the binder. Would definitely stay here again!"
23234197,645956888,2020-08-02,73120527,Jamie,"Our stay went well. There was coffee and tea and the beds were comfortable. There was plenty of towels and the washer and dryer worked well. Nice sized Tv and good yard space. Someone came to mow the yard while we were there which was nice nice we stayed 2 months. Jason was quick to respond to questions when asked. Overall, we were pleased with our stay."
23234197,655640870,2020-08-23,73894129,David,"I loved staying at this house. When we go back to Salem we will look at staying there again. <br/>     First of all, the location is great! You are only about 5 minutes to I5 and even less to markets and restaurants. We found a new breakfast place that you have to try. It is called Toast and Jam. Breakfast was great (try the coffee cake on the side), dinner was so so.<br/>     Jason was a good host. Great communication of what to expect and what they expect from us (not much).  <br/>     The amenities were great because they offered the use of their washer and dryer which made life so much easier. Not a small w/d but a full size great SamSung w/d. Even better than what I have at home. They also provided the detergent. They also had more than adequate soap at all the sinks and TP and paper towels. I really felt at home and liked that I didn't have to go to the store to get any supplies that I would only use very little of. Seems like someone lives in the house and left it for me to use as I need.<br/>     If you have little ones, they have some play things and books that would make it easy for your kids to spend some time enjoying. <br/>    Only 4th AirBnB experience, but best so far by far.<br/>Thanks Jason!"

23234197,700043072,2020-10-12,260273941,Judy,"This home is outstanding. It is very welcoming and comfortable. It's in a prime location, close to restaurants, shopping, and the freeway, yet in a very nice subdivision. The best part for us though is that it was perfect for my elderly mother and my young grandchildren. To say it was kid friendly is an understatement, it was set up for kids and they loved it. We loved it too, because they were well occupied. There's two dining tables, which was nice for our family to have. The Keurig was a nice touch to our mornings as was the complimentary tea. It was very clean and very easy to keep clean. I will recommend this home for others visiting the area."
23234197,706759319,2020-11-05,72168521,Wanda,"Jason was a great host and communicator.  The house is in a great location in South Salem.  I had room to set up ""office"" space and plenty of room.  I especially appreciated the holiday touches."

We enjoyed our stay here"

23234197,759357852,2021-05-16,223176454,Ed,This is a large clean house in a residential area of southern Salem. The photos are accurate. The house has a play room and a swing set out back.

There was a toy room with toys and books, a toddler bed, and a backyard with a swingset. Shopping for groceries was nearby, the home was clean, and communication was quick. Thanks Jason!"
23234197,395619127300923840,2021-06-29,11313423,Michelle,"Jason was especially considerate. He offered to get down a high chair from the attic for our baby and had a pack and play set up on our arrival. The playroom was especially nice when we needed to avoid the Oregon heat wave. My only suggestion was it was difficult to determine what was complimentary for guests and what was just personal items of the hosts (there was a lot of food/ drink in the fridge and miscellaneous items on the counters) so as a result, we initially felt like we were encroaching on the host’s space. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and appreciated Jason’s kindness and communication."

23234197,419620954757386431,2021-08-01,207443385,Brianne,This was the most kid-friendly home we’ve stayed in. My kids (ages 5 and 3) had a blast with all the toys. We loved that there was a little car bed with crib mattress that we could use for a crib for our 3-month old baby instead of the pack-n-play that we brought. We really have no complaints! Very clean and comfortable.

23234197,450049331308540479,2021-09-12,74325223,Beth,"This home perfectly met our needs. We were going to get a hotel when a last minute trip sprung up for us, but found this home instead. Traveling with 3 kids, we couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay. The playroom and backyard were perfect for keeping our kids entertained. Beds were comfy, home was clean, and it was extremely close to everything we were doing."

We had a minor issue getting into property on night one and Jason was quick to respond after 1 am in the morning. He was very courtesy with all communications. The house was clean, comfortable, and perfect for children as they had toys, activities, swing set in back. We also had access to cable, netfiix, etc.  I will never stay at a hotel again. Highly recommend this home. Neighborhood was well kept with nearby garden, which kids enjoyed walking too.  Plenty of stores near by."

It was very comfortable and felt like home. The best part was how child friendly it is. Our little girl had so much fun in the playroom and playing in the garden."

23234197,680490573602652848,2022-07-27,456980528,Tyler,"Jason's house was perfect for our family stay in Salem.  We have a toddler and an infant, and the house was great.  Our toddler loved her ""racecar bed"" (toddler bed in the master), and it was a struggle daily to get her out of the playroom or the sandbox in the back yard.  We really appreciated the pack-and-play for our infant to sleep in as well.  The house was well maintained, and because it had air conditioning, we didn't mind visiting when it was pushing 100 degrees all week.  We will definitely be looking to book again on our next trip to Salem."
23234197,684144512106057817,2022-08-01,460799568,Amaan,Jason is an amazing host - very quick responses whenever we had questions. The house is also very beautiful and spacious.

23234197,701553508030776123,2022-08-25,276868795,Michele,This place was super clean and comfortable with a well stocked kitchen. Very kid friendly and close to I-5. We would definitely stay here again.

23234197,725423084807730584,2022-09-27,338062013,Linda,Very roomy home. Two beds are a plus … great place if you have small children. We liked the idea of having the extra bed for me in case my husband had a rough time sleeping. The queen bed was very comfy and we both slept well. Love it when there are small fans provided too. Clean and a good location too.  Close to grocery and restaurants.
23234197,730469636645409522,2022-10-04,453862688,Jennifer,Loved it. Super homey vibe
23234197,736298102240986132,2022-10-12,31103789,Kat,"Jason's home is one of the most fully outfitted with the comforts of home that you could find, complete from coffee and tea brewing and steeping options, incredibly plush beds with extra blankets, a huge master suite, a full kitchen without any missing needed cooking utensils, and so on.  The home has a driveway for the parking and is in a nice section of town near ease of shopping for everything from Trader Joe's to Walgreens and more.   There is a bit of road noise in the front of the house, but it is not noticed in the bedrooms at night at all, it feels very quiet.  If you have small children you will be thrilled at the playroom!  The picture book library is a children's author writing dream, if you need a writing cabin!  For me the playroom served a good yoga room.    Jason's binder of information is helpful, and the instructions are ""just right,"" not overboard, very appropriate.  We would absolutely return when we are in Salem again and we recommend this place highly."
23234197,737743104617713679,2022-10-14,390496724,Arleigh,This Home is perfect for traveling with toddlers.

We heard quite a bit of road noise from the master bedroom. Jason was slow to respond to my initial inquiries for information after booking his place. And at checked, I sent him a text per his written instructions which he never responded to."

23320790,734145076,2021-02-24,28814687,Amy,"Don and Karen are a great couple who really enjoy having students/nurses around the house. They made sure I felt comfortable in their home, whether it was the temperature of my room or with plenty of space for food in my own mini-fridge and pantry space! They’re very easy to chat with but there is also no pressure to hang out if you’re busy. You have access to most areas of their house, and are always available to help!<br/><br/>As a female student, I felt very safe in this neighborhood and in their home. It was very clean, and their dog Zona is the sweetest and best girl ever! I would highly recommend anyone to stay here!"
23320790,489128638727929911,2021-11-05,380763692,Ronalie,"Amazing stay, location, and hospitality! If you are on rotations or need a long term stay, this is the place for you. The home is located in a great location with food, coffee, and stores within minutes away. The shared bathrooms are kept clean and tidy. The room decor makes you feel at home and is a great space to come home to after a long day. There is more than enough room for kitchen items in the refrigerator and pantry. A big highlight is the Keurig, in which cups are refilled daily. The hosts are kind and make you feel welcomed and safe. 10/10 recommend!"
23320790,589215787264607909,2022-03-23,126308116,Lauren,"Couldn’t have asked for a better experience! Don and Karen are extremely welcoming and accommodating.

24019630,768426268,2021-06-09,1187020,Rachel,"Jean's place is a wonderful space for families with kids.  There is plenty of space for everyone and the space is thoughtfully decorated from bedroom to bathroom to even the open space leading to the different rooms.  As her description mentions, there is no TV but plenty of educational toys for the kids and plenty of books for enjoyment of kids thru adults.  Note that the apartment is accessed thru a flight of stairs from the front of the house but parking for the car is thru the gate in the back.  Only negative is the kitchen which is a bit limited in terms of amenities (no stovetop nor water kettle) but we made do with the rice cooker & microwave for simple meal preparation (she does provide muffins and yogurt and juice for breakfast).  Big plus is hot water never ran out with 4 people taking showers one after another with bathroom being well heated.  Backyard spacious and good place to hang out should you choose to."

Rooms are comfortable and beyond squeeky clean.  Jean has thought of everything you might want or need and then put it in hands reach.  She left delicious home made treats and  light breakfast goods for us replenished them as they got used and checked often to ask if we needed anything.  Our hostess was a friendly resource for information about the area.  Really enjoyable to talk with and also very respectful of our time and privacy.  Century House will be our first choice when visiting Salem."

24019630,668945502315810452,2022-07-11,3280519,Lynn,"There aren’t enough stars to rate Jean and the lovely Century House!  We rented 2 rooms in this lovely house for an Ironman race.  We were late getting in and were going to head straight to dinner to meet friends, but Jean encouraged me to stop by the house first to drop off my racing back so it would be safe.  She was waiting with a welcoming smile when we arrived.  She quickly showed me around and had me store my bike in the lovely dining/sitting room.  I was BLOWN AWAY by this adorable home! She has comfy lovely touches with homemade quilts and beautiful decor.    We had a shared kitchen and small dining/sitting room.  The fridge was stocked with juice, milk, yogurt homemade granola (beware if nut allergic), muffins, fresh fruit and treats on the counter!  She had coffee and tea, as well.<br/><br/>We pretty much had the upstairs to ourselves aside from 1 or 2 nights.  We were in and out alot due to pre race race activities.  Jean accommodated all of my triathlete craziness by finding a place to hang my wetsuit outside and a safe place to practice transitions.  Her garden is an oasis!  My daughter enjoyed the hammock and the sweet black cat Carl.  Jean would come up and empty our garbage, recycling and compost cans daily.  She would open and close windows to  make sure the house was nice and cool when we got home.  If there were dishes, she would wash them!  She even made my daughter’s bed!  So sweet.  We came back to fresh blueberries from the Farmer’s Market!<br/><br/>My favorite part of our weekend was sitting enjoying coffee with this amazing human, sharing stories of cycling and animal rescues.  Jean is a talented quilter and we couldn’t resist buying a pillow and some bicycle potholders!  We really love Jean and have made a friend for life!  Do not pass up an opportunity to stay at Century House.  I promise, you will love it!"

24373913,301757097,2018-08-04,26589033,Janet,"Marissa, Elliott and their dog Maggie are very sweet. We started the visit by walking our dogs together as a way to introduce them and keep contentions at a minimum. The bed was very comfortable, and storage for clothing very adequate in the space. The house is so clean and comfortable. The bathroom was the best, very modern, spacious and clean. I was able to find a wine bar down the street, and they are not far at all from a variety of restaurants. It was perfect for walking, very flat, safe neighborhood. The stay was great, Marissa is kind to talk to, and I was able to go to sleep really early, there was no trouble with noise! Thank you Marissa, Elliott, and Maggie for having me and Tawny over :) "

Comfy bed, heated floors, and nice backyard. Not a lot of personal space since the house is very open, and the bedroom door is a sliding door that just lays across the door frame so it doesn't seal shut, which can cause for noise to transfer from inside and outside the room. A good place if you are just looking for a place to sleep after being out and about all day."

24373913,647906990125970614,2022-06-12,56539940,Ellen,"I was so happy to find Marissa’s place for a last minute trip to Salem, and it was better than I expected! Marissa was extremely accommodating and helpful. The location was perfect, just minutes from downtown in a cute neighborhood. Marissa’s home is spotlessly clean and the bedroom is cozy with a comfortable bed and lots of closet space. And the backyard with it’s covered seating area is a great space to relax at the end of the day. Wonderful!"
24373913,655914420935924984,2022-06-23,161717647,Kim,"Shared bath seems like it's private, host is very descreet."
24373913,658740712201693579,2022-06-27,15905325,Halina,"We had a nice one night stay and very much appreciate that Marissa made an exception to accommodate us with our 4 year old daughter and two older dogs. Although the space is set up to be coziest for fewer beings, we made it work and appreciate that Marissa gave us a quick respite on our way through town. We also appreciated that Marissa allowed us to park in the driveway since we were traveling with a lot of gear that we wanted to keep safer. Had we had more time we would have enjoyed the beautiful backyard space more and the house itself which is cleanly and charmingly decorated. This is a great spot for a single traveler or couple."
24373913,668852478121894123,2022-07-11,116134733,Bill,"Marissa is a really great host and her home is comfortable and immaculately clean. I was in Salem to do the Ironman race and Marissa was super accommodating to everything I needed to get ready, including putting up with my 4 am wake up on race morning. I would definitely recommend to friends and I’d stay there again if I’m ever back!"
24373913,671749269448213685,2022-07-15,12720332,Adrian,"A really convenient stay in Salem. Communication with Marissa was fast, we were greeted when we arrived (self check in is also available), the room and house is comfortable and clean."

24373913,676871102975814887,2022-07-22,120803133,Madysen,"The host was gone so I had the place to myself.  That was really nice. As stressed it is more of a shared space. Very nice house, had a great stay."
24373913,677629142474386994,2022-07-23,88787336,Carol,"Impeccably clean and furnished with a cute backyard for outside dining and lounging.

24373913,679770943858375291,2022-07-26,214299056,Kathleen,"This is a lovely home in a quite neighborhood in Salem.  Absolutely loved everything about the stay up to the end when I was accused of all sorts of things.  Made it sound like I had trashed the place.  I had not.  I did let my dog sleep on the bed.  I had missed the rule that says no dogs on the bed.  Melissa claims it was stated clearly in house rules.  Looking back I was not able to find the house rules in materials sent out ahead of my stay.  I did read house rules provided at the home.  If no dogs on the bed was in there I'm sorry I missed it.  Asked to pay additional cleaning fee which I have no problem with.  Perhaps a pet cleaning fee up front would be easier for everyone.  A 'no dogs on the bed' sign in the bedroom would have been helpful too.  Melissa had a guest host, Ana, during my stay who reported I had smoked in the house and had many other complaints about me.  Attempted to communicate with Melissa about these issues and received no response.  Such a bummer.  It is a great place but communication during my stay was a major issue"
24373913,680547941957277729,2022-07-27,310739108,Cyndi,Clean and comfortable.
24373913,689191632474014906,2022-08-08,471371037,Maggie,"Marissa's room was just as it claimed to be. The room was cozy and beautifully arranged. The bathroom, as it was not private, was quite large, plenty of room to dress in. My host was home only one of the three nights I stayed, but she was kind and the house remained very quiet, you'd never know you had a housemate. Well worth every penny, would 100% recommend this rental."
24373913,698632539115325726,2022-08-21,18655599,Laura,"A lovely space to rest after exploring Salem and the surrounding areas. Marissa was very accommodating, and has some good suggestions for coffee on her guidebook."

24780208,260714061,2018-05-04,31674102,Anne,"Elizabeth truly is a “super” host. Having stayed at her lovely estate before (in one of the rooms in her home), I had come to expect all the amenities she provides to her guests — from cable TV and Wi-Fi to a convenient kitchenette set-up with a mini-refrigerator, coffee maker and breakfast pantry. On this occasion, however, I was able to book the cottage (next to the pool) and was so pleased with this new experience that offered a small living room (with an electric fireplace), a full kitchen with gas range/oven, microwave, toaster and full-size refrigerator, a dining table and ample countertop space for food preparation. And, Elizabeth has thought of everything for the cook! I discovered so many cooking tools and equipment, from measuring cups to frying pans, baking dishes and spatulas ... No plastic plates! Nice ceramic dishes, bowls, serving plates and glassware. The well-stocked bathroom with shower (and any toiletries I might have forgotten) is downstairs. Upstairs, I had a comfortable queen-size bed, a large desk, spacious closet and a HUGE television. Both rooms had their own electric heat pump, so it was easy to adjust each room for heating or cooling. As on my other visit, Elizabeth and her son, Cris, were available to assist me when I needed it (mostly for my cable and Wi-Fi questions). I highly recommend the cottage, especially if you are planning to have a longer visit in the Salem area."
24780208,262972431,2018-05-10,64967605,Elisha,"We spent our one year anniversary here. She had champagne, a card, and candy for us! Elizabeth was so helpful and kind. The best airbnb I've stayed at! She truly made our time there special!"
24780208,266281234,2018-05-19,81574977,Darlene,"I was only passing through but so glad I chose Elizabeth’s. She was very helpful and showed me around the home and property. This charming little cottage was a nice spot to unwind and relax after driving. A hot tub is available and a pool although the pool wasn’t ready to open yet. There is everything you need and a few extras, like fresh eggs from her chickens. I hope to stay again and spend more time in the area."
24780208,267473129,2018-05-21,154598224,Tina,Loved the location and Elizabeth was an amazing help..
24780208,267794505,2018-05-22,40709142,Amanda,We booked this on a whim when we need to spend one night Salem. We could not have been happier. The location is amazing! You turn off a busy road and then into a secret garden. The hot tub was an incredible touch. <br/><br/>We would be back! Thank you!

I really liked that it had very useful amenities both in the kitchen and in the bathroom. It was so much better than staying in a hotel
24780208,299828185,2018-07-31,127627323,Leslie,"Really enjoyed my 2-month stay.  Cottage was comfortable, very clean, well furnished with all of the amenities.  Location was perfect for my summer job in downtown Salem.  Elizabeth was very friendly, responsive and accommodating - always wanted to make sure that I had everything that I needed.  Check-in was very smooth - she sent directions and photos of the road sign, cottage entrance, parking spot, etc. which made her place easy to find.  Highly recommend.  I would stay there again."

The cottage is super clean and cozy, it has everything that we needed, everybody loved it!  Elizabeth is a great host, she not only showed the cottage that we booked but also many of the others which brought a great time to our kids.  I made a mistake in booking by missing one room, Elizabeth offered another room to help me get the issue resolved, that’s very generous and very impressive,  I felt that I was super lucky to chose Elizabeth’s house.  I would come back if I go by next time "

24780208,310577329,2018-08-19,100505768,Jenny,"If I could give 10 stars, I would! Elizabeth was so accommodating for our group and was quick in communication. We had a group of four and it was just perfect for us! She went out of her way to make us feel comfortable. She seemed like a friend who we could ask if we needed anything or if we had any questions. We arrived very late and in the dark, but her directions were so clear, we had no trouble getting in. The house had everything we needed, was comfortable, and homey. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone coming to visit Salem!"

The king size bed upstairs was so comfortable I didn’t want to leave the bed. Elizabeth provided fresh eggs, banana bread, almond milk and water in the fridge. The neighborhood is quiet and provides a peaceful place to rest after a long day. Elizabeth is a fantastic host and if we are in the area again we would definitely choose her place to stay! Thanks again! "

The host provided fresh eggs from her chickens, a new half gallon of milk, yogurt, English muffins, fresh fruit, etc. Lots of seating, a TV on the lower level and in the bedroom, comfy King-size bed, clean bathroom - even a private swimming pool for use if wanted. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. And Elizabeth, the host, was an excellent communicator. Perfect place to stay."

There were eggs in the fridge from Elizabeth's chickens which was very thoughtful of her. There was a few issues that came up but Elizabeth was able to get it sorted out. Also she was very understanding and sweet to let my friend stay pass checkout time for a couple of hours as I was taking my exam. Thank you for the wonderful time! I highly recommend!
24780208,325815815,2018-09-20,216299890,Brien,"We were pulling into Salem last minute, and I finally heard back from a couple rooms that they weren’t able to take us in, so I scrolled through Airbnb and  gave it one last shot, and in less than  a minute Elizabeth  accepted my request and contacted me. It was unbelievable how she took such good care of us on such short notice. The place was better than we could’ve hoped for, and our host was very kind as she welcomed us in the driveway."

Loved the homemade jam and fruit and having the option to cook meals, though our schedule didn’t leave us time for that.  This  will be our go-to choice whenever we come back to the area for visits!!"
24780208,345329860,2018-11-04,126207628,Shelby,"The space is great, close to a lot of fun things, we only spent half a day actually in Salem but the riverfront Park is great, and we had a wonderful time thrift shopping at Engelberg Antiks-huge selection. A full kitchen, made two big meals there, everything for basic need for dishes, I brought my own lasagna pan but skillets and serving dishes and utensils were provided. Basic breakfast supplies, clean and stylish space. It was quiet and peaceful, the dvd selection is lacking so if you’re banking on a group movie I would bring your own from redbox or something for the downstairs tv but we ended up playing trivial pursuit and had an even better time. Host was wonderful, very attentive and hospitable. Was great for my boyfriend and I with my brother and his girlfriend for dinner and breakfast. Easy entry, had everything we needed there and felt very at home, highly recommend for your stay in Salem or visiting nearby.  Host mentioned google directions are slightly off but Apple maps took me right to it so just a heads up that if you have an iPhone you should have no problems finding it :)"

Fridge was loaded with terrific goodies, including organic milk. The beds were really comfortable and even though it is small, 2 adults with 2 teens and two dogs did well in the space. Elizabeth was a terrific host and allowed us to come in early. The price was awesome for all the great amenities she provided."

24780208,368419211,2019-01-06,7959160,MaiLinh,"Some friends and I came to Salem to visit nearby wineries. Elizabeth's place had all we needed- a kitchen to make a meal, coffee, towels for the hot tub, a radio, TV with cable to catch some playoff football, and a convenient location to downtown for dinner and wineries not far away. The hottub was nice and hot. Her property has big trees around which was nice.<br/><br/>It's an older home with some character, but good value for what you pay."
24780208,368975340,2019-01-08,62556793,Kirk,Great place to land for the night!
24780208,401184696,2019-01-13,26761081,Rick,"You are in for a treat here!  You have your own parking space and enter a gate into a courtyard with a pool and a hot tub!  Easy keyless access and a refrigerator with everything you need for a nice breakfast in the morning...even 1/2 and 1/2 for coffee!  The place was cozy with many special touches that helped us feel relaxed and comfy.  The location is convenient to downtown.  If you are a vegetarian, check out Taproot for a great meal!"
24780208,402811263,2019-01-19,143165565,Michelle,"Our group thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Elizabeth's guest house. The space was adorable and full of all of the amenities that we could think of! We especially appreciated the selection of breakfast items.. as graduate students on the run to classes, being able to grab and go was much appreciated! We can't wait to stay again, especially when the weather warms up, since we didn't get to enjoy the beautiful backyard and pool!"
24780208,403428948,2019-01-20,163130204,Ashley,The stay was great. Very hospitable and great place!
24780208,404097243,2019-01-22,26603705,Danielle,Everything you need in the kitchen & bedroom! Very thoughtful baby accessories. Comfortable bedroom. Elizabeth greeted us upon arrival & provided excellent communication throughout our two night stay. Thanks again!

24780208,406240228,2019-01-28,85377735,Nimi,"Lovely space.  Private, comfortable, nice kitchen area.  Elizabeth provided eggs, bread, cereal, coffee,  and an extra baked good for breakfast, which made the morning so easy.  Even the fold-out bed in the living room was comfortable.  We didn't take advantage of the hot tub, but it was a great additional amenity.  All in all, a lovely place to stay."
24780208,410158698,2019-02-09,43775219,Charissa,"Elizabeth's cottage was clean, comfortable, and convenient for our Salem adventures. She made every effort to make sure we had every amenity available including fresh eggs, granola, and fruit.  We would definitely visit again."
24780208,411236879,2019-02-11,76181166,Brittany,We chose Elizabeth's place because it was a short distance to the local wineries.  We were very pleased with our stay.  Her home was beautiful and comfortable.  She responded quickly to our questions and was very accommodating.  The hot tub was also very nice after a day at the wineries!
24780208,412113323,2019-02-14,97966889,Esther,"Cute little two level airbnb. The electric fireplace is a nice cozy touch in the winter and Elizabeth does an amazing job stocking every amenity possible. She is extremely responsive and helpful, even offered to help me unload the first night! I found this location ideal for my trips downtown and to the capitol for my business stay. Very close to food places (could walk if you want), a drive through coffee kiosk, and a roths grocery. Only about 2 miles away from the Public Library. Wifi and everything worked great. I would stay here again. Very clean and neat. Was very cozy while I was there and it rained every day. Only thing I would say is keep in mind you are walking past a swimming pool and make sure you are aware of this, elizabeth provides a flashlight at the carport.  I had no issues and didn't need the flashlight. I found it fun to be back behind the pool. Only regret was that it was too rainy to try out the hot tub."
24780208,412917600,2019-02-16,241154928,Richard,"Really enjoy the cottage, nice and quiet."
24780208,413612065,2019-02-17,240280366,Rebecca,I was very happy staying here at Elizabeth's B&B and would recommend if your in the area to stay there! I know I plan on coming back!

Super comfortable bed and it's within easy walking distance of groceries, restaurants, etc. Elizabeth was communicative and flexible with changes I needed to make. The place was clean and comfortable with wonderful amenities."
24780208,421545432,2019-03-09,143165565,Michelle,"This was our second time staying at Elizabeth's wonderful guest suite, and just like before, this place was charming, well-stocked, and made us feel right at home. Cannot wait to stay again next time we are in Salem!"

24780208,425113564,2019-03-17,61812136,Meg,The home was fresh and clean and wonderfully private. There was fresh fruit and breakfast items available as well as many little needful things.  The hot tub was wonderful! Elizabeth was easily  communicative with any questions :)

24780208,429383429,2019-03-27,29636134,Michele,"Convenient location, comfy king bed, and fresh baked banana bread!"
24780208,431386391,2019-03-31,46041663,Michelle,"There is no doubt that this space is absolutely worth the money. I personally feel like the photos don’t do it justice. My husband and I stayed here for a local wedding and we were thankful that we were  allowed to bring our Yorkie. The space is updated and has everything anyone could need. Our only issue with our stay were the ants... My husband and I were in a bit of a rush upon our arrival because we didn’t want to be late to the wedding so we dropped our items and our dog off in a rush and did not realize that the whole bottom area of the unit was covered in ants. Yes they were only sugar ants and yes Elizabeth had mentioned she was having a little problem with the ants but gosh there were so many we ended up excluding ourselves to the bedroom after spraying ant spray all downstairs. My husband and I also could not get the AC unit in the bedroom to work. Mind you, we are very tech savvy and even went to the lengths to look up the exact model online and just couldn’t get it to work. Aside from those two issues the place was great."
24780208,433491527,2019-04-06,52651507,Heather,"This bnb has excellent reviews for a reason. Elizabeth truly is a SUPER HOST and a lovely person. She respects your privacy but makes sure you are having the best stay possible. We stayed in the cottage and it was the best bnb experience we’ve ever had. She has thought of every detail. The space is clean, comfortable and well appointed. The kitchen is set up with nice appliances and everything you need. <br/>On arrival she was very welcoming to our family. She even loaned our toddler some toys and gave us a tour of the chickens and ducks when we arrived. I really can’t say enough good things about our experience and the location. It's central to everything in Salem and yet is very peaceful and relaxing."
24780208,436305540,2019-04-12,89847029,Lauren,"Lovely and cozy place. Lots of thoughtful touches. Bed pretty soft if you are used to a hard mattress. Otherwise, perfect!"
24780208,437447737,2019-04-14,238945690,Debra,"Very cute little cottage!  We used the hot tub a few times and that was nice.  Elizabeth even had items stocked in the refrigerator for breakfast.  She also stocks many other amenities you might need.  Towels, a fully stocked kitchen and even toiletries were all available to us!  It was a relaxing stay and we were close to all the places we wanted to go!  I would recommend it to anyone!  ❤️"
24780208,438887116,2019-04-17,46800977,Debbie,"It was a very cute and cozy guest house.  Great location too.  Unfortunately, we ran into a minor ant problem.  According to the host, it can happen at this time of the year.  I would appreciate some kind of hints to set my expectations right."
24780208,439795600,2019-04-19,239543786,Jacks,"This was our first experience with AirBnB and we couldn't have chosen a better host! Elizabeth was incredibly nice, very responsive and she even left a beautiful arrangement of roses and champagne for our anniversary. Truly happy with our experience!"
24780208,441227838,2019-04-21,248716727,Devan,My husband and I are from the valley but currently live in Bend. We needed a place where we could have the space and privacy we wanted with our new baby and our dog. This was the perfect place for our little family to stay while visiting our friends and family! I would highly recommend this place to anyone but especially traveling families. We will definitely stay here in the future!
24780208,442101521,2019-04-22,4456185,Fiona,"This place is great for a single person or a couple. Very clean, lots of small touch amenities and the hot tub was really nice. Elizabeth met us when we pulled up, but if she wasn't there, the check-in directions we're very clear - including the fact that Google Maps doesn't work! Great experience and good deal, especially for a quick get away from the city."
24780208,442558953,2019-04-23,55707938,Rebecca,"We had such a lovely stay.  The cottage was adorable and comfortable.  Elizabeth was so helpful and quick to respond. The location is so convenient to shopping and groceries,  and she provided many options for breakfast that made everyone in our family happy. It's secluded and relaxing.  I highly recommend, and would definitely stay there again."
24780208,444257438,2019-04-27,2698997,Holly,Elizabeth’s place was just what we expected. I don’t like having to go downstairs in the middle of the night but other than that her place was perfect. She even provided toys for our grand baby who visited. We’re looking forward to going back in warmer weather so we can take advantage of the pool. Elizabeth was always available to answer our questions or deal with any concerns.
24780208,445665568,2019-04-29,256508326,Joshua,"Elizabeth was a fantastic host! She warned us our GPS would get us lost, so she sent step-by-step directions including pictures. She met us in the driveway to welcome us at Vista Manor, then showed us around the property. She even supplied fresh eggs from her chickens for breakfast!"
24780208,446568415,2019-05-01,229347785,Heather,"Elizabeth's place is a gem in the city. It's quiet, comfortable, and most important properly equipped. Anything you need Elizabeth will take care of. It was still too cold to use the pool, but the hot tub was amazing and the perfect answer to soak off a 7 hour drive. The house was clean, well stocked, plenty of everything, and Elizabeth is a great host and I would definitely stay here again in the future."
24780208,447448444,2019-05-03,35844478,Helen,"We finished our honeymoon at Elizabeth's place and it was absolutely perfect. Elizabeth was very hospitable and as well as being greeted by a clean and tidy place to stay we were given juice, eggs, bread, fruit and freshly baked banana loaf. We would definitely stay here again and have recommended to friends. Thanks Elizabeth!"
24780208,452735909,2019-05-13,13973584,Ellen,We loved staying at this cottage. It was perfect for 2 or 3 people. Elizabeth was gracious and helpful. It was great that we could bring our dog too! We will stay there again next time we are in Salem.
24780208,453053144,2019-05-14,4123381,Linda,"Elizabeth’s guest house was just as advertised—clean, private, and comfortable.  It is situated on a fairly large estate where Elizabeth has a variety of animals and a greenhouse that guests may chose to enjoy if they wish.  I really enjoyed seeing the baby ducklings and meeting the resident cats and dogs.  I was on business so didn’t get to enjoy my surroundings for long, but it was a pleasant place to unwind for a night.  I would happily stay again."
24780208,453746723,2019-05-16,166580797,Jenny,The location was perfect. Nice and private.
24780208,457280305,2019-05-23,201445234,Gal,"This is a cute guest cottage. The 1st floor is a nice living area with a full kitchen and bathroom. Upstairs is the bedroom. The bed is really comfortable, the sheets are super soft and it is very quiet. We had a very relaxing stay. Elizabeth is a great host. She was very welcoming and responsive!"
24780208,458998530,2019-05-26,131379298,Denise,This was a great place to stay Elizabeth went above and beyond with amenities and added convenient touches that made our stay all the more enjoyable. The hot tub was great.

We felt very welcomed there. Would happily stay again!"

Big comfy bed with big fluffy pillows and nice big flat screen in bedroom . kitchen is pretty well stocked had everything we needed .Nice quiet property with peaceful outdoor atmosphere. We came pretty early in season to early for pool was still being cleaned but looks like it would be a great time in the summer . I love that she has recycle bins that are easily labeled for dispensing! thanks for being eco friendly! So many vacation rentals are not and we drive around trying to find recycling bins definitely a plus for us!
24780208,465996043,2019-06-08,263316323,Kymberlee,The guest house is cute. The stairs get tricky with suitcases and midnight bathroom trips. We were greeted with a smile by Elizabeths daughter and Elizabeth always responded quickly.

24780208,472020643,2019-06-18,101993336,Mazloy,Elizabeth was an exceptional host. She was so thoughtful and the sundries in the home were above and beyond. The space is lovely and we enjoyed a cozy dip in the sparkling clean jacuzzi. Elizabeth offered a tip to visit an incredible winery and we had a magical time in Salem thanks to her. The beds were really comfortable and the kitchen was well stocked. The whole experience was warm and inviting. I would highly recommend this place and the host!
24780208,472962449,2019-06-20,37743772,Kirsten,We stayed at Elizabeth’s while visiting family in town & absolutely LOVED her space.

Elizabeth was so sweet and sincere. We had our own private cottage on her property and in the fridge were fresh eggs from her chickens and English muffins and a few yogurts. Was so sweet to have such a thoughtful gift considering we were constantly busy on this trip for our friends wedding. The hot tub and the pool were so nice to come back to. Over all this was an amazing experience and great memories."

Lovely special touches like flowers, breakfast items, etc. I look forward to staying here again!"

24780208,547294787,2019-10-14,63290458,Adam,"If you are looking to stay in Salem, Elizabeth provides a great experience! There were so many nice touches that we were blown away by! Highlights were homemade jam (I am assuming) and fresh eggs from her chickens!<br/>This is a small place with a large bed and great amenities. You can easily access the University and downtown by car or walk (if you need the extra steps). We enjoyed being able to keep up our morning runs in a safe, well lit neighborhood.<br/>We will be looking to stay here again!"

24780208,567141657,2019-11-21,34140416,Janet,"A great little place for 2-3 people max.  The king-size bed was so very comfortable; just the right firmness. The sofa bed was a bit soft for our son so he slept on the floor on his Japanese roll bed. Otherwise, completely efficient with everything anyone would need to prepare meals. We were in Salem to help restore an old Airstream and the hot tub and pool were greatly appreciated at the end of the day.  Elizabeth was very gracious and attentive to any requests, but on the other hand,  we felt we had complete privacy.  A great, secure location; close to downtown Salem and local grocer."
24780208,568793806,2019-11-24,184263904,Elizabeth,One of my favorite spots to date & if we visit Salem overnight again we’ll look to book here. Super cute inside and the hot tub was a great bonus!

Great decor and very easy check in . Excellent carport . Elizabeth is kind and thoughtful as a hostess! I’ll be back again the next time I need to come to Salem.
24780208,576518760,2019-12-13,316123643,Phu,"If this place is open and your considering it, don’t hesitate- book it!! Cottage is in back of house and very private. Amazing hospitality, quick to response, very easy self check-in instructions, very clean, well-stocked kitchen – even with rice cooker with rice supplied, numerous amenities, large flat screen TV with Infinity Cable, fast Internet, and knowledge of local places to eat.  Location could not be any better, central – within short walk or drive to everything including a park to walk my dog.  Comfortable bed and easy access to pool/relaxing spa.  Elizabeth was a thoughtful and responsive host. Would love to come back again next time in the area."
24780208,577743274,2019-12-15,86892507,Elisabeth,"Sweet, quiet little cottage tucked into the woods (and yet close to everything in Salem) with lovely hot tub just outside. Host was helpful and welcoming."
24780208,579861583,2019-12-21,191594094,Margaret,"This is really a charming place to stay.   It is wonderfully located in Salem, in a very nice neighborhood, close to downtown.  But still manages to be quiet and secluded.  But the best part is Elizabeth's attention to your needs and her very sincere desire that you enjoy your stay.  Which we did."

The location was ideal, close to downtown and lots of shopping around the corner including a lot of good restaurants. Elizabeth checked in with us almost daily to see if there was anything we needed which was so kind. We will be staying again!"
24780208,584173806,2019-12-29,827576,Akshay,"We loved our weekend stay at Elizabeth's place. The kitchen was fully stocked with breakfast fixings, which was very convenient. It's quaint and in a great location."
24780208,585342507,2019-12-31,263089406,Dahana,"Very warm place, Elizabeth was great at offering all the little things that sometimes we forget 😊 I will definately stay again!"

24780208,593696049,2020-01-16,28369674,Ramond,"Everything about my stay at Elizabeth’s was perfect. Complete privacy in a comfortable and spacious guest house. The fridge was stocked with breakfast food and bottled water. Coffee and condiments were stocked. There is a DELICIOUS hot tub, and I even had a bottle of Oregon Pinot Noir waiting for me as a welcome gift! I wish I could give the space 6 stars!  Definitely one of the top Airbnb’s I’ve stayed at EVER :-)"
24780208,594498053,2020-01-18,62065,Janet,Another great stay at Elizabeth's lodgings! Will be back again!
24780208,595781191,2020-01-20,143998677,Molly,"What a great place to stay! It's literally right next door to dining, grocery and main roads, but feels secluded. We're a family of 4 (two littles), plus a dog and we were super comfortable. The host was amazing and we look forward to staying again."
24780208,597503398,2020-01-25,128290242,Carol,"Loved the cottage. Lots of little extras, felt very secure. Nice kitchen...all round awesome."

So grateful as I was starving.      Comfortable bed.   Nice tv.     Great place.  Easy check in.     Love the host.
24780208,599311915,2020-01-29,2143228,Cynthia,Wonderful place to stay!

24780208,603915218,2020-02-09,143630087,Jessie,"Elizabeth's cottage was so cute and homey! It has absolutely everything you could need or want. She has thoughtful touches in the bathroom like toothbrushes, face wipes, and almost all the small stuff one might forget to pack. She also leaves a few small breakfast and snack items for you as well as providing a kitchen with pots, pans, plates galore. The king bed is comfy and the sofa bed is great for extra people. We were 5 people in the small space but it felt great! There is plenty of parking for cars too which was great.  Elizabeth was quick to respond to all my questions and concerns. She really cares about her guests' experience. I wish we had stayed longer! 10/10 would recommend!"
24780208,604571183,2020-02-11,40709142,Amanda,Another great stay!
24780208,605150785,2020-02-13,2143228,Cynthia,"Always a great place to stay.  This particular stay had special homemade bread in the refrigerator for me, Elizabeth met me at the parking (carport) and actually carried my suitcase in.  She showed me a few thing in the cottage - and even put a phone charger in there for me (because she knows I tend to forget when I travel) .  Always a pleasure to stay there."
24780208,606884208,2020-02-16,74109293,Taylor,"Wow! This is way better than I expected! The hot tub is so perfect! It didn’t make my skin itchy and having the pool all lit up next to it. The bed was SOOOO comfortable along with the sheets, pillows AND blankets !! I was so impressed! It had everything we could have thought of needing and then some! She accommodated to my infants need with a play pin and highchair! I will definitely be staying here again! :)"
24780208,607484234,2020-02-17,3509751,Lindsey,"Cozy, wonderful stay! We played scrabble and used the hot tub.  Our dog was able to roam around the fenced yard.  Great place to unwind, thank you!"
24780208,612086799,2020-02-28,114412698,Ben,Expect to be treated well and relax in a very comfortable setting.
24780208,613809416,2020-03-02,14696160,Alan,"Elizabeth has a very comfortable and thoughtful space. It has all the amenities and touches to make your stay very comfortable. I think if you are taller than 6'3"" and 225 pounds the shower and walk upstairs will be a little tight. By far, this studio 2-level is in the upper end of quality and service."
24780208,614583099,2020-03-05,2143228,Cynthia,"Elizabeth is always so thoughtful.  I appreciate her warming up the place before we arrived - the fresh fruit is great, and it's always like ""home""."

24780208,616812296,2020-03-10,43531648,Crystal,"Easy parking and centrally located, and comes with great communication from the host!"
24780208,617715404,2020-03-13,154504216,Sterling,"I had an event to attend and Elizabeth took the time to let me know how far it was from her home.  She was extremely helpful and responsive.  She also respected my autonomy and privacy.  The Air BnB was conscientiously stocked with all of those little comforts of home: Kleenex, Qtips, scissors, etc. and the kitchen was also mature with all of the apparatuses and utensils one would need.  There were many thoughtful considerations: water, fruit, etc.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the detailed check in instructions with pictures making locating, parking, and gaining access so easy.  I had no problem finding the place and there was ample parking in the carport.  The majority of the pathway from the carport to the Air BnB location is cement, so rolling suitcases work fine and you don’t have to worry about muddy shoes on a rainy day unloading your car.  I also felt extremely safe in the neighborhood.<br/><br/>The only consideration I would pass along would be that if you are a light sleeper, there is a large dumpster for the neighboring apartment complex right beneath the bedroom window.  On both days (a Thursday and Friday) the dumpster came crashing down at around 6:15 am.  One day it was caused by the garbage truck emptying it, and it sounded like the garbage came again the next day, but it was likely someone putting garbage inside.  The second day I was hoping to sleep in a little bit was unable to after that.  For someone who is not a light sleeper, this would probably wouldn’t be an issue."
24780208,619704458,2020-03-18,38845427,Elana,"Perfect location beautiful outside and in, hot tub was amazing, fresh eggs and lots of xtra thank you best Airbnb ever"

24780208,643990220,2020-07-29,65989638,Tammy,Very helpful flexible host. Air conditioning works great . Nice set up for 4. Pool was a nice bonus .
24780208,645304256,2020-08-01,122295976,Antonia,"Vista Manor was so much more than we expected with incredibly thoughtful details and a warm, welcoming environment.  We initially chose this stay to celebrate our anniversary because of the hot tub (clean and wonderful) and it's proximity to In-n-Out (only 20 minutes away), but would have been happy just hanging out in the space all day.  It was beautifully furnished, clean, and had everything you could need.  We'll definitely be returning to explore the area more!"

24780208,646755306,2020-08-04,1559859,Kale,"King bed upstairs with air conditioning, couch and desk allow for more functional space upstairs.  Pullout twin/full on main living space allowed for our daughter to have some alone time.  Full refrigerator, stove and all the kitchen supplies one would need are readily available.  Unheated swimming pool in the summer makes for a refreshing, almost shocking, afternoon dip.  In our nine years of airbnb, Elizabeth has the best communication of all the ""world"".

24780208,647832860,2020-08-07,355725627,Kattie,This was our first time ever vacationing like this and Elizabeth made it a wonderful experience. She was so kind and showed us how to use everything! She had this amazing book with suggestions and places to eat and things to do and we used that to plan a lot of our day. We went to ACME cafe which was 10/10 for breakfast which Elizabeth had recommended and it was within walking distance of the cottage. Such a relaxing and needed vacation. Thank you Elizabeth for making it such a great vacation. We will be coming back :)
24780208,648403176,2020-08-08,353309151,Aysia,"Elizabeth’s cottage is perfect. It’s clean with tons of amenities that you might need during your stay. Her pool and hot tub are a great bonus, too. Her whole property is beautiful and tucked back off the main road, which is so nice for a city like Salem. She’s a great host with great hospitality! If you’re rolling through Salem, this is where you need to stay."
24780208,649901474,2020-08-11,43388464,Kelly,"We had a nice time in the cottage. It was really nice to have ketchup, salt, olive oil etc in the cupboards and we didn’t use any, but thought it was a thoughtful touch that she had lots of bathroom supplies available and fresh flowers in vases around the cottage. The fresh fruit and eggs were also very kind.<br/><br/>Elizabeth’s communication while we were there was excellent. She was very accommodating and responsive. Our young children really enjoyed feeding the chickens and bunny and petting 2 of the sweet cats.<br/><br/>We felt safe and the house was clean.<br/><br/>The listing did mention that the pool was shared and was not heated. But I didn’t give it much thought since it would be in late August, I figured it would be fine. Unfortunately, it was too chilly for me and the kids to go in, but other guests swam with no complaints, so it’s likely we are just cold water wimps.<br/><br/>We would rent from Elizabeth again without hesitation."
24780208,650247807,2020-08-12,62806209,Kaysi,"Elizabeth’s place is truly in a beautiful spot.  I was surprised to find the accommodations were more spacious than I expected based on the photos, and our little family was quite comfortable there.  (My husband & I have two kids who were with us — a toddler & an infant.)  We appreciated thoughtful touches like the bowl full of delicious fruit that was waiting for us when we arrived and, though we didn’t get a chance to enjoy them, the farm fresh eggs that were left for us in the fridge.  Elizabeth was so kind as to invite us to join her out at the pool after our arrival, and although we ended up staying indoors to rest, we appreciated her kindness & hospitality.  We enjoyed our stay."
24780208,653902844,2020-08-20,286715283,Alexia,"Elizabeth is a great host! Super attentive and kind, and her response time was always almost right away. Her home is absolutely gorgeous and the hot tub and pool were great!"

From breakfast for tomorrow morning to a sewing kit in the bathroom to a throw blanket to wrap around your shoulders Elizabeth has thought of everything. The bed is super comfy. The place is as clean as a pin. There is a full kitchen. I could have stayed forever."

We won't be traveling back to the Southeast for Christmas, so having little touches like that provided us with warm feelings of family. This spot was in an excellent location, boasts a hot tub, and your fur-family is accepted with open arms. What's not to appreciate? We're already excited about exploring the many vineyards that surround Salem in the warmer months to come. If Elizabeth has the availability I'll def return. Thank you for all the responses to my questions and hosting us as your guests."
24780208,717015924,2020-12-20,65283173,Bryce&Lexi,"We were more then pleasantly surprised upon your arrival at this little guest house. Not only is the space cute and impeccably clean, but Elizabeth goes above and beyond to be an amazing host...I rented the place last minute for a girls night, Elizabeth’s hospitality really made us feel welcome! She was easy to reach and so accommodating and she left a generous amount of snacks and treats for us. The hot tub was nice too! My husband and I are avid Airbnb goers and we usually don’t stay the same place twice (we like to see different places) but I am definitely hoping to return in the future."

Near many great places to eat (Try Acme for Breakfast it is incredible.)   I needed a charger, and there was an office depot very close.     <br/><br/>The host is INCREDIBLE.  She takes you through the entire place, explaining all the amenities and how to use heat, stove, & leaves you breakfast in the fridge, snacks and fruit on the counter<br/><br/>There were huge fluffy towels to luxuriate in...a basket of ""did you forget"" items including things like toothbrushes & other toiletries. The bed was comfy, the fireplace provided nice ambiance.   <br/><br/>This location offers peace...though it sits close to everything, it is nestled into a wooded area and is secluded.   Your car is parked safety under a carport.    And a lovely desk with plug ins for your computer and phone.   I'm working on a book and I got several hours of blissful writing done while I was there!    <br/><br/>Book this place, you won't be sorry."

We appreciated the full kitchen and some staple foods/snacks that were available. The host was super quick to answer questions and always had someone on standby even if she was not available. We were there at the unlucky time for the AC to be acting up on a hot night, but the hosts were super quick to respond with some troubleshooting tips (the issue had never happened before) as well as where the fan was stored. Overall it was a convenient place for our weekend stay - we'd stay again!"

Spacious guest house with full kitchen and 2 floors, next to the pool on a huge property. <br/><br/>Elizabeth gave great recommendations of wineries and restaurants, and was very communicative. Also really appreciated all of the thoughtful touches such as breakfast goods, snacks, fresh eggs and all the kitchen amenities to cook with as well. One of her restaurant recommendations, La Hacienda Real, had the most authentic Mexican food we have had for a long time!! (My partner being a very lucky Mexican food eater highly approved!) And handmade tortillas. DELICIOUS.<br/><br/>It was awesome to be able to use the hot tub, and the property and gardens were super beautiful. On site parking was wonderful. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the pool wasn't clean and ready to swim in, but the hot tub was amazing and it didn't make our experience any less awesome here.  Highly recommend!"
24780208,757808881,2021-05-13,33614716,Aaron,Elizabeth was a great host who went the extra mile for us in terms of service and quality of stay. Possibly the best place to stay out of our entire trip to Oregon. Thank you again Elizabeth for letting us use your guest house!

It is on an incredibly beautiful property with friendly hosts and an adorable menagerie of animals. I only wish I had more time to stay!

We weren't expecting the beautiful manor house and lush grounds right off of a main street in the middle of town. The location really couldn't have been better, all the necessities are within walking distance and the cottage still manages to feel private and away from the bustle.  Elizabeth was an excellent host and we enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay again next time we're in the area."

This was the most stocked place I have ever stayed in.  She even provided breakfast foods; fresh eggs, fruits, English muffins, homemade preserves... If you forgot any toiletries (like me, I forgot my toothbrush) no worries, she's got that. Aspirin, cotton balls... I'm telling you she thought of it all. On top of her insistence of letter her know if you need ANYTHING, how could one have any more needs! she's got it all covered! The cottage is cute and cozy, had every thing you would need to make a meal, is clean, has lots of extra blankets, good working A/C... the yard is peaceful, the pool and spa are a nice to have.

24780208,501498507028562840,2021-11-22,22735050,Robert,"The description of the property matched what we found upon arrival. The check in instructions and photos provided  eliminated any confusion. The cottage was comfortable and well equipped. Given this time of year, it was especially helpful to have separate systems for heating upstairs and downstairs.  The bed was comfortable and the location extremely quiet so sleeping was excellent. <br/><br/>While we did have a few questions during our stay the response was quick and complete so that’s why we rated the hosts communication and attention to detail as 5 star. <br/><br/>The kitchen was well equipped and we appreciated the extra tray of food available to us if we needed it.  The Cottage is in a great location and was in close proximity to all the places we planned to see.  No doubt that should we visit Salem again that Elizabeth’s place be a priority to stay at again."

The property itself is a hidden jewel and Elizabeth’s directions are spot on, her attention to detail was amazing! We were there during Christmas, all the mugs, area rugs,toss pillows ,bedspread, throws and even the tissue boxes were holiday themed. I had recently broken my ankle and was pretty wobbly and using a cane the walkway was kept clear of snow and well lit. Elizabeth provided so many extras , bottled water, yogurt, eggs English muffins, coffees and teas, a big bowl of fruit,various snack items to choose from and more plus a whole basket of toiletries! The property is charming and you’ll never find a better host anywhere - we couldn’t recommend her more highly"

The host is very kind and provides extra touches like breakfast items. She welcomed me with a nice bottle of wine which was great to have after a day of travel getting here. The place is very clean and her touches made this feel like a home away from home.

The cottage stands alone on a property with a larger house and a pool. Elizabeth's communication and detailed instructions to find the house were super helpful as were the lighted pathway past the pool and through the garden as we arrived in the evening and it was fairly dark. The cottage was very clean and has some updates (floor and bathroom) but retains some original charm. Everything was in good working order and the fruit and snack baskets, fresh eggs, English muffins, yogurt, butter, jam, and many condiments were great for sustaining ourselves during our visit. Elizabeth checked in during our stay to make sure we were comfortable which I appreciated and was very responsive when I had a question about the lock. The wi-fi is great and the bed is very comfortable."

If you are looking for privacy-this is it. We were unable to find a location in Eugene for the World Track Event. So, this location in Salem was perfect and only an hour away. We didn’t get to make it to Enchanted Forest with the little one. My plans are to make it back and hoping to stay here again if booking is available. Elizabeth was an excellent host and responded swiftly to needs."

Elizabeth had great communication throughout our stay and was kind and welcoming to our family.  We really enjoyed our visit and are grateful to have been able to utilize her lovely patio and apartment.  We stayed for almost 2 -weeks while remodeling our own house and it was a great experience.  Large comfortable upstairs bed with air conditioning and pet friendly space.  Everything was clean and relaxing.  Good parking also as we needed to have 2 cars with us during our stay.

24780208,713815562399870209,2022-09-11,154481405,Kawika,"This is a small guest house on the side of a larger house.  The location is on the edge of a residential neighborhood, with apartments on one side.  You are quite close to the main road through Salem, with a grocery store and burger restaurant in walking distance, but most other businesses will require a car.  The hosts are nice, and have provided just about anything you might need in the location."

Although the space was small and the steep stairs to the bedroom was a challenge for a late night bathroom run, we felt welcomed and had the ability of parking the car in the carport near the guesthouse."

Location is nice and quiet but a short walk/drive to whatever you need. Great that it's pet friendly! Only small thing was there was a bit of a musty smell but overall we had a nice weekend stay here."

24780208,769730489483672485,2022-11-27,847296,Kathie,"We enjoyed a great weekend in Salem, wine tasting right after Thanksgiving. This cottage was close to downtown, super close to many stores, yet felt tucked away from the nearby road. Elizabeth’s place is very clean  and well stocked with everything we needed! And the fresh eggs and fruit in the morning were an extra special touch! The king bed upstairs was really comfortable - we slept well. Elizabeth was such a gracious host, and went out of her way to accommodate our early arrival. We truly enjoyed our stay, and would definitely return again!"
24780208,806643633540258340,2023-01-17,93833561,Charlie,Elizabeth is great! We stayed during the holidays and the room was completely decorated for it. Cozy space and she allows pets. Can't recommend enough.  A+
24780208,809592470700442471,2023-01-21,309251463,Mealani,"Elizabeth was a great host and the home was perfect. Very well stocked, very clean and so comfortable. Our dog loved the big yard to run and play in."
24780208,810288416699913291,2023-01-22,356149409,Tina,Lots of great touches like fresh flowers and fruit basket. Elizabeth was very responsive. I would definitely recommend this place. My only dislike was having to go up and down the stairs in the night to use the restroom.
24780208,811047246966733190,2023-01-23,69143830,Elizabeth,Perfect place for a stopover and appreciated the parking nearby so don’t have to unload quite everything. Dogs were comfy and appreciated the treats and eggs and breakfast things.

King sized bed upstairs very comfortable. <br/>There is pool near the entrance of the guest unit - something to consider for people with small children.
24780208,821089863867538445,2023-02-06,424481113,Mindy,Cute place. Elizabeth was a great host
24780208,824071166754192958,2023-02-10,499205207,David,"The place is great very private, and the amenities were perfect. The only thing may be to improve on is I arrived after dark, and it was a little hard to see the path to the place next to the pool. The only other comment I have is the light above the hood in the stove is burned out other than that it was a great stay."
24780208,824791933932860568,2023-02-11,77886340,Christina,"We stayed at Elizabeth’s place for a night before heading to Bend. Her cottage was cute, comfortable and well stocked. Elizabeth was responsive to all questions we had. Would have loved to stay longer!"

24780208,839264789899066000,2023-03-03,500640892,Lawrence (And Kathleen),Our stay at Vista Manor was just perfect for a place of our own--a refuge after tiring days of family reunion and the joy of little great grandchildren.   Everything was warm and cozy during stormy winter days.   We could not have asked for more friendly and helpful hosts.  We enjoyed every part of our stay and appreciated Elizabeth letting us extend a few more days when our family reunion was extended.
24780208,840766390437961462,2023-03-05,70649326,Natasha,Cozy cottage. Well-stocked kitchen. Appreciated the breakfast items provided.
24780208,846457013648433033,2023-03-13,114059225,Lugina,The place was great just not really what I needed.  Probably better for someone younger. The bed was upstairs and the bath down. I probably should have read the listing more carefully. It was very private and probably quite beautiful in spring and summer. Parking was great. The kitchen was well stocked. Elizabeth was very kind and proactive in her communication.
24780208,848667935073752719,2023-03-16,119130285,Beulah,"Elizabeth was extremely friendly and professional, made sure we were doing well and had everything we needed, even made a couple of exceptions for us due to our situation."
25873321,281387044,2018-06-24,54799501,Christine,"Stylishly decorated with new furniture, comfortable and clean. Kyle thoughtfully provided everything in this space—from Keurig machine to bottled water and snacks to hair drier.  There’s a small kitchenette area with hot plate and mini fridge, plates, kitchen knives, glass ware, etc.  The property is awesome as well—in the woods with deer commonly visiting the property.  I very much enjoyed my stay. Thank you, Kyle!"
25873321,283864293,2018-06-30,99961332,Ryan,"Awesome place to stay, nice and spacious. Great amenities."

25873321,286662186,2018-07-06,12118834,Amy,Peaceful and quiet in a forest setting yet so close to downtown. Nice crisp Oregon air. Open space feel. Super cute and decorated with a nice and clean look. Lots of goodies and snacks provided by host. Small kitchenette but had everything you needed. It’s almost private except the laundry room is shared with the guests in the ensuite.
25873321,292330759,2018-07-17,31752278,Vanessa,"Staying with Kyle was an exceptional experience. My partner and I stayed for ten nights when we were first moving to the area and Kyle was over-the-top kind and welcoming to us and our critters. His apartment is wonderfully put together and includes many thoughtful touches that made us feel cozy and at home. He was easy to communicate with, both before and during our stay,  and offered us great local tips on things to check out. And finally, his location is beyond amazing. We saw baby deer almost every day and woke up each morning to birds singing. It was overall a fantastic experience and we are grateful for having such an excellent host!"
25873321,295060260,2018-07-22,18776980,Johnny,"We had a wonderful stay at Kyle's place. The amenity that he provided is just amazing. A very comfortable bed, a upscale bathroom and a well stocked refrigerator are just among the few things that he provides. The property is secluded in the woods, yet only minutes away to city center. We had nice conversations, and he is just a great host. We wished we can stay longer! Thank you Kyle!"
25873321,296375354,2018-07-25,93569594,David,"Kyle’s place is spacious, relaxing, and includes many special touches that were welcome surprises after a long, hot day. Stay here if you are in the area!"
25873321,297936267,2018-07-28,178648796,Marie,"This is a very lovely place ! <br/>The accomodation is locates five minutes from the city, and yet on the middle of the woods ! <br/> We saw deers, chipmunks, squirrel and  nice birds. <br/><br/>The host  gave  us an excellent welcome ! He helped us for etablish our iterares,  he answered very quicly for helping us, he was very caring . <br/><br/>But he also knows how to be discreet and we felt comfortable,  and I felt especially good in the hammock !          :-)<br/><br/>The housing is very nice and spacious, impeccable,  and well equiped. <br/>The best adress in Oregon ! <br/><br/>Excellent adresse . L'hôte nous a réservé un excellent accueil : il nous a aidés à établir nos itinéraires, nous a donné des idées de sorties, de petites adresses pour nos courses, il a répondu rapidement à toutes nos petites questions.  Mais il a su aussi faire preuve de discrétion et nous laisser vivre notre vie .  <br/>Nous nous sommes sentis très à l'aise dans ce magnifique petit logement et nous y avons passé du bon temps !  J'ai aimé passer de longs moments de lecture dans le hamac . J'ai pu observer des écureuils , des chipmunks, de beaux oiseaux et même un chevreuil femelle  et son faon . <br/><br/> Le logement est situé à dix minutes à peine de la ville, et pourtant au milieu des bois .  <br/>"
25873321,304066849,2018-08-08,192483596,Lisa,"IMMACULATE!  This place is beautiful! Kyle is very nice, although I only saw him the first night. I truly enjoyed our stay and would stay here again. It is secluded and we enjoyed the deer and chipmunks that cane around to say “hi” each day. There isn’t a kitchen sink, but that wasn’t an issue for us. The bathroom sink was more than adaquate for our needs. The bed is extremely comfortable. The sheets feel very clean and soft. Kyle pays attention to many details and  has great decorative style. We loved this place! "
25873321,306608154,2018-08-12,40714923,Svetlana,Kyle’s place is a true gem! I wish we would have planned for a longer stay. Very comfortable bed and the place had everything you could possibly need. Great location to visit Willamette Valley. One of the best Airbnb experiences we have ever had. Don’t miss this place!
25873321,314441859,2018-08-26,79728045,Scott,"Feels like you are in the woods, yet still close to town. The space was very comfortable for two.  Kyle is a great host!"
25873321,318540384,2018-09-03,208565826,Sandra,"We will definitely keep this location on our 5 star list of sites.  We were there to help family and  Kyle was always prompt with a response whenever we had a question.  He was very accommodating, I casually mentioned my husband liked dark beer, when we arrived we found a very nice 6 pack in the fridge.  The apt was nice, clean, and quiet, and we will definitely will be back."
25873321,326196320,2018-09-21,111921725,Carolyn,"Kyle deserves more than 5 stars for his beautiful AirBnb and the amenities he provides.  The property is stunning and living area is beautifully decorated and so comfortable.  I particularly appreciated the great coffee selection!!  Kyle is welcoming, thoughtful and quick to help with anything you need.  I wish I had booked a longer stay."
25873321,327951321,2018-09-24,127768436,Ashley,"While staying at this beautiful location you are truly on vacation. Kyle insists on making your stay comfortable and care free. His home was pet friendly to our two well-behaved dogs. Kyle really thought about every detail you would want and many more you didn’t even know you’d want! We felt welcome and right at home from the moment we pulled in to the driveway. Kyle was quick to respond if we needed anything. I would recommend this location to anyone. You’re close enough to town to run to the store or park, but, when you’re “at home” it’s easy to forget that you’re not tucked away peacefully in the woods. There is a lot of “Oregon Charm” in the home and we can’t wait to stay again!"
25873321,328999893,2018-09-27,21369569,Melissa,"Kyle’s place is immaculate. Every attention to detail has been met. I cannot express how accommodating, kind and flexible Kyle was, in regards to my stay and my needs. This place is an incredible value."

We felt very at home in this space, which is extremely clean, comfortable and updated.  We appreciated the tasteful furnishings and the many extra welcoming touches.  Rentals don't get much better .... we would definitely come back!"
25873321,349208784,2018-11-16,149875581,Barry,"This is perfect in every way, especially if you value privacy. It is just minutes from downtown Salem. Everything is new, stylish, comfortable and charming. It is certainly an excellent bargain. Kyle sets the standard for an Air BNB host. You will not be disappointed."
25873321,350168942,2018-11-18,219845714,Daniel,Our stay with Kyle was exceptional. He didn't miss a thing from the cold wine to a great comfy bed. The space was exceptionally clean warm and friendly. So close to so many things it's a great place to stay in Salem.
25873321,353171882,2018-11-26,98986518,Suze,Kyle was a great host and the place was excellent.  We were well informed of what to expect upon arrival and throughout our stay.  The location is close to many of the places we wanted to go yet out of the way of main traffic.
25873321,354418303,2018-12-01,227872513,Kimberly,"This was a peaceful, quiet place with exceptional amenities.

Kyle was very responsive and an excetional host. We would definitely return!"
25873321,358529807,2018-12-14,60540452,Carol,"Kyle has a fabulous, stylish, comfortable luxurious Hideaway that I plan on visiting again!"
25873321,362142114,2018-12-25,98983942,Patty,Very comfortable private first floor home with everything you need.. we recommend staying here. Kyle checked with us to make sure we had everything we needed but we also had lots of privacy.  Such a beautiful area.. it’s like being in the country but still close to everything. Beautiful views from gorgeous big windows!!
25873321,362974287,2018-12-27,124884940,Kaitlin,"This place is AWESOME. Kyle was super helpful and hospitable, and we enjoyed our stay so much. Super cool spot with awesome amenities and nice location."

25873321,419397184,2019-03-03,8310177,Marcia,Perfect weekend for a man (my husband) and his dog to get away for the weekend. Quiet spot. Kyle was incredibly responsive and offered to stock the fridge with some beverages of our choosing. Very thoughtful!
25873321,421153209,2019-03-08,34006096,Tracy,Kyle’s place is amazing! Everything I expected and more. This will become my go to when in Salem.
25873321,456136807,2019-05-20,84522522,Michael,"A fantastic place in the woods and yet close to the city.  Kyle is really a special host.  We highly recommend staying at Antlerwood.  Easy parking.  Spacious living room/dining area,  separate bedroom and bathroom...all beautifully appointed.  Kyle went out of his way to make our weekend very special.  It's a ""must do"" if you are exploring the area."
25873321,459785607,2019-05-27,4759145,Joanne,"Impeccably clean, very spacious and extremely comfortable. Loved all the vintage cameras and the electric ""wood-burning"" stove. Kyle's place is both cozy and charming and a really great retreat for relaxing after a long day visiting with family. Tucked into the trees with deer roaming out front yet just a few minutes from downtown. Even though it's on the bottom floor underneath the main part of the house, it is incredibly quiet and private. We would come back here in a heartbeat next time we're in town!"
25873321,463038226,2019-06-02,247434701,Lon,A very nice place to stay at and I hope to stay there on future visits to my son’s family

He made sure everything was perfect for us.  Kyle has great recommendations of wineries.  Definitely will stay here again if we’re in the area."
25873321,485375082,2019-07-10,21132444,Molly,"Kyle's place was wonderful to stay at!  We had everything we needed, plus many thoughtful touches that were much appreciated (e.g., preferred beverages provided after Kyle inquired).  We would recommend his place to others and likely stay again!"
25873321,497654310,2019-07-28,96079301,Shirley,"Kyle has set the bar high for those wishing to be super hosts. He is a genuinely nice man and he has made may thoughtful  touches to his beautiful place and keeps improving it--he added beautiful flower boxes to the guest's outside space while we were there.  It's tucked in the woods so the deer, chipmunks and squirrels were frequent sights, but still close to town. We highly recommend staying at this very special AirBnB."

25873321,522996526,2019-09-02,114627706,Suzanne,"Kyle is the consummate host, and his place is the perfect hideaway for a couple wishing to spend time in South Salem.  The mini-apartment is situated in a woodsy area, is quite spacious and comfortable, and it’s nicely decorated.  Bonus—it’s pet-friendly, too!  It was the perfect place for us; we wanted to eat breakfast in but had no desire to cook lunch and dinner at the apartment.  The hot plate provided sufficed just fine for us.  The bathroom is spacious and beautifully decorated.  Kyle thought of everything, even down to the beer in the fridge and the bottle of Pinot Noir on the table.<br/><br/>One last note:  Most. Comfy. Bed. Ever."
25873321,533527518,2019-09-21,284236925,Connie,"Lovely secluded house, still very close to Salem. Plenty of space, special decor selections, pet friendly!"

The entire property is beautiful, and it’s in an amazing neighborhood. <br/><br/>Kyle is an amazing host as well. Super polite and accommodating, and left me with coffee and wine to enjoy during my stay! He is great at communicating with his guests, responds quickly. I even managed to lock myself out one night and he quickly got my text/call and let me in with no frustration, even though I know it was a pain. <br/><br/>I would stay here a hundred times more!"

Kyle made accommodations, which included even making a bed for my son (@sofa-bed)!<br/>I felt that he was the kindest host I ever experienced at Airbnb...<br/>The property was very well lit and easy to find at night; quiet, but still close to Salem..."
25873321,579462485,2019-12-20,138433163,Jennifer,"Kyle's Antlerwood Hollow provides a calm and peaceful setting for a weekend getaway, a staycation, or in my case a longer-term transitional residence as I moved cross-country to Oregon from Texas. This hidden gem is nestled amongst beautiful trees, hills, and winding roads and offers frequent sightings of deer. The place is sparkling clean, stylishly decorated, pet-friendly with approval, and minutes from restaurants and shops. It's easy to find and equipped with every amenity you could possibly need or want. Kyle has a delightful personality and energy and he ensures the comfort of his guests. He's very responsive and attentive to messages and needs. He even won over my sweet but skeptical pup. I would highly recommend a visit to Antlerwood Hollow. You'd think after 3 weeks there I wouldn't want to go back for a while, but I would certainly stay again for a weekend getaway or staycation."
25873321,581028879,2019-12-23,8498648,Kendra,"Kyle's place was perfect for my family to spend a couple of nights. The living area is spacious enough to hang out and play games, with a fold out couch and extra mattresses. There are plenty of amenities: parking, good lighting, Alexa for communication and music, even several options for making coffee. The location is better than expected, five minutes from restaurants in South Salem and near downtown as well. We would definitely stay again."
25873321,585389306,2019-12-31,210387770,Sheri,"Kyle’s place was amazing! Best Airbnb and better than any hotel we’ve ever stayed in! Every amenity was perfect and so many personal touches! We visit our family in Salem often, so I hope this place will be available each trip. The scenic trail behind the house is beautiful and was perfect to take our young grandsons on. Can’t say enough good things about Antlerwood! Thank you, Kyle!"
25873321,619514452,2020-03-17,148594369,Katrina,Clean and perfectly decorated space! Host was very quick with responding and accommodating!
25873321,627867197,2020-06-05,232473655,Shawn,"What an amazing little hidden paradise. Probably the nicest, cleanest, and best neighborhood around. Kyle will go out of his way to make sure you have everything you want. Deer and birds daily, chipmunk and rabbit too, say hello to my Stellar Jays while you’re there, I know they miss me."
25873321,629321923,2020-06-13,209812163,Christi,Kyle’s place was a wonderful and relaxing place to stay. He had a warm welcome waiting for us. His place is beautiful and was very clean. We enjoyed the beautiful and peaceful settings.
25873321,629760790,2020-06-14,2573813,Julia,I wish I could give 20 stars! Kyle's place was super clean and comfortable with thoughtful touches all over the place - including a personalized sign welcoming us and our dog by name! The space is well designed and stocked with everything one could possibly need. Kyle was extremely easy to communicate with and helped recommend a great place to go hiking. We are really looking forward to the next opportunity we have to take a trip down to Salem so that we can stay at Kyle's place again!
25873321,631314375,2020-06-21,25681,Laura,"Well decorated, spacious and good location. Hot water and water pressure was great. Loved the bed, so comfortable and nice bedding!!!<br/><br/>Heater stove in living area and portable heater fan in bedroom. <br/><br/>Washer and dryer worked well and nice to have access to. <br/><br/>Beer in fridge but I don’t drink beer so I didn’t partake but nice touch. There were many coffee choices as well. <br/><br/>Quiet downstairs unit. There are two steps up and over to go from living room to bedroom. Sink in bathroom or utility room, none in the kitchen just as advertised.<br/><br/>First day was warm so Kyle turned on AC so the Airbnb unit could cool down. Unit does not have its own control of temperature/AC.<br/><br/>As mentioned, AT&T service is not the greatest in the unit."
25873321,632355902,2020-06-26,98017460,Claudia,"Peace, a little heaven, relax... amazing place... near the city but out..."
25873321,633418329,2020-06-29,197421231,Jenner,Kyle is very thoughtful and accommodating and the suite is extremely clean and in a beautiful location.
25873321,635545736,2020-07-06,276839233,Marsha,"We typically don't stay in ""shared space"" airbnb's.  Don't miss this rustic, chic space for that reason! Kyle's place was comfortable and inviting and he was available by a simple text when we asked questions.  The coffee was amazing, with a touch of espresso! Kyle even had a case of water waiting for us when we arrived.   There was plenty of room for my husband and I.  We ate breakfast in and ate dinner at restaurants in town that Kyle suggested.  We were not disappointed.  Don't pass up this gem."
25873321,636573771,2020-07-10,58472629,Rene,This is a great find. Kyle thought of everything. Very comfortable stay!
25873321,637570228,2020-07-12,247456305,Shauna,This is a wonderful place to stay! Very cozy and comfortable. Much needed getaway. Will stay again!
25873321,639103363,2020-07-17,70005534,April,"This suite was perfect for our stay in Salem. The space was comfortable and clean, and the property is absolutely beautiful while still being accessible to a lot in Salem. Kyle was very welcoming and hospitable."
25873321,639523703,2020-07-18,113436813,Delaney,"Space was great! Lots of privacy despite being a “shared” space - barely! Loves that dogs are welcomed, great outdoor space, great bathroom supplies and had local beer for us in the fridge."
25873321,640581910,2020-07-20,331569944,Dodi,Kyle has a wonderful place to relax...a great assortment of movies..nice computer table...extremely comfortable bed with soft pillows...a dual head shower with nice soft towels...the place also has multiple sitting areas and hammocks where you can relax and take in nature...will definitely return
25873321,653950000,2020-08-20,100262186,Portia,"This stay was INCREDIBLE! Kyle treated both myself and my dogs like family. I couldn’t ask for more. His AirBNB was beautiful and incredibly cozy. All the amenities you could imagine and MORE! Sweet touches like beer in the fridge and coffee for the morning! <br/><br/>The surrounding woods and wildlife were magical. We saw deer multiple times, rabbits, squirrels, the works.<br/><br/>Kyle went above and beyond for us and I’ll feel forever grateful. When the California fires were raging and I needed a few more days to crash, Kyle was more than willing to help me out.<br/><br/>This stay will wow you beyond belief, no matter what your expectations are. Adult friendly, kid friendly, and dog friendly :) Enjoy yourself!"
25873321,710729117,2020-11-22,8187914,Teresa,"We can't say enough about Kyle's excellent communication and his attentiveness to our needs during our 2-1/2 month stay. The Airbnb space is very comfortable plus the location is only minutes to downtown and Minto-Brown Island Park, a place that we loved going for walks and bike riding. We especially appreciated being able to bring our cat with us as we were moving from another state to Oregon. We give Kyle an A+ for his friendliness and kindness.  We would highly recommend staying at Antlerwood Hollow - a place that feels like you're on retreat in the woods. Thank you ❤️"
25873321,713918881,2020-12-06,5469302,Molly,"Kyle’s place is lovely, comfortable, clean, and all that you would hope for in an air bnb. We will stay here again."
25873321,714569597,2020-12-10,175890116,Michelle,Amazing stay! Kyle helped me build a fire to roast s'mores. BEAUTIFUL home...can't wait for my next visit.
25873321,715436438,2020-12-13,86587041,Stacey,"Antlerwood Hollow is full of the little touches that a traveler needs and appreciates.  The property feels rural, but is minutes from some of the best amenities Salem has to offer."
25873321,719201871,2020-12-28,356999250,Connie,The only thing you need to bring is your toothbrush.  Just about everything is there and even more.  Highly recommend this place. Like I told him if we come back I’ll check to see what dates are available and will plan our trip back to Salem around his free time
25873321,721121898,2021-01-02,311931639,Fabio,The best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had!
25873321,724457643,2021-01-15,23721494,Kirsten,"Antlerwood Hollow was one of my all-time favorite short-term rentals. As an artist/writer working remotely during the pandemic, I've been feeling so claustrophobic in city apartments, unable to work in coffee shops like I always have. At Antlerwood Hollow, I delighted in all the different places to work -- desk, kitchen table, couch, comfy armchair, reading chair in the bedroom, even Adirondack chairs outside when the weather permitted. The space is much larger than it appears in photos, and the setting is gorgeous. Kyle was an incredibly kind and helpful host, going above and beyond a number of times for me and my little pup. I stayed nearly two weeks, and would have stayed longer! A forest dream-come-true."
25873321,730622221,2021-02-12,46567270,Tyler,"This is an awesome space, in a beautiful part of Salem. Kyle was very accommodating."
25873321,731342114,2021-02-14,40444498,Dana,"Very cozy and welcoming space. Kyle gives lots of personal touches that make that space feel like home. Unfortunately we were there during a freak ice storm, but we were well cared for and our needs were all met! Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to get out of the city but still have all the amenities close by!"
25873321,736129015,2021-03-03,271365568,Pamela,Lovely place in the woods but very. Lose to downtown Salem and wineries.
25873321,737384080,2021-03-07,34752465,Rachel,Felt like being a guest in someone’s home but with all the amenities you would find in a hotel all in a beautiful setting. We will definitely be back.
25873321,739212356,2021-03-14,331569944,Dodi,"Kyle is an amazing host!!   We have stayed at Antler Wood  Hollow twice now and have been very pleased.   His place is amazingly clean and inviting.   It has a very comfortable bed.  It is nice and warm and off of the beaten path, and has an amazing living room with a great movie collection.   We have already booked our 3rd vacation here.   Kyle is a super nice guy and could easily charge double for this beautiful forest paradise"
25873321,758447238,2021-05-15,141880564,Catherine,Great location! Such a lovely place to stay!
25873321,762395666,2021-05-24,186275293,Rachel,"A beautiful home, amazing amenities, we really didn’t want to leave!! Kyle’s home is in the perfect location. You feel like you’re in the woods but your only minutes from Salem, not to mention only an hour from Portland and the coast!! So glad we stayed here and most certainly would again!!"
25873321,765448634,2021-06-01,128971904,Randol,Nice one bedroom apartment surrounded by hills and trees.
25873321,766339845,2021-06-04,1692712,Valerie,Very clean space & quiet neighborhood. Close to town & hiking. Great TV too!
25873321,768693037,2021-06-10,399728820,Karen,"A great place to stay in the Salem area. Close to the city but a quiet, secluded setting. <br/>Kyle’s a friendly host. <br/>Would definitely recommend!"
25873321,770183374,2021-06-13,347204638,Liane,"Kyle is a very gracious host!  Antlerwood Hollow is in a peaceful, retreat-like setting!  Deer walk by, birds are chirping, trees are everywhere! We would definitely come back!"
25873321,389129489019283112,2021-06-20,247434701,Lon,"Our second stay and it was great. Quiet, peaceful and a change from Hawaii. Would always be our first choice when visiting family in Salem."
25873321,392739353370391457,2021-06-25,272299193,Lisa,"Comfortable, affordable and convenient to Salem and Dallas.  Kyle is a great host who communicates well, making sure you are comfortable.  He responded to all questions before and during our stay in a very timely manner."
25873321,398596909160952887,2021-07-03,100262186,Portia,"This AirBNB is insanity. I literally couldn’t ask for anything more, Kyle has it all. Any question you have or service you need will most likely be fulfilled if you bring it up. Plus the place is just beautiful. Tons of wildlife, especially pretty much tame deer that eat, drink, and wander right in front of your windows. I’m a return visitor, and I will be for years. I have two dogs and he is just fantastic with them. I feel completely at ease and so well taken care of. If I could give him 10 stars I would!"
25873321,400075511076362742,2021-07-05,397033018,Lisa,"Location, location, location.  I am a solo traveling female and wanted to feel safe in my lodgings.  Kyle's place is perfect!  While it is secluded,  I felt safe up the hill in the 1st level apartment space.  It is larger than it looks in the pictures.  Deer are daily visitors with the feeding bowl within view of the large windows in the living room.  Very quiet and peaceful at night.  Loved the bathrobe provided!  A/C was wonderful on those hot days.<br/><br/>Day trips to  Minto-Brown Island Park just minutes away was great for walking the dogs.  Cyclist would love that park!  I also visited Nelson Park right down the road.  A hilly pathway around the park was great exercise and very kid friendly."
25873321,402959360579314473,2021-07-09,398826249,Brittany,This place is incredible! Everything was clean and incredibly comfortable. The view is great too! It’s perfectly place near enough to everything but you still get the quiet peaceful feeling when you are there. Would definitely stay again! Thank you for the great stay Kyle!
25873321,406572590004174539,2021-07-14,4868364,Vanessa,"Kyle’s place is super cozy, clean, and has more than you’ll ever need! Would 100% recommend staying here!"
25873321,413036575697358334,2021-07-23,96079301,Shirley,"What a fun and wonderful place to stay! This is our 2nd time here and it just keeps getting better. Kyle is very thoughtful and kind— even the deer and rabbits know this. He has indoor activities—nice TV, books, movies, games. We highly recommend staying here."
25873321,415979232822337931,2021-07-27,35249924,Sue,"What an amazing place! I already have made another reservation to go back. Kyle is an amazing host. Place was really clean, kitchen had everything you need and the bed was soooo comfortable. The outdoor area was just the relaxing place I needed at the end of the day. This is by far the best AirBnb place I have stayed in."
25873321,419615931882471798,2021-08-01,160727637,Nikole,"Clean, nice amenities and beds were reasonably comfy."
25873321,421800462502515467,2021-08-04,4759145,Joanne,"This was our second time staying at Kyle's place, and we may have loved it even more than the first. So spacious, comfortable, well equipped, and perfectly nestled in the woods but just 5 mins from town. There were a few changes and additions since our last stay that made it even better. I think the only thing missing is a kitchen sink and a full-length mirror, but everything else is downright perfect, and Kyle is an excellent host who always greets you with wine and/or beer. We'll be back!"
25873321,423963596707815934,2021-08-07,32160436,Stacey,So cute and comfortable. Loved looking out into the trees every morning with a short drive into town.
25873321,436223519531530404,2021-08-24,195468210,Mark,Our stay far exceeded our expectations. We are moving here and needed an extended stay until we closed on our house. Beautiful location with hiking trails and deer. Very clean and had everything we needed for our extended stay. We highly recommend Kyle.
25873321,444232037536833665,2021-09-04,35511694,Megan,A nicely appointed comfortable dwelling in gorgeous surroundings. Extra nice bathroom. The host is very welcoming and extremely laid back! Check in and check out are so simple and he’s really responsive with questions! I rented this for my in laws when they came to town and they were thrilled and want to stay there again.
25873321,460144059701345975,2021-09-26,410850298,Emily,Such a comfy space with anything you could ask for. Settled back in the trees for a relaxing time. I would have lived there if I could have.
25873321,480430693845517681,2021-10-24,5831763,Daniel & Ashley,"Stayed for a month and loved it!!! A beautiful, peaceful home. We both worked full time and the WiFi was excellent even with video streaming. Kyle was extremely accommodating and responsive.  Would absolutely stay again."
25873321,497184620483536883,2021-11-16,88389117,Molly,"Kyle’s place is excellent. My husband and I stayed here with our 11 month old, while visiting family in the area. It was the perfect little space, with everything we could need available to us. The location is great, close to restaurants, hiking trails, and parks to play for our little one. The property feels very safe, clean and cozy… exactly what we were looking for. <br/><br/>Kyle was great with communication and quick response. He was very accommodating of our schedule and unique arrival/departure needs. We wish we could have stayed longer. 10/10 recommend! We hope to book a trip here again soon."

25873321,587737249154431381,2022-03-21,95722783,Teresa,A really nice place that was conveniently located. Be careful driving at night as I had several close encounters with deer.

For us the location was perfect.  Easy access to freeway for day tripping to Portland and surrounding cities for visiting family and friends... furnishings were great....comfy bed, good size living area and a huge shower with two shower heads..... nicely done and very comfortable!  We will definitely be returning to enjoy the new outside pergola and new landscaping!"

We are very grateful to have spent a few nights here and to have a good place for our kids and our pup to stretch out. We had fun watching deer and squirrels outside at night!"
25873321,679090260673935150,2022-07-25,129292786,Bryan,The location set just on the outskirts of the city was wonderful. Scenic and lots of wildlife. We saw deer every day. The lower level which we rented was immaculate and quiet. Close proximity to an amazing park with paved trails that go on and on. I would highly recommend this place to anyone coming to the Salem/Eugene/Portland area.
25873321,683363356426047173,2022-07-31,13439755,Erica,"This was one of the most unique and cozy stays we've had. Highly, highly recommend!"

25873321,693515406520849349,2022-08-14,206799840,Danno,"It was an outstanding experience! It’s such a lovely home, in a beautiful setting. We love the marriage of modern convenience and country rusticism. Most importantly, we appreciate how helpful and welcoming Kyle is. This home really helped create an incredible setting for a wonderful weekend getaway."

Perfect place for a getaway with our pups (thank you for allowing dogs)...close to parks and restaurants. Wonderful host...he was away from the home when we arrived, but checked in with us to see if we needed anything and responded very quickly when we had a couple of questions. <br/>Thank you Kyle for sharing  your beautiful home! We hope to be back soon!"

We really enjoyed our stay and I only wish it could have been longer so I could relax in the many hammocks and listen to the birds. It’s rare that I wish I had more time to spend just lounging around my Airbnb! This is much more than a place to crash - it’s more like a temporary home."
25873321,710184238812128732,2022-09-06,127742642,Jeff,"Think twice about staying here if you like quiet. Between the road noise, the mechanicals noise and sounds from upstairs it wasn’t for us easy to sleep."
25873321,749373867047783750,2022-10-30,481591127,Riley,Best air bnb I’ve stayed at and I’ve stayed at quite few
25873321,754471567308021071,2022-11-06,460624954,Deanna,It was very clean and spacious. The pictures don’t do it justice. There is a super cute reading nook in the bedroom that I very much enjoyed. There are extra blankets and heaters available.  Kyle was kind enough to let us check-in early so we didn’t have to stay in the rain. Downtown is only a 15 min away. I highly recommend booking this location!
25873321,758056873564062465,2022-11-11,45081672,Laurie,"Very clean, cozy and a great value."
25873321,760286858659797141,2022-11-14,324130499,Natalie,"My first Airbnb and I know I was absolutely spoiled with Kyle’s place! This place is a gem, it’s a perfect getaway to relax and have a staycation. It would also be a perfect hub for discovering Oregon too! He was so accommodating and sweet to my puppy.  I would love to stay here again. We had a wonderful time! The amenities were above and beyond and the decorations were so cute and cozy. The bed and couch were so comfy as well!"
25873321,766794060144525204,2022-11-23,100945795,Richard,"Kyle's place is extremely comfortable.  We were very comfortable and safe.  Kyle provides many ways to manage the temperature in the space.  The kitchen area was easy to use and keep clean.  The bedroom was very private and cozy, with a reading nook, a nice closet area, and a bathroom with a shower with dual heads.  We hope the space is available for our next trip to Salem."
25873321,769013911738761044,2022-11-26,2173383,Adrianna,"We can't thank Kyle enough for how kind and adaptable he was throughout our booking process and throughout our stay. He welcomed us with a sweet sign at the front door and always responded quickly and thoughtfully to messages. The location was in a beautiful wooded area while just a short drive to Salem proper. The space itself had so many little touches to make it feel like home...from books on the shelf to a full K-cup coffee rack to plenty of dishes and linens. We did most of our cooking and dining out, since we have family in the area, so didn't miss the kitchen sink or oven. When we did have a few things to wash, it was easy to use the laundry room sink and the washtub/drying rack Kyle provides. Our family of four (well, five with our dog!) absolutely LOVED our stay and will look for Kyle's place first the next time we stay in Salem."

27546916,497715710,2019-07-28,46768249,Midori,"I loved everything about the decor and felt the owner had so much thought and care into all the extras. It felt like she chose everything as if she were living there herself. She didn’t skimp out on quality from sheets to dimmable lights throughout, remote controlled flickering candles, to well chosen vintage decor in every perfect nook of the house.  I felt inspired everywhere I looked. If I needed something, it was available-  from an extra fan because I love white noise when I sleep, a pen in the kitchen drawer when I needed to write a check, to a square skillet for bacon I needed to fry for breakfast. It truly felt like a home away from home."

I’ve been to MANY bnbs but Sarita’s bnb has one of thee most generously stocked pantries with many different seasonings and even honey for the tea!

30340285,355793763,2018-12-05,185958040,Jazmine,"Caleb and Keely were very gracious people. The apartment was beautiful, clean and had everything you could need. It was truly a home away from home. This made is so much easier on us during our travels and gave us a nice break to relax and not have to worry about improvising or spending extra money on eating out. Very cozy and well insulated. Great privacy and definitely one of our favorite Airbnb spots. The cleaning fee is super steep but I was able to get Airbnb to cover it so that we could save some gas money til we traveled to our next job and got paid again. Otherwise it's a great deal. The hosts were willing to waive the cleaning for us, knowing we were a little tight on money that week. I would not expect this to happen as a regular thing for customers. I just wanted to include this part of our story to show what Wonderful people they are. I didn't pay attention to the total like I should have before confirming my purchase for the night and even though they have the least restrictive possible cancellation policy, I still would have been out even more money and not be able to afford a place to stay for the night. They would've been effected negatively too, as far as bad marks on Airbnb's end and could have even been out $100 themselves with the way their policies work, had they changed or cancelled anything for us. (Which is ridiculous for them to penalize the hosts like that.) I just thought it was really great of them to offer to pay me back the $20 cleaning fee in cash, in the event that we checked out early. They did not have to do that and I was very thankful for their offer. Luckily, as I stated earlier, I was able to contact Airbnb and explain my situation to them and they covered the cleaning fee to ensure we had a positive experience with them. It isn't often that you'll find people who genuinely care and are willing to help perfect strangers. Again, please don't expect this or try to take advantage of them, just know that you'll have some amazing hosts who are good people while staying there. Definitely recommend!"
30340285,356282790,2018-12-07,174239861,Cindy,Totally recommend staying here. Plenty of little extras that made my stay a great one.

30340285,359328071,2018-12-16,228390956,Mary,"Caleb and Keely have a clean, stylish space that is welcoming and suited with all the amenities.  We were in town for a Celebration of Life and considered the space our home away from home.  It was comfortable and Caleb was responsive and accommodating to our requests.  I recommend staying with them if you are in the Salem area!"
30340285,359716494,2018-12-17,210552902,Isabeau,Absolutely loved staying in this beautiful and stylish space. Caleb and Keely were quick at responding to messages and very accommodating.

We accidentally locked ourselves out of the place and Caleb was there within a phone call to unlock the place for us. It was nice to have the coffee maker, pots, and pans and a stove to make food in the morning. I wish I could give their place more than 5 stars. Perfect, cozy, and comfortable."

30340285,446565676,2019-05-01,18468232,Alyssa,"Caleb and Keely’s place is comfortable and clean! They were clear with instructions for how to get in with the keyless entry and parking, they offered restaurant suggestions, and have Netflix/Hulu/amazon on their tv. I liked being close to downtown where I had my work meetings. For being a basement, they were very quiet at night. I would definitely recommend!"

30340285,451430474,2019-05-11,27464520,Anita,"Caleb and Keely’s apartment is exactly as pictured - cute and clean!  But pictures don’t capture all of the special touches they have added to make your stay as pleasant as possible. All we can say is, “It was our pleasure.” Thanks again."
30340285,454602302,2019-05-18,193045342,Alena,"I was disappointed. Parking was difficult when I first arrived since other cars were occupying the spots next to the house because the hosts were having a gathering.  They were sitting at the kitchen table when I arrived and one host stared straight at me, then turned around. I never received as much as a text to acknowledge I was there or welcome me, or ask if I needed anything as I settled in. If they weren't on property looking right at me, I wouldn't hve thought this as strange. Then the noise started. Nowhere in the ad does it say you can hear upstairs noise, but you can hear it VERY CLEARLY, and after driving 8 hours, starting at 6 am, all I wanted to do was sleep... which I couldn't do. I was on the phone with my wife complaining about the noise when I got a message from the hosts apologizing for all the noise (still no welcome) I thought the timing was weird, especially for it to be the fist communication, as though my conversation had been heard while I was in my bedroom. I didn't want to deal with any drama so I decided to call airbnb the next day.  The next morning I went to shower and found ants and flies in the bathroom, both species were small but their presence at all was disappointing. When I contacted Airbnb about a resolution,  they said the host was offering me $20 and they would not refund me the cleaning fee for an unclean accomodation. The host could have avoided this true and honest review if they had played fairly. Good luck with this listing"
30340285,456107990,2019-05-20,118720540,Karen,Great location!! Looks exactly as pictures.  We were in town for our daughter's law school graduation at Willamette.  Super close to everything.  We ate out but the kitchen had the basic so we could have  cooked instead.  Would definitely stay again.

30340285,517871712,2019-08-25,213624901,Cheryl,"Very comfortable apartment, quite spacious, tastefully decorated.  Kitchen is nicely stocked, full size fridge and stove and small dishwasher make this very convenient for an extended stay. Bed and sofa are very comfortable and space is quite quiet.  Location is convenient to downtown and commercial areas and just a couple blocks from a large park."

Caleb and Keely were extremely accommodating throughout the whole stay and were always available if I needed anything. I will definitely return to their place if I find myself in Salem again!
30340285,600025677,2020-01-31,284250857,Mirijam,Wonderful apartment just as in the pictures. <br/>Very friendly and helpful family. <br/>Whenever back in Salem I would definitely choose it again.
30340285,619917216,2020-03-19,70697350,John,"Caleb and Keely's place was amazing. It was exactly as pictured, and felt even better than described! It's in the basement of their home, but it's so comfortable and cozy, it doesn't feel anything like a basement. Parking is on the side of their house. There are windows in the kitchen and bedroom, so it isn't dark and gloomy all the time. Their kitchen had everything you would need for a stay with regards to pots, pans, utensils, dishes, etc. The living room is very cozy, with an electric fireplace to make sure you stay nice and warm during the cold months. The bathroom was clean, the shower was great, and they provided everything you might need during the stay. The bedroom had a nice drawer to put your belongings with a small closet to hang your clothes. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable and made it easy to fall asleep every night. Overall, Caleb and Keely's place was amazing. Everything was great, and we easily felt like home after we were able to get some groceries to stock the fridge. Overall, I would recommend people staying here whether it's for a short, or long-term stay."
30340285,623094845,2020-04-25,331050741,Jose,"The stay was amazing, perfect for a stay that allows you to get the feeling of a home without putting everything you own in a duffle bag. Great neighborhood which allowed for beautiful walks and near numerous groceries options."

30340285,650251824,2020-08-12,46725166,Devin,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Caleb and Keely's place for about two months this summer and had a great experience! We were a bit apprehensive about living in a basement, but the place is really well lit, and since it's so close to Bush Park it's easy to get outside. Also, Caleb and Keely redid the backyard while we were here, so now the backyard is a beautiful place to hang out and they were very gracious about sharing that space with us. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the utensils and cookware necessary to make just about anything. The bed and couch were very comfortable. The WiFi was fast and reliable. My girlfriend was taking an online class for the duration of our stay and never had a Zoom call drop. Caleb was always very available for any question we had, and though their family was upstairs, it was never really a bother to hear the kiddos running around. It was too bad that this summer everything was closed, because the location is really great, only about a 20 minute walk or quick drive to downtown. Overall, great little apartment for a short or long term stay!"
30340285,705984438,2020-11-01,204119433,Jennifer,Was a nice experience staying at Caleb and Keely’s place
30340285,719212787,2020-12-28,79588783,Eial,"This place is fantastic. I stayed here with 2 kids for a month and a half. The apartment is well designed even for a small place and makes the most out of the space available. At some point we even had several guests over and it still didn't feel crowded. Caleb and Keely really helped with all the travel adjustments and having a newborn. The place is located in a quite place in town but close to a lot of key points of interest, like grocery shopping, a really nice park just around the corner, and other places I needed like the hospital. Overall, during these times it's a good place to stay at for long term, very affordable. Thank you Caleb and Keely for being such wonderful hosts :)"
30340285,735533045,2021-02-28,73688102,Caitlin,A perfect basement apartment. Has everything you would need for a long stay. Lovely neighborhood near a beautiful park. <br/><br/>Caleb and Keely are so kind and truly went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable during my stay.

Caleb & Keely were always available if we needed anything  and were very accommodating with our crazy schedule. We really enjoyed the location and took daily walks around beautiful Bush Park almost daily as it is just a block away. The neighborhood is very nice with beautiful flowers abounding! We are in Salem often and look forward to staying again soon!
30340285,418871084408996311,2021-07-31,384656296,Susan,Caleb and Keely offer a perfect space for a staycation. The apartment space is clean and well equipped with all that is needed during a stay.

The space was cozy and had anything we could have needed for our stay (even some board games to play!) They we’re fantastic hosts, very kind, and easy to communicate with. Check in was a breeze and the apartment was very private from the rest of the home. I definitely recommend staying with them however long your stay."
30340285,553692496476837596,2022-02-02,429087337,Mark,Great cozy space with everything you need for a month or longer. The location is pretty nice and is close to stores and other activities. The space is very easy to get to as well.
30340285,622532627555688603,2022-05-08,258297864,Kara Lei,"All the accommodations for a long-term stay including a washer and dryer. Great communication and fast responses with Caleb. Rarely hear the upstairs unit. Also, the Internet was able to handle working from home and various zoom calls."

Everything was so clean when I got there and I had everything I needed in the kitchen, and I like to cook. Comfortable bed and living room. The neighborhood is so cute and safe. Bush park is a close walk and it's beautiful. But even more beautiful is their backyard which they happily shared with me and got to take a few meeting from the garden. I hope to come stay again!"
30340285,752977124900893979,2022-11-04,200509894,Viet,Great place to stay and nice neighborhood!

Anything we needed as far as amenities go were all provided especially items for our pup that we brought along which was a nice surprise. Glad we came across this bungalow and would definitely stay again next time we’re in town."
30442754,366542303,2019-01-02,26650994,Alison,"We enjoyed staying in the bungalow. The location is very convenient and within short walking distance to breweries, breakfast joints, and parks. The space is new, very clean, nicely decorated, and the hosts provided thoughtful touches. They were responsive and gave good tips (while respecting privacy). The fenced in yard was also a bonus. I recommend a stay!"
30442754,405866933,2019-01-27,6108887,Susan,"Great little place centrally located so everything is close.  Cozy and comfortable, the house is private and comfortable.  It's hard to find a place with an enclosed yard and it makes it so much easier to have the pup with you.  Great neighborhood to walk in."
30442754,415485652,2019-02-22,62991613,Sarah,"Aimee and Bill have done a great job of creating a private retreat with a beautiful aesthetic. This is a perfect amount of space for a couple. The neighborhood is close to amenities and downtown Salem -easy access to anything you need. We didn’t bring our dog, but this would have been an ideal set up for traveling with a pet! Thanks for a lovely stay - we will definitely come back next time we are in Salem!"

Really fun tiny house experience and so wonderful to have my dog with me.  Great location with so many options for eating out.  It was quiet and private with my own yard for my dog.  Great place to stay and explore Salem!
30442754,449008160,2019-05-05,224413810,Kathryn,"This place is great for a family with a young child. We put a pack-n-play in the living area and the fenced in yard is perfect for a toddler to run around. VERY clean, which is also nice for little hands that like to get into even hard to reach places to clean! A very nice stay overall."
30442754,456157278,2019-05-20,236737967,Crystal,"Quiet and comfortable. The cottage was stocked with coffee and a full sized coffee pot, plus some snacks. I would definitely stay there when visiting Salem again."
30442754,459068910,2019-05-26,8352959,Charles,"We went to Salem for the gardens.  Specifically, the iris gardens.  Bill & Aimee's place was conveniently located both the gardens and for local dining.  It was a great place to stay for a long weekend."
30442754,463635704,2019-06-03,63132413,Ashley,Cute little home!! No real fridge or living quarters!! Made it tough to keep food available
30442754,466890195,2019-06-09,70193857,Allison,"Aimee and Bill’s sweet cottage is the perfect home base to explore Salem. The home is located minutes from downtown and only 15 minutes from numerous wineries. There are thoughtful touches throughout like the doggie amenities, snacks, grill, extra cozy blankets and toiletries. There is a ton of privacy as well. The cottage is accessed through a separate side entrance, and there is a portion of the yard that has been fenced off from the rest of the yard. Aimee and Bill are exceptionally welcoming hosts to boot! We had a very pleasant stay."
30442754,472017332,2019-06-18,63492694,Michele,Bill and Aimee's cottage was perfect for what I needed.  It was clean and located in a quiet neighborhood
30442754,475795682,2019-06-24,16439432,Mary,"I seriously want to keep this place a secret, as it is just such a great location and they have it set up perfectly--but they had everything I needed/wanted, it is clean; and I will definitely stay again in the future!  I hadn't noticed that it was 'dog friendly', and I don't have a dog and I mentioned to them that, as a person who doesn't have dogs, I noticed that there isn't even a 'dog smell'.  So best of both worlds--as, though I'm not a 'dog person' myself, I'm glad there is a friendly place for them!  Thank you so much Bill and Aimee!"
30442754,484324748,2019-07-08,35168930,Maribel,"Perfect place for a small family! Their little home has everything you need within reach. Home is nicely organized and very modern. Only downfall was the wifi, but we only used it for the kiddos when we got back from being out all day. Thank you, we enjoyed our stay."
30442754,488284849,2019-07-14,33520512,Karen,"This place is adorable! It’s perfect for two people. There’s a small common area, a cute bedroom, and Bill and Aimee will make sure you are well taken care of!"

30442754,498472907,2019-07-29,24476277,Ashley,A cute little house that was perfect for our weekend getaway.
30442754,502643177,2019-08-04,154105331,Jennifer,"We have two small dogs, this fenced in little bungalow was absolutely perfect for our baby girls! The hosts really thought of everything in the house but we are pretty easy to please. The house was designed beautifully, warm, inviting, and comfortable. They have a mini fridge/freezer and portable ac which was sooooo needed and perfect! (I saw a heater and lots of extra blankets too so it will be fabulous in the winter as well) Check in was so easy! No coordinating with someone to try to make it there at an exact appointment time. Stress free and everything was ready and waiting when we got there! Great place to land for the weekend. Great location to all things you need. Wine country wasn’t too far of a trek and if you want to come home to the yard to drink a bottle with nice chairs and a fire pit table, that was great too! I loved the ambiance of the twinkle lights when we arrived, it was a breath of fresh air from a long work week. All in all we will be back, it was perfect!"
30442754,508338655,2019-08-12,62015698,Shanthi,"Great host for dog lovers, with a lovely yard with grass and a good setup for dogs (doggy bed, food/water bowls). Not a great setup for cooking, but there is a hot plate and microwave. Very quick to get from the AirBNB to downtown restaurants and attractions, and you can walk to get groceries."
30442754,515341917,2019-08-22,83156920,Sarah,"Very clean and nicely appointed. Tight space for 3 large bodies but great for solo, couple or plus small child."
30442754,517685997,2019-08-25,235991623,Mercer,"Cute little hidden bungalow in Salem. It was fairly small but it was perfect for 2 people and 2 pups. Very relaxing. I appreciate how dog friendly they are. Dog bed and dog bowls were provided. Nice yard as well, however the fence is a bit tall and both of the dogs were able to escape. Friendly hosts!"
30442754,522192052,2019-09-01,113917127,Kiana,"This location is perfect! So close to downtown and pretty much everything you need. The bungalow was perfect for two people and a furry friend. They provided dog bowls and a dog bed if you need it! The backyard is so adorable and is perfect if you want to keep your dog back there and watch them run around. We had one single complaint and it is that when we went to lay down for the night we noticed a good amount of dog hair. We read the house rules and it said no dogs on the furniture so we complied but someone else did not. I also don’t know if that means the sheets hadn’t been cleaned prior to us coming which gave me a weird feeling when laying in the bed. Other than that, this place was very nice 😊"

30442754,535995361,2019-09-25,18472574,Miranda R,"What an adorable bungalow!  Aimee and Bill had it all decorated and set up quite comfortably, including some fall decor for the season- it made it feel extra homy.<br/>All things were thought of to make your stay easy- coffee, wine, snacks- and towels and blankets, my friend was excited over the Q-Tips 😉.<br/>Even a dog bed and doggy bowls for my little one.  <br/>There were chairs and a BBQ outside and a small fire pit- with your own little fenced in yard area.<br/>Bedding was nice and clean.<br/>It was a great location and easy to find.<br/>Great hosts- and they came to greet us and be sure we had what we needed- and even gave us tips for dinner and a winery.<br/>Thank you for being great hosts!<br/>I was here on business but had a friend with me who was babysitting my dog while I was at my event and the two of us had a lot of stuff - but still the bungalow fit us and was cozy!"

Perfect for Willamette parents to visit :)  The bed was super comfy and Aimee even provided an additional heater for those chilly nights. We loved the outdoor fire pit for evening relaxing.  We used the crock pot to make a soup from thugs we bought at the Saturday Farmers Market downtown! It was so delicious. <br/>Thanks for everything!!!!!
30442754,559346316,2019-11-03,165497869,Keely,"This was a cute little space, in a nice location in town. Great communication by hosts, with quick responses."

30442754,607490063,2020-02-17,335772158,Andrew,"Was a overall good trip! No major complaints! Small things here and there like some of the dishes being slightly dirty, but besides that was a great place to stay!"

30442754,627378803,2020-06-01,255231529,Jane,"This is a lovely little place. It was so nice to have a big yard to hang out in. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was spotless. The Roku TV was a nice touch. The location is perfect (close to town but still very quiet). The hosts were very responsive and responded immediately to our queries. The kitchen is not really a full kitchen with just a hot plate and only one pot so if you want to cook full meals, it is a bit of a challenge. It is a bit small for the price but nice place especially if you have a dog. The yard is great as long as it’s good weather."
30442754,628376342,2020-06-07,8190466,Amanda,"This place is a great find! Bill and Aimee have thought of everything and more. This bungalow has incredible amenities and is very well located in town. We loved having our own space that we could bring our pup to, and the private backyard space was a fantastic surprise. We will definitely keep this place in mind for next time."
30442754,631726447,2020-06-23,138949331,Jd,"Safe, quiet and secure. A great space for dogs, my dogs loved the yard. The owners are very friendly and communicate well.  Simple access to the house. The space is very clean...immaculate! Keep in mind that the house is only about 300sqf. It’s enough space for 2 adults and small dogs..maybe small kids...3 adults would be very crowded."
30442754,633878214,2020-07-01,67116292,Judy,Quiet area and has sufficient space to be comfortable.  Easy access in and out with privacy in the back yard.  Worked really well for traveling with our dog.
30442754,635997641,2020-07-08,50751069,Erik,Cozy little spot near central Salem. 45 minutes out to trail of ten falls. Super cute place that has everything you need. Highly recommend
30442754,637540929,2020-07-12,56428665,Emily,"Great cottage, fast communication, perfect location and pet friendly with private yard!"
30442754,643455573,2020-07-27,35193957,Linda,"Bill and Aimee’s place is comfortable for 2 people, it would be a bit cramped with more. It’s on a quiet street which is nice with a parking space for guests. Bill and Aimee were quick to respond but we did not meet them."
30442754,644832433,2020-07-31,379459,Andy,It’s all about the yard. Thanks for the great retreat!
30442754,647036215,2020-08-05,33862452,Annie,A charming and chic back house--a private big yard in front helped to open up the space! Great hosts as well!
30442754,654930386,2020-08-22,223353428,Tierra,"Would totally stay here again! Cute private space, comfy bed, & it was the only place on our vacation that had its own fenced yard for our dog. It was so nice! Very close to everything in Salem. Aimee was very nice & gave us so many good recommendations for things to do, places to eat, etc."
30442754,657974840,2020-08-29,126830592,Liz,"We were in town visiting elderly parents, and due to covid precautions wanted a separate place to stay. The cottage is cute and tidy. Well laid out, perfect for 2. The windows all have screens and provide good cross breeze (there is also a fan and a mini a/c unit, we didn't need either). Plenty of privacy to have the door open to the fully fenced yard. Kitchen is efficient and has the basics, bed was extremely comfortable. Self check-in/out was easy. Would recommend."
30442754,661911627,2020-09-07,330074638,Katie,"Cute little place to stay, close to everything, comfortable bed!"

30442754,726689960,2021-01-24,333653404,Sarah,"Very cozy and centrally located! Just enough space for two people, any more than that and it would be quite crowded. Thanks for a quiet and relaxing retreat!"
30442754,748928267,2021-04-15,46567270,Tyler,"We stayed with Bill and Aimee for more than two months and we couldn't have asked for a better place. It is a small space but 2 people were able to live comfortably, it is very cozy. the enclosed private yard is a huge plus and the area is beautiful. <br/><br/>We are pretty private people and Bill and Aimee gave us our space, but they were very quick to respond whenever we had questions. <br/><br/>We would definitely recommend this space for anyone, especially if your travelling with a 4 legged friend!"
30442754,765034023,2021-05-31,94277368,Jan,"Aimee & Bill's petite hideaway was great. A little tight for our 5 week stay, but the fenced yard was like having another room. Great hospitality and friendliness. Thanks, guys!!"
30442754,418873908446982117,2021-07-31,392029573,Haylee,Bill and Aimee were wonderful hosts!
30442754,424606634475287468,2021-08-08,409984366,Hanoch,"Very well appointed cottage with a very nice yard.  Quiet and cozy, and excellent with a dog.     Very clean.  A bit tight, but for the most part worked out well for the two of us and Houdini (our 6 yr old coon-hound), on our two-day visit. <br/><br/>Hosts were incredibly responsive."
30442754,430421547600371768,2021-08-16,109711764,Laura,"Bill & Aimee were great hosts with a beautiful place! It was the perfect place to stay with my pup and in a great location.

30442754,453663824673682328,2021-09-17,68932949,Rebekah,Fantastic and private get-away in Salem. This place is centrally located and close to just about everything. It has it’s own private yard and Aimee and Bill have lots of local knowledge and are happy to share it. We really enjoyed our stay and warm Salem welcome.
30442754,459446659477363026,2021-09-25,190663621,Rita,"Bill and Aimee's cottage is exceptionally clean, well maintained, comfortable and cozy.  There is also a lovely tranquil  back yard in which to relax. Aimee was extremely helpful and welcoming and very willing to provide local information which might be useful.  We enjoyed our short stay and would recommend  this place to other guests.<br/>Rita and Chris"
30442754,465207159582108128,2021-10-03,87158313,Sara,"Cute little backyard cottage, very nice yard if you have a small dog (like us).  The unit is great for a couple, not really big enough for 3 people unless one wants to sleep on a couch.  It’s a good sofa bed but not enough room to use it as such unless you want to give up all the main room floor space.  Well stocked kitchen with a single burner"
30442754,469581946887643553,2021-10-09,413513700,Tamara,"The cottage was wonderfully appointed. Aimee and Bill were fabulous, recommended great things to do and places to eat. Bed was super comfy."

30442754,513872107998411899,2021-12-09,61835006,Scott,"This little hideaway is perfect for that couple looking for a quiet and romantic getaway. While the bungalow is in the hosts' backyard, there is a unexpected and welcome privacy. It sits behind the garage and offers a private yard that's perfect for enjoying pleasant spring and summer evenings. The place is equipped with everything you'll need for a cozy trip, and a bottle of wine likely will be waiting for you (it was for me). Bill and Aimee are outgoing and friendly, there if you need them and not when you prefer some privacy. The perfect balance."
30442754,519574145300559518,2021-12-17,35076382,Heather Jean,A lovely tiny home! The private fenced yard would be perfect for doggos.

30442754,615279703134386646,2022-04-28,153180873,Sarah,"I stayed here for 3 weeks and loved it. It’s private and cozy, and conveniently located close to food and stores. Safe neighborhood and great for walking. Bill & Aimee are kind, thoughtful and eager to help if you need anything. I really appreciated the fully fenced yard for my dogs, and the bungalow is fully equipped with everything you need. Highly recommend."
30442754,626922343337734010,2022-05-14,59796345,Brittany,"Great place to stay and close to many places downtown . The owners were friendly and accommodating , with clear communication"
30442754,637765512082680972,2022-05-29,89305187,Vista,i love how their place was fenced in. made it so easy for us to bring our pup! comfy bed too. we stayed there to be near some waterfalls we wanted to see. their place was 40 mins from silver falls state park. perfect lil tiny home and 5-9 mins to downtown where the good food and shops are.
30442754,641418464301408877,2022-06-03,22495262,Catherine,Bill and Aimee were great hosts. This is an adorable tiny house with a private yard and entry. The bed was comfortable and Bill and Aimee were super helpful and kind (even helped us figure out extending our stay when I goofed and booked us to leave a day early - oops). We really enjoyed our stay at this cute cottage!
30442754,647932915200418536,2022-06-12,46900394,Leah,Friendly hosts and a great little spot in Salem!
30442754,658724471533008940,2022-06-27,80824732,Mike,"Bill & Aimee, are amazing responsive hosts! They provide an attractive modern guest house. The property is quiet and private with amazing grounds. Our dogs were relaxed and felt at home in no time.  We will return for another stay without hesitation.<br/>Becky& Mike"
30442754,668926440658140922,2022-07-11,47267415,Che,"Cozy, well equipped space with your own fenced in yard. Hosts are communicative and accommodating. Wonderfully located, a perfect spot for the weekend while doing the Oregon 70.3 Ironman event. Highly recommend and we will be back."
30442754,675393823206348548,2022-07-20,136797746,Katy,"A little like staying in a construction zone, but comfortable."
30442754,697911938961719782,2022-08-20,401153706,Cayce,"The house is adorable and very conveniently located in a popular part of Salem. For our trip is was the perfect location putting us at the perfect distance to be close to so many restaurants, but also not right on the main strip to have to worry about road noise. Bill and Aimee were wonderful hosts, and checked in to make sure everything was going smoothly during the trip. The location also felt very secure with the fencing and passcode lock. Definitely would stay again!"
30442754,714532749244191589,2022-09-12,292257553,Ellen,"We enjoyed the cottage with it’s lovely courtyard. The inside is small, as they noted in their ad, but comfortable. We had everything we wanted and needed. We will feel comfortable staying there again."
30442754,719674930416932575,2022-09-19,144169578,Chez,"I required a place to reside while my house was being repaired after a water pipe leak. It felt like being in my own home and was only 2 miles away from my house, near to everything to which I’m accustomed. I’m grateful for their attention to detail, design, and cleanliness."
30442754,726204018395008795,2022-09-28,61533910,Jonathan,This is a great place with a private backyard. Great location! Bill and Aimee are awesome hosts.
30442754,734902103603429383,2022-10-10,179646562,Angelyn,"This is a wonderful little retreat.  Private and generally quiet.  Great for a dog! Pleasant outside space.  Bed is super soft - like sleeping on a marshmallow! It is close to the main commercial avenue and near a lovely old cemetery.  I would not say it is a comfortable walk to any parks or attractions but for the cemetery which permits walking dogs on leash.  It is close to many standard suburban businesses but not a quaint old downtown.  Driving to downtown, the capital and municipal buildings and parks is short and easy though.  I will definitely stay again if in Salem."
30442754,743515043633752333,2022-10-22,74640981,Robin,"This is a really lovely small home to stay in. Everything was clean and set up so well, the bed was super comfortable and the outside area is a great place to sit and relax. Hosts were great communicators. I would highly recommend this location."

30442754,832780025488275517,2023-02-22,108894571,Joyce,"Had a very nice stay while visiting my daughter who is attending Willamette University.  Cozy bungalow, perfect for two people and a dog!  Close to restaurants and local parks.  Nice little mini fridge with a freezer that works!  Private yard for my dog so she could stretch her legs and play.  Very easy to communicate with Bill and Aimee and quick to reply to any requests.  Would recommend for anyone visiting Salem."
30442754,840686843632414286,2023-03-05,76641054,Stephanie,Came up to Salem for a basketball tournament. What drew us to the listing was that it was pet friendly. It was very clean and accommodating and a great location for where we had to travel to.
30442754,845752777183688914,2023-03-12,232868573,Janus,"This is a wonderful location to come and just relax. The private yard with places to sit outside is inviting and sooo calm and quiet. The house is small, as mentioned in the description. It is set up efficiently though and everything is there for you without any clutter. Super clean. For a place to stay that is private, quiet, and welcoming this is a bargain. The hosts are remarkably friendly and focused on making sure you have everything you need to feel at home. Looking forward to staying there again."
31907842,421532190,2019-03-09,20158652,Theo,A beautiful place in a great part of Salem. Great hosts.
31907842,424002732,2019-03-15,121142303,Catherine,Great place! Nice hosts! Thank you so much for a great stay!

31907842,427010030,2019-03-22,14296016,Melanie,"This is an outstanding find! Christopher and Jackie's place was exactly what I needed after a really long day! My check in time changed throughout the day and they were very accommodating and responsive. Jackie met me in the driveway to get me settled into the space - even though it was well past 9pm. The unit is on the third floor of the house (so heed the warning about stairs) with a completely separate entrance.  <br/>The space is very clean and nicely appointed. Lots of pillows - which I love. They had very thoughtful touches; SOFT towels, a bag of good ground coffee, fans for both bedrooms, and a noise machine next to the queen bed to drown out any traffic noise. The bath was nice and deep - great for a relaxing tub. There is no TV (which was great for me) in the unit - instead they supplied a small bookshelf with a variety of books for any interest. <br/>I frequently have to stay in Salem for work and Jackie and Christopher's space will be the first place I try to book from now on."
31907842,428705835,2019-03-25,144517332,Akshay,Jackie and Christopher were amazing hosts! It was my first time to Oregon and this was the perfect host and house. They were very nice and the location was amazing! Conveniently placed and a few minutes from downtown. Definitely would love to stay here again.
31907842,429049116,2019-03-26,54682513,Haley,"Can I please just move in? This AirBnb is so lovely, comfortable and a great location. It was hard to get out of bed in the morning. I arrived much later than expected and Jackie stayed up to greet me and show me the space. It’s beautiful and I only wish I could’ve stayed longer. They had a white noise machine next to the bed too which I’ve always wanted to try. Thank you!"
31907842,429362835,2019-03-27,145736351,Taylor,"This place is in a perfect location for exploring Salem. (It would also be great if you have to do any work in downtown Salem.) It is a very charming victorian home that has been tastefully updated. The kitchen is a huge plus, especially if you are trying to save money on dining! We would love to stay here again."
31907842,430469694,2019-03-30,5423866,Gina,"This is a beautiful space with its own private entrance, and especially wonderful for families - I came with my 5 year old son and he loved having his own little room. It was also very nice for me to have a living room to relax in after he went to bed. Lovely decorating with thoughtful touches, sparkling clean, nice soft beds and linens, lots of useful kitchen tools, deep tub for soaking. It's a little drafty when it's chilly as it's an older home but the heater is very fast and powerful and you have control over it. It's such a charming apartment and I was really pleased with it. Also a great location convenient to downtown and kind and welcoming hosts. I had an emergency where my wallet was missing and Jackie called the last place I used it without my even asking. Lovely place to stay. I highly recommend it!"
31907842,431370391,2019-03-31,184811387,Kurt,"This spot is great! In a very easy to get to part of Salem. The stay was quiet and the apartment was cute. Great value, great stay."

The space is incredibly comfortable and relaxing -- has all the ""things' you may need (and a great book selection that you didn't know you needed!)"
31907842,433118341,2019-04-05,21343050,Nora,"Very cozy and cute space. My stay was very short, but if I ever need to stay in Salem again, this is the spot!"
31907842,433508544,2019-04-06,47928165,Kevin,"This was the perfect location near downtown Salem for what I was looking for. It was sparkling clean, comfortable, private and just as described. Jackie and Chris made themselves available as needed. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was spacious and the kitchen has everything needed to prepare a lite meal. The only hiccup to my stay was the breaker switched off while the microwave was running. Definitely a great stay."
31907842,438825102,2019-04-17,25620333,Phil,"This is a beautiful and charming upstairs flat in a great location. Jackie and Christopher are doing some landscaping projects outside at the moment that complicate the access a bit, but the space and location are well worth it."
31907842,439796493,2019-04-19,251149781,Calista,"This air bnb was great! The space was super cozy and all around very nice to stay in! The only downsides would be the super steep stairs leading to the space and the creaky floors as it’s hard not to be too loud. I’m aware these are unfixable so it’s really no issue, just a heads up."
31907842,441244547,2019-04-21,92727880,Brenda,Very friendly hosts!!! A very clean and unique space.We loved the old house charm!!!

31907842,442940508,2019-04-24,30856247,Natalie,"Perfect walking distance to the capital buildings and located in a really adorable neighborhood! The space is stylishly decorated but still comfy and welcoming. Jackie is an excellent hostess and very responsive: if I need to come to Salem again, this is where I will be staying!"
31907842,445648134,2019-04-29,137191775,Sibre,"Comfortable stay in a fantastic location. Lots of helpful little touches - like salt and pepper in the kitchen, travel-size toothpaste in the bathroom, and a residential parking guest pass - really made it a great experience."

31907842,447446551,2019-05-03,179263517,Debra,"Jackie and Christopher are the quintessence of warm, thoughtful hospitality.  We couldn't ask for better.  Besides their helpfulness and kindness, we experienced excellent accommodations--very clean, comfortable, fully equipped kitchen with excellent stove/oven and fridge, two nicely dedicated sleeping areas with very comfy beds, outstanding bathroom with a shower I want to beam over to our house!  The tone and tenor of the family was beautiful--truly a connected, loving family.  The northside location spurred me and my son to walk lots, including to the nearby downtown area, Riverfront, Willamette University campus, and State Capitol Building.  The truth is experiencing this family and their hospitality was in itself worth the very modest price of admission!"
31907842,448066754,2019-05-04,231463023,Sara,They were wonderful hosts! The location was perfect for where we needed to go the following day
31907842,448888986,2019-05-05,11111927,Jennifer,"Don't even hesitate to stay here. AMAAAZING accommodations with great views of the tree tops. Sun streams in come morning, comfy beds, and the shower is the bomb Jackie was a sweetheart and met our every need. I can;t wait to come back to this little oasis in Salem:)"

31907842,452747279,2019-05-13,216288540,Joni,"This was a home away from home experience! The suite is comfortable, extremely clean and full of charm. Christopher and Jackie are very friendly and accommodating, and communication is very quick. Having the kitchen was a huge plus for us, and we took full advantage of it. Small extras were appreciated  (room fans some toiletries, extra towels,  a few snacks and COFFEE! ) <br/><br/>As the host have mentioned in their listing, there are quite a few stairs up to the suite, so if you have mobility issues concerns keep that in mind. <br/><br/>We hope to come back and stay here again definitely recommend it!"

31907842,453381098,2019-05-15,21855281,Rhiannon,Amazing spot! Would absolutely stay again!

31907842,454605852,2019-05-18,22903802,Christian,Great place.
31907842,457735748,2019-05-24,89609098,Chandra,"Great location if you want to be downtown. Stairs can be tricky (I should have packed lighter!). Nicely equipped kitchen, bathroom was beautifully decorated and charming. Main bed is a double so might be too cozy for a couple but comfy for one person, could definitely have another person in the twin and a third on the fold-out couch if needed. Wonderfully thoughtful touches, lots of pillows, blankets, fans, towels and more."
31907842,459035960,2019-05-26,88672419,Megan,"The space was as described, very clean, and also cute. We didn’t hear any noise from the house below. It’s a lovely place and close to downtown, easy street parking. We would stay again!"
31907842,460644581,2019-05-29,83128054,Sam,A wonderfully charming place to stay with all the amenities you could ever need!

31907842,464444636,2019-06-05,225802916,Haley,This place was adorable and spotless. Great hospitality and they had everything I could’ve needed.
31907842,472013133,2019-06-18,15978243,Stormy And Conor,"These hosts really embody the spirit of AirBnb: attentive, locally based and engaged with the space and guest which is exactly where I want my lodging dollars to go. The space is immaculately clean and furnished in a really cozy and homespun way."
31907842,472980175,2019-06-20,79124492,Kathleen,Super cute studio. Very clean and comfortable. Everything you need is there. The WiFi isn’t the best but it does its job. The street is also a bit noisy but you are on the third floor so you have a bit of distance from the traffic sounds. Other than that Jackie was very accommodating and generous! I would highly recommend this place!
31907842,476220259,2019-06-25,50828280,Robert,Great place.

Hosts were wonderful to communicate with. <br/>One thing to be aware of are the amount of stairs. There are stairs on the deck and then a small, but steep & narrow flight to access the rooms. Those with any mobility issues should be wary."
31907842,479396898,2019-06-30,16543269,Kurtis,"This is a beautiful home and a really fun space to stay in. Jackie was responsive and helpful the whole stay and the house was wonderful. Craftsman style home, your own private entrance to the top floor and a real gem. I would definitely stay here again if I found myself back in Salem."
31907842,510213865,2019-08-15,21726962,Grace,"Such a lovely and comfortable place to live. You get your own kitchen and bathroom so you’re not sharing anything with anyone, which is super important to me. You also get a bunch of supplies of towels and blankets. I love the white noise machine beside one of the beds. The whole family is so welcoming and nice. Jackie is super responsive and accommodating, there’s really nothing negative about this place that I can think of. Would definitely come back!"

It felt like we were at the top of the world on the third floor, among all the treetops and looking down on the neighborhood roofs. This is a stylish space with lots of room and a full kitchen. We were able to eat in and relax. We appreciated how bright it was with all the windows and all small touches in the decor and kitchen fully stocked with all kinds of amenities. Wonderful and kind hosts! Fantastic hospitality!"

The last staircase is steep but short. The bathtub is one of the best I’ve been in- nice and deep with lots of hot water. There is road noise but really only in the morning. I didn’t use the white noise machine. It was a very enjoyable 3 nights. When I locked myself out, they promptly let me back in. Nice people!!"

31907842,615329643,2020-03-07,138239738,Kayla,If you're in to old house charm this place is for you! Noise from the street can be a bit much at times as the windows are original single pane. Furnishings fit the space and are cute. Bathroom is very spacious and the oversized bath tub is amazing. Parking is at a premium and is on the street.
31907842,617103292,2020-03-11,340214326,Josephine,A great spot.

31907842,621293847,2020-03-29,288659630,Lanelle,This apartment is perfect for a couple it is upstairs above the owners home. I did have teenage boys with me and they could hear them downstairs so I felt bad but location is downtown and convenient check in and parking is very easy.
31907842,622318590,2020-04-12,214271592,Nathan,"Great value. It's centrally located in Salem close to many stores, restaurants, etc. Parking is easy. Nice bathroom and comfortable beds."
31907842,622596285,2020-04-17,163587295,Suki,The house itself has some old world charm and some stairs (no biggie for this 45 year old nurse). Check-in was as described with pictures. I communicated about staying out first night via AirBNB. Parking on the side street with provided permit works well. The place is fairly private aside from seeing kids out back where the entrance is.  Some white noise from the busier street was suitable for me (had it everywhere I’ve lived over past 20 years).  <br/>In all fairness I didn’t sleep on the beds because I spent the night at a friend’s house. The following day I chose to drive home early after napping on the sofa.  I reported in person about leaving early to ensure lockup and inspection could be done . If circumstances were different between my friend and myself I’d stay again.
31907842,622747340,2020-04-19,191286136,Delainy,Such a cute and clean space and the beds are super comfortable!
31907842,622973581,2020-04-23,1512635,Patricia Jo,"It is a beautiful space with a huge bathtub, but also on an extremely busy street. Even with all the windows closed, I could hear traffic and I didn't get a restful night's sleep."
31907842,623195037,2020-04-26,145895754,Jillian,Cute apartment in great central location. Hosts were very helpful and communicated quickly.
31907842,624464182,2020-05-10,114256221,Karen,Jackie greeted us at check in.  She is a very friendly hostess.  The place was super clean and cute.  It was easy to find and just as described.  We would definitely stay here again next time we're in town!
31907842,625352430,2020-05-19,107931599,Melissa,"Absolutely perfect!! <br/>You are ""in"" their home, but 100% private and you never feel like your invading someone's space. The apartment is decorated so nice and everything is clean and just really amazing. <br/>I'm SO grateful we stayed here!!"
31907842,625444282,2020-05-20,145644533,Bethany,"Absolutely enjoyed my stay here. The unit is private, unique, and charming. I had everything that I need, will return back in the future"
31907842,625522015,2020-05-21,158605005,Kayln,"Thank you so much for letting me and my boyfriend stay in your amazing space. I loved all the quirky things about the space we stayed in, from original hardware to the windows! it was amazing thank you again. I will definitely be seeking this space out again in the future as I’ll be in Salem more often! This is definitely a great price for the space you get. The children that live at the house are very respectful as well as helpful! They told us where to go as they were playing outside their house!"
31907842,626701179,2020-05-29,40880859,Mariah,"Great home! Private entrance and comfortable space. Great for long stays. I Warm for the summer months, but there is a window box. Very close the the state capitol! Highly suggest."
31907842,627601297,2020-06-03,58851893,B. Dani,Great little space with a nice view of Salem. Close to downtown.
31907842,627715340,2020-06-04,112043828,Kristina,I am a local that needed a last minute booking so I could work on my final exams out of my noisy house. <br/>The place was clean and cozy! Communication was fast and friendly. I also learned about a whole new neighborhood that I hadn’t checked out before. It reminded me of the beautiful neighborhoods in Sellwood PDX and it was centrally located close to downtown.<br/>I will definitely keep this place in the back of my mind when I need a break and I’ll let friends from out of town know that this spot is ideal! <br/>The stairs are a little weird coming up but I also love the old quirks that come with old houses
31907842,628323487,2020-06-07,5425843,Daniel,"This was one of the best Airbnb's I've stayed at in the PNW. Great central Salem location, scrupulously clean, cute modern design. Large (did I mention clean?) Bathroom. <br/><br/>Will definitely stay again."
31907842,628687999,2020-06-09,300341947,Catherine,"This space is an adorable little 3rd story walk up, quaint and cute with everything you'll need for a long or short stay. There is a little road noise as mentioned in the description, but with the super comfortable bed, you won't notice at all. Wish I could have stayed longer!"
31907842,629318095,2020-06-13,151192256,Kristin,"We loved staying at Christopher and Jackie’s Airbnb. When we each arrived, each of said out loud that we would rent from them and live in the apartment if we could.<br/>Check in directions were simple and the beds were so comfy."
31907842,630266122,2020-06-17,108925695,Andy,"PROS:<br/><br/>- Great location, super easy check-in, always available street parking, no in-person contact with hosts.<br/>- The view from the top floor is nice. <br/>- Bathroom is a good size and shower pressure was perfect. <br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>- I wouldn’t say it was dirty, but it wasn’t the cleanest it could have been — and I think this is important especially during a pandemic. The kitchen drawers, cabinets, and silverware were not properly cleaned (crumbs, leftover food stains, etc.) and  there was left over food in the fridge from the people before us. <br/><br/>- If Jello was a bed, this is it. The beds were far too squishy for my partner and I. Yes, we tried both. We had four tiresome nights of tossing and turning. The mattresses sink in the middle, and both mattresses droop on the sides because the bed frames underneath are a smaller size. <br/><br/>- I cut my leg on a nail sticking out of the wicker basket in the living room within five minutes of arriving. <br/><br/>The condition of the space overall left me wondering how thoroughly it’s inspected after every use. Overall, I’d say it’s an okay spot for a quick stay, but I wouldn’t book again."
31907842,630419479,2020-06-18,158605005,Kayln,I love staying here when in Salem for work
31907842,630642618,2020-06-19,90654066,Kendra,"This was such a lovely spot to stay. I definitely would recommend it. It was easy to locate, beautiful views, and the best bathtub ever!"
31907842,630854442,2020-06-20,114256221,Karen,Everything was perfect for our quick over nighter.
31907842,644779094,2020-07-31,221079390,Dave,"Awesome pitstop in our roadtrip up from San Diego to Seattle. We were provided a parking pass free of charge to park our U-haul for the night in front of the listing. One worry was safety of the neighborhood because we had a U-haul, but we had no issues there. Really cool home layout and the 2 A/Cs were great."
31907842,645368059,2020-08-01,71583468,Veronica,Christopher and Jackie had such a lovely home- exactly as advertised. The home is located in a nice quiet neighborhood and amenities are within a few minutes drive. The apartment was super clean and well furnished. There were plenty of clean towels which we definitely appreciated.. We were only in town for the night but it was just what we needed. Thanks again for welcoming us into your home!
31907842,646018257,2020-08-02,173041335,Anel,"Bigger than expected, perfect to sleep three people and great distance from Portland. We really enjoyed our stay at Jackie’s place!"
31907842,648409116,2020-08-08,34858339,Marlene,This place has got to be the perfect example of staying at an attachment into someone's home. There are the flights of stairs but we were for warned. The street is quiet and never did we feel unsafe even when we arrived back late. The space is clean and soooo cute. The beds are a little soft but still very comfortable. We will for sure keep this place in mind when visiting family in town.
31907842,650580474,2020-08-13,12938255,Douglas,"In the heart of downtown, steps yes, but the space is perfectly setup"
31907842,654920009,2020-08-22,363566584,Shiloh,"Really cute place, loved to stay there! Really nice host."
31907842,655632891,2020-08-23,43944142,Leigha,"Very nice space, exactly as advertised. Perfect for 2-3 people. Great location, walking distance to parks and downtown activities (well, those that exist during quarantine...). Christopher and Jackie were quickly responsive to all of our questions. I would highly recommend."
31907842,656469165,2020-08-25,5346602,Diane,"This is a very nice little attic apartment, comfortable and clean."
31907842,657080943,2020-08-27,13644398,Ryan,Great space close to downtown. Quick responses and clean!
31907842,657533080,2020-08-28,21155519,Windy,Super cute space. Great value. Comfortable bed. Close to Willamette University. Larger space than I expected and a very roomy bathroom. Quiet neighborhood. Would stay here again.
31907842,659469378,2020-09-01,316746847,JamesChristian,"We wanted an affordable, yet comfortable place to stay during our short visit to Salem.  Jackie and Christopher's place exactly fit the bill and exceeded our expectations.  The apartment was a little bigger than expected.  The A/C was good at keeping it cool during our 90 degree visit.  Parking was easy to find on Belmont each time.  The place was very clean and well decorated with plentiful storage spaces and a rather large kitchen and bathroom.  The tub is huge and deep.  The water pressure is excellent.  The fridge a good size.  Jackie was always quick to answer our communications before and during our stay as well.  The Wi-Fi was strong enough for what we needed.  We loved the white-noise machine in the main bedroom and the fan was great too.  <br/><br/>If I was asked what could be improved, I would say that having better room-darkening curtains in the bedroom would have made our stay more comfortable.  The morning sun in the summer is powerful and we are used to darker curtains at home and at most hotels we visit.  However, some people might be fine with their darkening ability.  <br/><br/>The whole place is super cute and we will probably stay there the next time we are in Salem."
31907842,660329646,2020-09-04,164841737,Annie,"Wonderful space, great location, friendly family!"
31907842,660683235,2020-09-05,13935606,David Y Natalia,"Great location, super comfortable unit."
31907842,661299771,2020-09-06,294179351,Joshua,"my favorite three pros:<br/><br/>1. the mattresses were comfortable and the sheets/pillowcases smelled clean. i've been to a lot of airbnb and i swear most airbnb places have the worst mattresses. the larger bed was very nice.<br/>2. the place was very clean. even checked behind the toilet seat and it was clean.<br/>3. responsive hosts to my messages as late as 11 :30 pm and as early as 9 am.<br/>4. has working ac/heater<br/><br/>overall, my partner and i just needed a place to sleep overnight for our road trip up north so the three pros i wrote above were basically the most important aspects i desired. i didn't really have any cons for my trip personally, but i can imagine the below may be potential cons for others. pretty minor stuff.<br/><br/>potential cons:<br/><br/>1. there's no tv. i didn't care for it, but maybe others do.<br/>2. it's like a studio, so no walls between the beds.<br/><br/>5/5 rate from me, thanks."
31907842,662212710,2020-09-08,215783017,Mickey,"Excellent customer service very clean, kind of a steep staircase to get up to the residence but it was well worth it. Nice comfortable beds great amenities 2 air conditioning units perfect"
31907842,662414511,2020-09-09,91759234,Arlo,This place is very clean and well kept.  We would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Salem.

31907842,663032112,2020-09-11,9191362,Walt & Christy,"Christopher & Jackie's Suite is adorable. The vintage architecture of this place is intact and has such charming character. Sparkling clean and a great value too. We loved the cozy feel of this place, the bedroom alcoves were the best.  We would definitely try for another stay here when we're in Salem.  Good communication and easy location, we recommend this stay to you."
31907842,664944357,2020-09-16,367524151,Michele,"Cozy, clean & comfortable accommodations.  Just what we needed after a long day of travel."
31907842,665158090,2020-09-17,285550696,Jennifer,"There was terrible wildfire smoke in Salem when I stayed.  Christopher and Jackie had sealed off the windows with towels and had a very nice air conditioning unit running when I arrived.  It was so nice to come in to nice, cool air when I arrived.  I didn’t cook, but the kitchen table was a nice spot for me to enjoy my take out meal.  The suite is on the top floor and is very cute.  There is a lot of charm.  There are original windows, which are beautiful, but do let in a bit of noise from the busy street in front.  The air conditioning was running, so there was white noise, but the traffic sounds didn’t disturb me while I was sleeping.  The bigger bed was just fine and I had no issue with being comfortable.  There were also darkening curtains or rollers in the windows to help block light if needed.  Chris and Jackie were very gracious in answering many questions I had.  Their check in was also very clear and easy."
31907842,665484217,2020-09-18,141425544,William,This is a great place to stay. It has style and charm. We were very comfortable and everything is super easy as a guest here. We would definitely like to stay here again when in Salem.

31907842,668187287,2020-09-26,149462767,Alyssa,"A comfortable, clean, and cozy space. It was easy to find on-street parking (and there’s a residential pass that goes with the suite). The wi-fi was strong enough for me to be able to work while the kids did online school too! Would highly recommend!"

31907842,702586999,2020-10-21,149750493,David,"Nice location. We liked having a private entrance and although it is part of a big home, it felt separated from the rest of the house. They also provided great local tips which made our exploring a lot easier. Highly recommend"

31907842,713164221,2020-12-03,134122155,Alaina,"Cute little apartment on top level of their home. Kids running around the yard, a little bit of a surprise, but it was cute to see kids outside playing tag instead of plugged into a device. <br/>Amazing detail touches that make you feel right at home."
31907842,713497128,2020-12-05,23316519,Christine,"Lovely stay! Super clean and the step by step, contactless check-in was such a plus during Covid times."
31907842,714966620,2020-12-12,379107438,Christopher,"I enjoy the minimalist touch this property brings. First glance the home was well kept and I could feel the family home environment that I needed for my wife and I and our two kids. The space was well staged, upkept and with modern touches all around. <br/>My favoite thing about staying here on this property, was a feel of a escape from the world and able to unwind in the quite upstairs.<br/>I felt welcomed onto the property. And i never once felt like a stranger. The house is in a nice neighborhood. there was a good working heater, stove top and refrigerator that my family prepared meals with, plenty of towels and blankets for us to use. I really enjoyed that there was not a television because i like the quiet get away staying here gave us. I would recommend staying here. And i also would consider staying here again in the furture. <br/>-thank you Christopher and Jackie for the opportunity. <br/>This was my first AirBNB and you have opened my eyes to opportunities that i will never be staying in a hotel out of town ever again."
31907842,715335086,2020-12-13,65058004,McKenzie,Always a great stay!

31907842,386964412507280079,2021-06-17,374922062,Greg,"Christopher and Jackie’s place was as advertised. It was clean and well set up. I really appreciated the small, but well stocked kitchen so I didn’t have to eat out ever day. The location was really great for access to downtown and the Capitol area.  The hosts were also understanding and accommodating with my schedule. Would stay again."
31907842,387653881828775992,2021-06-18,240727951,Ty,"What a lovely place to stay. I usually hesitate to stay places that are shared but there were no disturbances here - didn’t even hear anybody else. Being on the top level of the house with a separate entrance worked out great. Also, the entire family was welcoming. The kids even invited my own kid to play - sweet bonus!"
31907842,389112229494246031,2021-06-20,169209227,Ellen,"If you have a student at Willamette this is the perfect place to stay during a visit. The location is close to campus and in a sweet neighborhood. The suite itself is full of charm and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. There are two alcoves that make up the bedrooms with thick curtains that provide privacy. The bathroom is huge and the kitchen is adorable with a fridge, stove, coffee maker, etc. - all that you would need or expect. There is A/C and black-out curtains which kept the space cool. It was the perfect place to spend the evening after a day out with our recent graduate. Check-in was a breeze with Jackie giving clear instructions on where to park and how to find the separate suite entrance. We had the good fortune of meeting the host and she is delightful. We wish we found this place sooner and will definitely stay here again if we come back to Salem."
31907842,390572512550928011,2021-06-22,191308754,Mollee,Great stay. Seriously consider coming here

Comfortable, soft beds. It's a beautifully rehabed old house so many original touches. Stairs are steep so pack light."

31907842,426096803599804188,2021-08-10,1839169,G Gilbert,"The listing does a good job, in photos and words, this apartment. Pay attention to the stairs and the fact that the apartment is in the third floor. I found the apartment to be very comfortable and quiet. I used the bed in the main bedroom and I think it was very comfortable. I’m not a fan of futons as couches so I didn’t use it. But the upholstered chair was nice. Tall people (like me) be aware that there are coved ceilings which slope down and can cause you to bang your head if you’re not careful."
31907842,427552587186151484,2021-08-12,135720546,Cindy,"This place is a lovely little apartment, so clean and nice overlooking tree tops. As others have noted, lots of stairs to haul luggage up. But Jackie and family so nice and accommodating. They were a joy!  The apartment a bit warm on hot nights, but the air conditioners keep it cool during the day. Seek out the fans if conditioners too loud at night. Busy street out front, but nice safe feeling neighborhood. A very good value and feeling of privacy."

31907842,486279733201832545,2021-11-01,81927666,Coral,The location was absolutely perfect!! The house is so beautiful and the air bnb is even cuter in person and more spacious than expected. Would 10/10 stay here again!
31907842,489910250570205767,2021-11-06,91491367,Amanda,"It's a great place for one to three people!  I loved the historical sense to the place, and the sleeping areas as well as the main area are lovely.  The bathroom and kitchen are great with plenty of function and use.  The noise outside isn't bad at all, even though it is on a busy street.  You are within walking distance to many places, and it is a nice little neighborhood.  I would definitely stay there again. Very comfortable, and the hosts were kind when I forgot a piece of clothing behind."
31907842,491307686879062182,2021-11-08,368980454,Amy,These hosts were so accommodating & kind! The space was exactly what we were looking for. The charm of the guesthouse & the proximity to downtown Salem couldn’t be beat! Would definitely recommend!
31907842,492059875006329513,2021-11-09,103132423,Coutrney,Amazing views and cutest little attic apartment!
31907842,496419635561510995,2021-11-15,188598532,John,"We had a wonderful, relaxing weekend at Christopher & Jackie’s place.  Check-in was a breeze, and the stairs really aren’t that bad unless you have mobility issues.  The stairways are well lit, and we had no problems.  The place was spotless!  We didn’t use the kitchen facilities much, but we could see it was adequately equipped.  The bed was comfortable, and we slept very well.  Lots of extra towels were available too!  We would not hesitate to stay here again.  Many thanks!"
31907842,497132397237997407,2021-11-16,7982569,Jenifer,"This is a charming, well-appointed attic apartment. I enjoyed being within walking distance of downtown. Bring earplugs if you're sensitive to noise, as you can hear any car traffic on the streets below."
31907842,500848551387602625,2021-11-21,54730047,Garth,This is a great place with an excellent value price point. Very charming retreat and an easy 1 mile walk to downtown.

31907842,534127372536711041,2022-01-06,401262362,Rubi,One of the best value stays in Salem! This was a cozy Airbnb and we loved the location.
31907842,536302836741232929,2022-01-09,319975076,Jess,super cute and clean!
31907842,541331644895769612,2022-01-16,6835620,Aaron & Christine,"Christopher and Jackie were incredibly accommodating to our schedule and that made ALL the difference. The place itself is small but well-designed. It was quiet, easy to heat, and very clean. The room with the Queen bed has a nice pull-down shade plus a curtain so it stayed dark enough for me to sleep in. The other room does not get quite as dark. Street parking was decent. Wifi is decent in the living room, but not as strong in the main bedroom - we streamed music and shows just fine in the living room. Overall it's a great spot for its value comparatively."
31907842,544979489907331640,2022-01-21,61412119,Breanna,"This space was exactly what I needed while in Salem on a business trip. The location was great, and parking was easy with the pass that was provided. I felt very safe, which is always a consideration when I'm traveling solo. The apartment had everything that I could have wanted, and the bed was very comfortable. The kitchen was even well stocked! I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Salem."
31907842,546412493255803222,2022-01-23,17175211,Lexi,This is a charming Airbnb in the heart of Salem. Very convenient to downtown and the state Capitol buildings. The Airbnb itself was clean and well equipped — I loved the thoughtful extra snacks! I’ll definitely be back!
31907842,554459392535430691,2022-02-03,442053364,Spence,"Nice space in a nice neighborhood. Owners responded within short periods of time. The stairway up to the area is narrow and steep, but well worth it."
31907842,555848846535737760,2022-02-05,84397884,Tenzin,"Very cute studio with comfortable beds, there’s even an inflatable mattress if you need. Very kind hosts, had little snacks and oatmeal available and a kettle for hot water. The stairs are no joke, if you can’t do slightly steep stairs, this place may not work for you."
31907842,558785452635859532,2022-02-09,10004888,David,Super cute. Super clean. Great location. Spacious. Private. Highly recommended.
31907842,564586723238878518,2022-02-17,122942195,Catherine,"This is a really sweet, cozy and cute spot that feels a lot more spacious than the photos portray! There’s a closet for luggage/clothes in both rooms, toys for small kiddos (we brought our 3-year old and she loved the puzzles and younger toys), and a really nice suburban view with natural lighting from all the windows (all around except from the south). It is a tad bit noisy at night from the window in the queen bed bedroom but not a dealbreaker!<br/><br/>Before coming I read a few older reviews about the wifi and just want to note it hasn’t been changed yet~ It was pretty difficult watching shows let alone just checking email 😅"
31907842,565293252909066507,2022-02-18,23159321,Megan,"Charming apartment, very clean and great communication."

They made a special exception for our family that was very appreciated. The space itself was everything you need, clean and cosy. No Wifi issues, lots of little extras (oatmeal for breakfast, other snacks, makeup wipes). One of the best places we’ve stayed! Thank you 😊"
31907842,590580939644095524,2022-03-25,2790597,Emily,"This stay is delightful. Very well described in the listing. The bed and the shower are especially nice - comfortable and clean. The 3rd floor looks down over the whole neighborhood, which would be even more stunning when the trees have leafed out. Jackie was friendly and responsive."

31907842,600072821272709447,2022-04-07,1820678,Shannon,"My favorite Airbnb ! <br/><br/>Christopher and Jackie and their young family hosted me for three days in Salem<br/><br/>I appreciate all the attention to detail that made my check in and departure really easy. <br/><br/><br/>The space was clean and inviting. I slept well on the bed and appreciate the big, clean bathroom"
31907842,600836099184584003,2022-04-08,49036256,Sarah,"Christopher and Jackie are attentive hosts who seem to have thought of everything!  Their home provided all the necessities and way beyond.  Comfy beds, soft towels, a nicely sized kitchen and living area with room for privacy with two beds are only some of the features of their place.  It was a very nice stay!"
31907842,601526153614254288,2022-04-09,275870174,Dana,"Super convenient,   So comfortable and cute.   Coffee bar with supplied kuerigs was most appreciated after a week of traveling.   Great night sleep."

31907842,609424813541625431,2022-04-20,73640885,Debbie,Great place to stay.  The 2 bedrooms are very convenient and the kitchen had a few staples to help with any cooking you want to do.  Inside flight of stairs is quite steep but it is worth the climb if you are able.
31907842,610873585370337172,2022-04-22,76661950,Suzanne,"Great stay while visiting family in the area. The hosts were welcoming and accommodating. Their home was very clean and charming, we enjoyed the beautiful landscaping and watching their bunnies over a morning coffee."

31907842,617436555107930967,2022-05-01,43863610,Brooke,"Cute little place in Salem, perfect for one night on our road trip. Super clean with everything you need. Bedrooms are separated by curtains because it’s an attic, so make note of that if privacy is a concern."
31907842,618924310438485031,2022-05-03,1867188,Trinity,"This apartment is located on the top floor of a charming historic house. Parking was plentiful, the neighborhood felt safe and while located on a busy street, a fan or noise machine wipes the sound away. Nice big bathroom, very clean and black out curtains. Great location if you work or are visiting the capital and near green spaces for walking or exercising. Would highly recommend."
31907842,619673603964334978,2022-05-04,8674112,Sachin,Nice place!
31907842,623273061729375484,2022-05-09,188794729,Deanne,"Yes, stairs, but if that’s not a problem then this is a great, clean, cozy place. We appreciated the comfy bed and spacious bathroom. Parking was easy despite it being street parking. This is an older large home with a beautiful yard in a quiet neighborhood.  The host family resides here so communication couldn’t be easier. We come to Salem semi regularly to visit family and this was a perfect landing spot for us."
31907842,624743938258077874,2022-05-11,65395989,Mark,Cozy 3rd floor apartment.  It's a short walk to the Capitol and Willammette University where non-west coaster's may be impressed by a grouping of giant Sequoias.
31907842,627581900643479324,2022-05-15,126318635,Gowtham,Great place to stay.. pleasant locality..one of the best host(Jackie & Christopher) I have come across.
31907842,629006073934075901,2022-05-17,26713061,Zoe,"Such a great place! A whole cute little apartment upstairs, felt private and safe and luxurious. I walked downtown, took maybe 20 minutes or so, it was a beautiful day so that was great. Would have loved to spend more time there. Only suggestion i can think of is maybe having a couple more tea options would be nice. :) Thanks so much!"

31907842,641360765860501371,2022-06-03,100309636,John,"Very nice accommodations! Easy and accurate communications. Be forewarned, the upper story apartment requires a serious stair climb - but worth it!  We would definitely consider a return visit!"
31907842,642139365967688495,2022-06-04,295454631,Ryan,"Charming place in a great location in Salem.  We enjoyed having the kitchen to store and reheat our leftovers we’d collected on our road trip. Warm weather hasn’t been around yet this summer, but the upstairs apartment was already quite warm. However, there were fans and lots of windows to open to help cool down."
31907842,644324863884559951,2022-06-07,5937539,Christine,"Very cute place. Big shower and tub, full kitchen with coffee. Great for a stop over. No TV. Surrounding area is impacted by homeless and there’s no secure area for vehicle so if you’re traveling alone or with valuables in car be aware of that. Host is responsive and accommodating."
31907842,655191747074801507,2022-06-22,553821,Catherine,"What a lovely space! This is the perfect apartment for a small family or two people. I was traveling with my 17 year old son, so having a separate semi-private space for him was perfect. The living space is comfy, and the bathroom is bright cheery and spacious. Everything about the place was thoughtful, and tidy. There were really clear directions on how to get in and our expectation about the stairs was set. I love airbnb's like this there were it's personal and connected to real people, but you still have privacy. Jackie was super friendly and responsive!"
31907842,656565463042306876,2022-06-24,117955172,Diana,"This home is super cute and confortable. I slept in the small bed, which are often the kids bed so not as comfortable but this one was great.  We were extra tired so my husband had the main bed and said it was fine. <br/>They have a full size coffee make besides the coffee pods so if you need to fill your travel thermos it is easier.<br/>I would come again if in the area."
31907842,657368201127811832,2022-06-25,164359254,Delores,"We wanted to stay close to the waterfront and downtown area, and this location was just perfect.  The decor is really lovely and comfy.  We would definitely stay here again."

It has everything you need . . . a great location, a stocked kitchen, comfortable beds, closets with lots of hangers, beautiful decor, and it is the on the top floor of a vintage craftsman-style home. It was really hot the three days we were there, and there were three air conditioners. A beautiful garden was outside."
31907842,660942364183333202,2022-06-30,3628155,Annabella,Great spot for a stop off. Clean and comfortable with a well stocked kitchen and great coffee and a good shower. Easy to park and 20 minutes walk to town in quiet neighbourhood. Top floor was very hot despite all the AC. Turned the noisy one off but then difficult to sleep. Was a very hot few days so am sure fine rest of year.
31907842,684907700907816876,2022-08-02,472624156,Roi,"The place is really beautifull and clean, with very kind hosts.<br/>High recommended"

We just sat on the couch for a while and took in the city. Well stocked with everything you need and very private and cozy. Would absolutely love to come back. <br/>We also braved the cold and walked to some restaurants, bars, and shops. Quick walk and totally worth it!"

31907842,832781259284194053,2023-02-22,23819086,Michael,"Thank you for a great stay in Salem, Jackie! The space was very comfortable and relaxing. Close to downtown but with a tucked-away feel. Check-in was simple and parking was ample. I hope to stay here again and would highly recommend Jackie's place! Thanks!"
31907842,834161278414080919,2023-02-24,359029802,Jim,This is a cute upstairs of an old house. If you don’t like older homes this is not for you. Be aware there are lots of stairs. The upstairs is bright and the neighborhood is good. Very quiet.
31907842,842921627092461100,2023-03-08,36966165,Daniel,"We really enjoyed our 9-day stay at Jackie's place. Clean, plenty of towels and blankets, and a great location. 15-20 minute walk to downtown. Jackie went out of her way to address additional requests we had. Would stay there again."

We were in town to look at Willamette University and this was close and convenient. I would rent here again. Super easy to find and I appreciated the pictures detailing which door and stairs to take."
31907842,853051850978593371,2023-03-22,21330434,Michelle,"Walkable, cute and cozy lodgings, friendly host, cute and friendly outdoor cat named Nemo. This spot was wonderful for my short business stay in Salem!"
31907842,855133917540566095,2023-03-25,61704523,Debbie,"Jackie's place was perfect for us, and she went above and beyond to accommodate our special needs. we will definitely return and highly recommend to others!"
32018098,452257166,2019-05-12,220111575,Jerry,It was an absolute pleasure staying in this beautiful home! The owners communicated exactly what we needed to know. I would absolutely stay here again!!!
32018098,461046319,2019-05-30,243304821,Rachelle,"Patricia is an excellent host that goes above and beyond.  We enquired about staying at her home for attending a family wedding at a nearby vineyard.   Not only was the home location perfect, but she provided us with so many wonderful suggestions such as driving along the coast, hiking Silver Falls state park, and local wineries we extended our stay to allow time to explore Oregon.  Her home is warm, clean, beds are comfortable and linens are soft.  She provided all the kitchen amenities needed to enjoy an evening at home relaxing on her patio and hot tub.  After busy days exploring my boys enjoyed watching a movie in their tv work out room while we relaxed in the hot tub.  I highly recommend staying at their home and hope we can visit again.  My husband and I travel often for work and we are accustomed to Hilton, Omni and Starwood properties I would rate their home a 4 star hotel, but with her excellent feedback and costumer service I rate them at 5!"
32018098,466857124,2019-06-09,81111239,Chanel,"My family and I enjoyed our stay. The backyard is lovely, especially on a nice evening. Everything was comfortable and clean. The hosts’ communication was quick, and informational. The house is pretty segmented so it was hard for my family of 7 to all “hang” out in one room. Overall great accommodations!"
32018098,475180864,2019-06-23,72356528,Traci,Wonderful place to stay enjoyed the house and the gardens with the veggies and herbs
32018098,501561328,2019-08-03,25065087,Jenna,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this lovely home. We had a group of six (three couples), and we had plenty of space. We really enjoyed spending time in the backyard. The hot tub and fire pit were a perfect way to relax in the evenings. Joe was always very prompt with his responses. We would definitely stay at this home again!"
32018098,503912906,2019-08-06,171540485,Mandy,My family and I flew in from all over for a wedding here and we truly enjoyed our stay. Everything is what you would expect from the photos and more! The house is so spacious and clean. We absolutely loved the back yard and fresh veggies from the garden! We appreciated all the amenities and little details. It was warm and welcoming and we enjoyed every part of the house during our stay.
32018098,507682085,2019-08-11,83197075,Taylor,Great place! We loved the back yard area and the beds were very comfy!
32018098,521226468,2019-08-31,280967849,Matt,"Beautiful hope, with a beautiful view and garden!  I would highly recommend this location and would love to stay there again if I am ever back in the area!"

32018098,538444078,2019-09-29,32007670,Allison,"The home is beautiful and as advertised. The kitchen was fully equipped and the bonus garden out back added nicely to our dinner. The home is extremely clean and very tastefully appointed. Do are very comfortable and loved the extra touches throughout the home. The backyard is a beautiful area to hang out filled with flowers, vegetables and several sitting areas. Would highly recommend this home."
32018098,546650063,2019-10-13,25244207,Joseph,So glad we chose this place.  It’s equidistant from Corvallis and Eugene so it was perfect for our trip.  The place is very clean and comfortable.  Patricia and joe are super responsive.  Accessing the house is really easy.  And the hot tub...👌<br/><br/>The beds are really comfortable and the shower in the master is really nice. <br/><br/>My only criticism is the price and tv area. It’s a little expensive and there wasn’t a great spot to watch football.  But the other amenities made it worth every penny.
32018098,557732232,2019-11-01,144617507,Chris,"Beautiful home, equipped with all of the amenities you need to enjoy your time in wine country!  Joe and Patricia were great hosts!"
32018098,561190827,2019-11-08,215068640,Lauren,Great place to stay in Salem and plenty of room for 4! Great backyard as well to enjoy the crisp fall weather.

32018098,582311129,2019-12-26,10772124,David,"This place is beautiful. What a great house for a family to rent in Salem. This is the best part of Salem and accommodation in the area is limited. We felt lucky to have such a great place to stay for the holidays. Well equipped kitchen, nice bathrooms, and the media room is really fun. Highly recommend."
32018098,587893991,2020-01-03,284097731,Dave,"Beautiful home, comfortable beds, excellent hosts that responded immediately to us. We would definitely stay there again! Thanks for a wonderful stay, Joe and Patricia!!"
32018098,610079597,2020-02-23,85533215,Vivian,A beautiful home in a nice neighborhood with a pretty view of the water and open fields. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen is well stocked. We enjoyed our stay!
32018098,612060425,2020-02-28,96968009,Randall,"Absolutely beautiful home and perfect host. Do not pass the chance up to stay here, it will surprise you how nice this place and experience is!!!"
32018098,625252885,2020-05-18,33822372,Tracy,"If you need a place to stay in Salem, look no further than this lovely home!  The house was large and super clean.  The beds were very comfortable and the master bath was one of the best I have ever seen.  Every time we needed something while cooking for our large family, we found exactly what we needed in the large and extremely well stocked kitchen.  Lots of plates, cups, glasses, serving utensils, cookware, etc.  We enjoyed playing cards and games around the large dining table and the backyard was quite lovely, although due to rain we sadly didn't get to enjoy it as much as we would have liked.  But it would be a perfect spot to sit outside and enjoy the sunny weather, lots of seating and tables.  Again, if you need a house to host your family, pick this one, we were VERY happy with it!"
32018098,626259041,2020-05-25,137163813,Raven,This house is so beautiful & cozy! & the host is so sweet! The backyard is nice & big & so is the kitchen. The family & I enjoyed & would definitely recommend!
32018098,629300656,2020-06-13,169459865,Maryanne,"A real oasis and a lovely home for respite in Salem.  Close to wineries, parks, and other activities, too.  In spite of being nestled in the muddle of suburbia, the home has the feel of being tucked away and the decor has the charm of a Tuscan villa.  It’s spacious and we found everything as described.  The owners are very quick to respond to any questions and friendly.  Would absolutely stay here again.  I think it would be perfect for a women’s wine weekend or even a family reunion."
32018098,634082611,2020-07-02,341301039,Bradley,A great house and a great host!  The house is very nice and in a good/safe location.

32018098,640273382,2020-07-19,123755310,Christy,Patricia’s place is beautiful and the back yard is amazing! Pictures don’t do it justice. It was the perfect location and home base for visiting with extended family in the area.  They even had a chilled bottle of wine ready and waiting for us upon arrival. I highly recommend staying here.
32018098,647404910,2020-08-06,57270453,Bessie,This place was one of the best Airbnb we have stayed at. It’s super clean. All the amenities were great. The wine Patricia and Joe graciously offered us was one of the best. We all had a great relaxing time. The house was nicely decorated and very cozy. Very thankful to be enjoying this place during COVID-19. Thanks!!!
32018098,649161694,2020-08-09,275889804,Grant,Beautiful home with nice backyard and hot tub. The location was perfect for us. Host responded immediately to a question. I would highly recommend this rental.
32018098,650605887,2020-08-13,8772706,Elizabeth,"Perfect place for a quiet retreat. Evenings relaxing in the amazing outdoor space and hot tub was total bliss. Location is also fantastic, close to stores, very easy to get to. <br/>From booking through to the end of our trip, Patricia and Joe were the perfect hosts and we really appreciated all the little touches to make us feel totally welcome! Highly recommend and can’t wait to come back!"
32018098,651633338,2020-08-15,252045246,Lindsey,Such a beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood.  We had a great time.

32018098,656745629,2020-08-26,50555237,Jami,"Patricia and Joe's house is wonderful.  Clean, cared for, beautiful backyard, comfortable beds, great layout and more. Loved it!"
32018098,659443729,2020-09-01,61568502,RaeAnne,"Beautiful, comfortable home.  Perfect for our girl's weekend of hiking, card playing and wine.  The only downside is the stereo is outdated and is only equipped with classical music and jazz.  I suggest bringing your ownwireless speaker."
32018098,663042994,2020-09-11,50555237,Jami,Absolutely stay here.  Home and hosts are wonderful!
32018098,666908901,2020-09-21,54771807,Erika,"We were in town for a family wedding, and this was a great place to stay and all spend time together.  The backyard is beautiful and the perfect space to enjoy each other's company."
32018098,669949941,2020-10-01,8911614,Carisa,This house has everything you need! Fully stocked kitchen! They are very quick to respond to anything you need. The back yard is amazing and has fresh growing veggies to fill your salad with! A hot tub to warm you up! If I had one complaint it would be that the beds are all very firm. I am used to a soft sleep number bed so maybe I am spoiled! Other then that the house was 10 out of 10!
32018098,673648323,2020-10-11,227174175,Lora,Not what I was hoping for.
32018098,701242152,2020-10-17,62349263,Megan,Our stay at Patricia's place was great!<br/>The bedrooms were all spacious and comfortable and the backyard was beautiful - a great place for families to hang out! <br/>The host was very accommodating and responsive. I would definitely recommend staying here - especially in Fall (the country roads and miles of vineyards are gorgeous)!
32018098,704002284,2020-10-25,28415264,Carey,A great place to be with family! Super clean and the hot tub and work out room/media room are a perfect hang out.
32018098,709466310,2020-11-16,20265254,Joseph Alexander,"The house was beautiful and in a quiet, secluded neighborhood.   It was clean, well-stocked, and had everything we needed.  The hosts were very quick to respond and super helpful as well.  We will definitely be back next time we do another Willamette Valley weekend!"
32018098,711975880,2020-11-28,26368416,Anisha,"Great house, nice amenities. Perfect for a group getaway. We did not want for anything. Overall great stay"
32018098,716520003,2020-12-19,11987626,Russell,"Beautiful home in a peaceful neighborhood, very clean, with a gorgeous backyard! We will definitely stay here again!"
32018098,737391365,2021-03-07,25100263,Angelica & Surj,"Just what we needed. We didn't want to stay in a hotel, and the house was perfect: a good kitchen with everything needed to cook real meals, plenty of space, two fireplaces. The master bedroom includes a comfortably firm king size bed and a large bathroom with a wonderfully spacious shower.<br/><br/>The location is kind of amazing: close to a good grocery store and other necessities, but the surrounding greenery, especially off the back of the house, gives it a tranquil, almost remote feel. Very peaceful.<br/><br/>We'd love to stay here again someday to take advantage of the tranquil backyard and barbecue. This time, it rained pretty much the whole time we were there, but that was ok—the house has plenty of good specs for relaxing."
32018098,739241349,2021-03-14,144999059,Cameron,Beautiful and peaceful home. I spent most of the weekend in the hot tub!
32018098,743330589,2021-03-28,188910431,Aj,Amazing place - beautiful touches and great location. Hot Tub is great!!
32018098,746248047,2021-04-05,28586904,Vicki,"This is a great place for many reasons. First, the hosts were responsive and have clearly taken care to provide guests with pretty much everything you need. The living spaces and bedrooms were comfortable. The kitchen was very well-stocked with utensils, dishes, cooking pots and pans, and herbs/spices.<br/>And, the backyard is great!  The house backs up to open space so the view is lovely. Plus, the fire pit and hot tub made it even better. <br/>The only downsides were some traffic noise at night (we are light sleepers) and the stairs to the bedrooms were steep and shallow, which was difficult for my elderly mother. That said, we would definitely stay here again!!"
32018098,747501188,2021-04-10,52700225,Rick,"This house has so much character and charm that it instantly feels like a home. The interior is so beautiful and comfortable. We especially loved the game/theater room upstairs where we spent a lot of family time with the kids. The backyard is very welcoming and sparingly spaced with a lovely view!<br/>On top of that, the owners were so thoughtful and friendly which made the experience that much more memorable. Thank you for sharing your home with us. We look forward to returning on our next visit to OR."
32018098,748743330,2021-04-14,22308733,Taryn,"Patricia's home was perfect for our 5 day trip. You're only ~15 minutes from downtown Salem, which is wonderful as the weather turns warm and there's more commuter traffic. The house itself is comfortable, clean, and makes great use of it's many spaces and unique layout. We especially loved having the multiple sitting rooms, so some of my party could stay up later and talk while others went to sleep. The backyard is incredible - we LOVED the hot tub, the seating area, and the cool breezes off the gully. I will say personally this is definitely a better spot for several adults, rather than children, as the house is nicely put together and contains a lot of stairs - but it would be acceptable for older children as well. Kitchen was stocked as much as needed for how much one typically cooks on a long vacation, without being overwhelming. Overall, this was a great value and I would definitely recommend."
32018098,750044900,2021-04-18,388333057,Candace,Amazing house and location. Great communication from the host and thoughtful amenities provided.
32018098,753429750,2021-04-30,341301039,Bradley,We have stayed here multiple times now.  This is a great house with wonderful owners.  Easy to talk to and very responsive.  The house is always clean and comfy!
32018098,759281614,2021-05-16,4991796,Megan,This place was wonderful to stay at. It was incredibly spacious and really peaceful. We were surprised by how much privacy there was in a neighborhood with quite a few homes close by.<br/><br/>The master bedroom was incredible with an absolutely beautiful shower. All bedrooms were really clean and spacious.<br/><br/>We would absolutely recommend this place to stay.
32018098,765199678,2021-05-31,83132376,Sherri,"Without hesitation, we highly recommend staying in this beautiful home! A great location, beautiful scenery out back, not to mention a well appointed home! The living space opens to a wonderful deck area as well as a hot tub tucked in around the corner giving privacy. You may even be greeted with a wonderful bottle of wine from the owners vineyard !"
32018098,768158993,2021-06-08,89683070,Ashley,Patricia and Joe’s place was absolutely beautiful and the perfect location and house for spending time with our immediate family. Their master bedroom/bathroom is so nice and the amenities were plentiful in each room and space. The outside patio and little organic garden was wonderful and we got to eat some fresh grown strawberries! I definitely recommend to anyone visiting the Salem area!
32018098,402216596555095871,2021-07-08,118722218,Danny,"This place is wonderful, from the thoughtful suggestions to the comfortable beds and beautiful spacious house.  I would most definitely recommend this house."

32018098,424633197078912789,2021-08-08,397694028,April,This home is beautiful! Plenty of space indoor and outdoor for a family. The kitchen is fully equipped for whatever you may need. The master bathroom is amazing and the hidden workout/tv room is a hidden gem. The staircase was a little scary for toddlers so bring baby gates if you can. Otherwise we loved our stay!
32018098,428325184485064244,2021-08-13,53982309,Thomas,"We enjoyed staying at this beautiful home in the heart of the Willamette valley.  Home was immaculate with plenty of space to relax as a family.  We especially  loved the backyard —- gorgeous roses, private oasis, comfortable seating areas surrounded by greenery. Master bedroom also incredibly comfortable with many amenities, including large master bath with dual vanities and dual showerheads. House was exactly as pictured and described in the listing. Thanks Patricia & Joe!"

32018098,440583527482948231,2021-08-30,60242303,Lindsay,"The house offered a great backyard space with the hot tub, fire pit and seating area for everyone. It was a good location: close to downtown, silver falls and wineries. Inside was clean and comfortable. The beds were comfortable, and showers updated with great water pressure. The easy check out process was nice as Patricia didn’t require a lot of work for us. I would recommend her house."

32018098,450059319422523075,2021-09-12,27815747,Tim,A beautiful home with plenty of space. The view out the backyard is serene and peaceful. There were 5 Adults staying at the property and we all felt like we had enough privacy to re-charge yet we could connect with each other to discuss things. The Hot Tub was a bonus that I enjoyed everyday.  Overall a great home in an ideal location for my travel purposes.
32018098,453619474175310040,2021-09-17,154116350,Jeremiah,We have stayed here several times and appreciate all that the house has to offer. Communication has been stellar and I would highly recommend this place.

The backyard is beautiful and the pictures don’t do it justice - loved the fire pit and hot tub areas especially. The master bedroom is wonderful, especially the double master shower. It was a perfect place to stay with two other couples for an Oregon wine country trip. We visited in the off season and were gifted with perfect weather and this gem of a house."

We were able to see some goats and llamas which our child enjoyed. The house was well equipped. We stayed for 2 weeks and had everything we needed. The hot tub was a plus! The master bathroom was big and had two rain shower heads. The beds were comfortable also. The location was perfect in a quiet and safe neighborhood close to a lot of stores and restaurants. We had a relaxing time and truly enjoyed our stay. Thank you for being accommodating to all our requests.
32018098,608086798367691164,2022-04-18,448666769,William,A great place to stay. The pictures don't do justice to the house itself. I highly recommend staying there.

The house feels bigger than pictured, and is lovely in every respect. Lots of space. Comfortable beds. Beautiful master bath. Charming neighborhood. Scenic back yard, with room to spread out, cook a meal, relax, and take in Oregon. The house had everything our family of five needed for an enjoyable stay."

32018098,723973297799590225,2022-09-25,15581791,Raissa,"This is a lovely property - clean, quiet, and fully stocked with basic kitchen supplies. The hosts have really provided everything needed for a very pleasant stay. It has a rural feel with marvelous views from the back windows and yard and we spent a good deal of time just hanging out in the daytime and enjoying the fire pit in the evening. Wi-Fi was good;  a few of us had to put in some work hours and it functioned well.  The “office” provided an added bonus for making calls.<br/><br/>Wine country is close by.  We didn’t take advantage of this as much as we would have liked but the hosts are able to advise as needed!  The house is on a nice cul-de-sac and is very central; grocery stores etc. are just a short drive away. Thumbs up to “Roger That” BBQ which is close by.  Check their hours - they’re limited - but it’s a tasty feed if you can fit it in."

32018098,768953743828570448,2022-11-26,3391960,Casey,"One of our top Airbnbs, ever. Spent a week for a family thanksgiving. The house is lovely and well appointed. Plenty of room for all and we even had everything we needed for gourmet cooking, which can often be sparse in the rentals. It has lovely views, and with multiple fireplaces was super cosy to read and relax by. Great location for wine tasting, and the owners also have a lovely winery if you fancy a nice Oregon Pinot. We will be back!"
32018098,783434738555177792,2022-12-16,260049108,Carmela,"the House was Beautiful and we especially loved the view of the from the picture window of the backyard area.

32133603,411240507,2019-02-11,187388346,Katie,"Amanda's apartment is beautiful, located downtown and a short walk away from almost everything! The creek outside is gorgeous, and we had a great time drinking cocoa and coffee and watching the snow fall during our stay! Amanda was friendly and helpful, all of her communication was really informative and she went out of her way to make sure we were happy with the place and had everything we needed. A gem of a place in Salem!"
32133603,414767175,2019-02-20,177483886,Alan,The pictures don’t do this place justice. Very quaint and quiet as well as a great location. We will be staying here on all our trips to Salem.
32133603,416646058,2019-02-24,53761227,Hailey,Amanda was very quick to respond. The space is right next to a creek which was really nice. The apartment is huge and there was coffee! Always a plus!
32133603,420774080,2019-03-07,38608512,Tammy,"Relaxing, peaceful, creek side setting in the middle of the city! It was surprisingly quiet and it was a nice, home like condo where we had everything we needed to cook our own meals. It was so nice to be able to have our dog with us, as well! The host was flexible and willing to work with us, as our situation changed and we needed to stay a bit longer and add an extra vehicle. Very reasonable price for the stay, also. Highly recommend!"
32133603,426049066,2019-03-19,39870622,Scott,"Very walkable to downtown amenities. Pleasant space. Great coffee drinking spot on patio above creek, weather permitting."

Quick and simple check in also got to park in the back. Home was comfy, clean and perfect. The kitchen was stocked had plenty utensils, pots and whatnot. The best part was the sound of the water I enjoyed that very much ! The balcony was very peaceful. My dog was super happy plenty of space for her to run around. Will deft be coming back in the future ! Thank you Amanda"
32133603,431783939,2019-04-01,7805901,Eric,"This Airbnb was clean, spacious, near the center of town and campus, and quiet.  Lovely location in that it was right overlooking a brook, it felt a bit desolate late at night when we would come home, and there were some street people about, but that was not a problem.  The only criticism we have is that the amenities were fine, but very minimal.  Unlike many air bnbs that we have stayed at it is really a full time rental space so felt a bit like a hotel.  But everything was comfortable, just don't expect books, food in the fridge/cupboards etc."
32133603,432405057,2019-04-03,96485737,Will,Quick responses from a friendly host. She was very friendly and accommodating and responded quickly to food and fun recommendations.
32133603,436273125,2019-04-12,68902419,Margie,"This place was great! Clean, near downtown and my favorite yoga studio and the offices I need to visit while working in Salem! Amanda responded quickly to any questions and the check in was smooth and easy! It is roomy, a great place on Mill Creek with a beautiful view, quiet, warm and comfortable. The kitchen is stocked with everything I needed if I did not want to go out to eat. I will definitely be back!"
32133603,439300860,2019-04-18,57390596,Luke,"When my corporate employer said the hotels were full in the local area, I saw it as an opportunity. I knew there were options in and around Church St, but I found a little gem with this place. Simple, elegant, and right on the Mill River. Amanda was quick to respond, answered any questions I had promptly and accurately. I was within walking distance to food, entertainment and my meetings, making it very convenient for my three-night stay. I will be staying here again next time I'm in Salem. 👌"
32133603,442057986,2019-04-22,92876106,Oralia,"Pictures don’t so this location justice. The unit is very clean and has many amenities! If we’re ever back, we will definitely book again."
32133603,442903588,2019-04-24,204077076,Patricia,"Great location, near downtown. Loved the creek view from the porch. Will definitely stay here again.."

32133603,445664764,2019-04-29,247348267,Liane,Quiet neighborhood and the creek is absolutely amazing
32133603,447479034,2019-05-03,57820866,Jeanne,"Clean, convenient, reasonably comfortable. I was surprised by how much difference it made to not have any decoration at all in the place (as noted by another reviewer); it does take away from the experience. And I was really looking forward to staying by the creek, but turns out we had a fine view of the apartment complex on the other side, including someone's exterior floodlights that never shut off. We ended up having to shut all the blinds/curtains - so much for enjoying the creek. That said, it was indeed very clean and convenient to the Capitol, and the host was immediately responsive to my messages to schedule a stay."
32133603,450217823,2019-05-08,186701666,Tiffany & Ben,"Exactly what we needed, friendly & hot back to us quickly!"

32133603,456523882,2019-05-21,41456198,William,"This was a great rental.  The Mill Creek runs along the entire back of the property and if you open the windows, the sound of the running creek transforms the space.  Parking is private and convenient. Getting access to the property is very easy and straightforward.  Beds were comfortable, kitchen has all the necessities.  We were traveling with a senior who has issues with steps and this property made our stay very easy for her.  Thanks Amanda."
32133603,457283766,2019-05-23,63949218,Michelle,"Clean, convenient, quiet, cozy.  Everything you want in a home away from home. Easy to find and close to everything. Can get as much or as little rushing water noise from creekside windows in both bedrooms. Makes for greatly restful sleep. Not too foofy, very minimalistic which we loved. Mr had spacious table inside and outside for working remotely. Great place, recommend for 2 couples, family and level entry for mobility challenged.  Each br has an adjoining bath. Just enough space and primacy for 2-4 people. Recommended."
32133603,457724891,2019-05-24,153830730,Wayne,The apartment was great!<br/><br/>We loved the balcony overlooking the creek!

32133603,461050934,2019-05-30,68902419,Margie,"Amanda's place is becoming my home-away-from-home place when I need to work in Salem. It has everything I need for a comfortable stay, close to the offices I need to visit, close to downtown and the yoga studio I enjoy. The condo is clean and has a wonderful patio to sit and listen to the creek and relax after a long day of work. Amanda is quick to respond and take care of any needs!"

32133603,475099692,2019-06-23,200658456,Maryanne And Chalie,We didn’t stay at Amanda’s due to a chemical smell. Amanda was gracious and gave us a full refund.
32133603,477164625,2019-06-27,233329738,LeighLee,This is an amazing gem of a place. It accommodated our larger size family and also allows us to entertain our local family for breakfast. We absolutely loved the sleeping to the sounds of the creek flowing by and having our meals on the patio with the creek flowing next to us. Amanda  was always available and willing to help us with any questions. Loved this place !!
32133603,488896106,2019-07-15,64086027,Kerry,"Spacious condo with many wonderful features! We especially enjoyed walking to many of the downtown sights: restaurants, shopping, and events that Salem offers. The creek side location is beautiful and  the condo was dog friendly which meant we could ALL enjoy Salem:)! Since we stayed for two weeks, I also appreciated the laundry room!"
32133603,489962045,2019-07-17,4169516,Carmen,"The house was clean and spacious.  Plenty of extra towels and linens.  The back deck by the creek is a huge plus. To be able to have breakfast listening to the water running and the birds chirping was priceless.  <br/>Location is perfect if you don’t want to drive around, lot of places were within walking distance.  We did not walk, but the area seems safe.<br/>When you get to the house, make sure you follow the instructions Amanda gives you to find the parking spot.  It is very tricky and I didn’t walk to the alley to see what it actually looked like, so it was hard for me to find it."
32133603,493612574,2019-07-22,7436419,Aaron,Incredible balcony and creek.  Makes a wonderful natural grey noise for sleeping.   Feels like your in the mountains.  Great place for my dog and I.  Hosts made sure I could park my tall van.
32133603,501525418,2019-08-03,5547648,Barbara,"The apartment is very spacious.  It is very well located and less than a mile from a mall, a movie theater, and a farmer's market.  It also is close to several restaurants.  I would stay here again when I'm in Salem and would recommend it to others."

32133603,548068908,2019-10-16,298332571,Tara,"The location was convenient, the beds were comfortable but it smelt like an old smokey or musty hotel room.  Good for the value but be aware that it does smell."
32133603,552471316,2019-10-21,50784005,Tara,"The apartment was lovely and exceptionally clean. I was able to hear the creek outside my window while I was falling asleep which was especially nice. The gas fireplace was very cozy on a blustery day, and there were plenty of extra pillows, blankets, and towels provided as well!"
32133603,553683745,2019-10-24,27847375,Julie,"Amanda’s condo is spacious, clean and well equipped. Our visit was short, just one night. We really appreciated the coffee and filters so we could get our fix before heading out! The view of the creek and the trees in their fall colors was lovely."

The condo is nicely remodeled and roomy, and the back deck is a perfect morning coffee retreat, as the sounds of the creek are such a relaxing backdrop! Amanda is easy to communicate with, and responded to our questions promptly and courteously."

32133603,721725750,2021-01-03,156267276,Claudia,"Amanda is an amazing communicator. we had no issue whatsoever looking for this place and the details of everything. never being in Oregon you can truly get confused going into downtown. But not us! super thankful for precise information with everything. The location was perfect for us. Best past is being right on the creek. loved listening to the river at night. So soothing. beds and rooms were cozy. amenities were great and I loved that there was even trail guides, City guides, books, games movies for the nights we fid stay in. This place is right in downtown too and alot of places are small walks away.. We will be staying here again the next time we are in Salem."
32133603,722000488,2021-01-04,270251210,David,"This place was very clean and well kept with nice, comfy furniture.  Even my discerning wife loved everything about this place!   This condo gave my family an oasis of joy during a difficult road trip. Thank you!"

32133603,737632347,2021-03-08,115175987,Katherine,"The apartment was bigger than what I expected and you can tell a lot of thought went into what was provided, from toiletries to games and movies! I only spent a night and we wish we could’ve spent more and enjoyed the beautiful creek."
32133603,738142909,2021-03-11,388120354,Beth,"I was so pleased with this stay! Despite being a condo in the city this stay felt relaxing and far away. I loved the view, the space, and the price! <br/><br/>I needed to ask for a couple of accommodations, including getting lost (!), but I got fast and kind help. I'm so thankful."

32133603,740692315,2021-03-20,225615760,Patricia,"We had a short notice trip to check out Oregon colleges as daughter received word of scholarship awards. Grandparents really wanted to come too. And then there is COVID. Our second floor apartment was ever so clean and cozy and had everything we needed to eat in and was perfectly located to pick up all the great local food from downtown. You can walk to the capital and shops. Beautiful view of creek from deck. Complex was quiet and kind. It was a wonderful stay and this little home made the trip fun, easy, way affordable to hotels. Beds are comfy. So much fun to be in a neighborhood so close to so much!!!"
32133603,742166412,2021-03-25,13858916,Ainise,"Amanda, your place was sooooo amazing! We enjoyed our stay tremendously! Your checkin and check out directions were spot on and so helpful to our time in Oregon. Thank you for being so thoughtful in every inch of your house. Blessings!"
32133603,743289089,2021-03-28,213755765,Brandi,Beautiful house! Loved the creek that ran right by the house. Enjoyed the window open at night to be able to listen to it. Nice balcony to relax on while sipping a cocktail and listening to the creek. Very clean! Comfortable beds. Pet friendly. So we could bring our fur baby. Will absolutely stay here again!

32133603,748316796,2021-04-12,73359351,Carol,"Have stayed at this location twice now and will stay again the next time in Salem.  Close to shopping and parks.  Beds are very comfortable and the amenities are up to date.  The host always has a full kitchen, including spices and little extras that help when cooking.  The creek outside the sliding doors lends an outdoor feel to the place and cuts down on the city noise too."
32133603,749194087,2021-04-16,345348216,David,Thanks again!
32133603,749488195,2021-04-17,65372824,Lynnae,"If you find yourself in Salem, this is a great place to stay. Easy parking, easy access to the first floor door and a great view of the creek.  Plenty of space in bedrooms and essentials in the kitchen and bath."

32133603,756838831,2021-05-09,1135968,Kendra,"The pictures do not do the place justice!  It's sparkling clean with lots of extra amenities, if you forget your toothbrush or shampoo you are covered!  Location is right near downtown making it very walkable.<br/><br/>The creekside location makes it very restful and all of the furniture and furnishings are super comfy.<br/><br/>Amanda was prompt with responses and her check in / check out information was really helpful!<br/><br/>Would totally stay again. <br/><br/>Bonus, dog friendly! (even though we left our pups at home, great to know we could have brought them!)"
32133603,757825565,2021-05-13,339046731,Linda,"We enjoyed our stay, and the place is comfortable and quiet.  Location worked very well for us.  The covered parking was nice.  Enjoyed the creek by the condo.  We would definitely stay here again.  Amanda was really good at answering all of our questions before we booked."
32133603,760776093,2021-05-21,124513323,Nina,wished we could have stayed a few more nights. had a difficult time finding but loved everything about the place once we found it.

32133603,765489038,2021-06-01,87319346,Dionne,"This is a great spot to relax and explore Salem! Plenty of room for everyone, close to everything and you can’t beat the awesome back patio right on the creek! Enjoy your coffee or dinner with the beautiful view and lulling water sounds."
32133603,390590886242939932,2021-06-22,394320520,Nohelani,Great first experience to using Airbnb ! the creek view was very relaxing.
32133603,416685913174639023,2021-07-28,392992381,Ginger,"Excellent experience. All is just as described. The creek is the greatest, and there is a beautiful canopy of trees over the porch. Very peaceful and restful. The condo is nicely appointed with every amenity you could possibly need. The owner and on site manager couldn't be nicer or more accommodating.<br/>This is a rare quality of service and facility rarely found."
32133603,418132085960007676,2021-07-30,134006236,Maurice,"Accurately and honestly described, we had no issues whatsoever, the place is spacious and convenient."
32133603,419638225439575021,2021-08-01,373087587,Samantha,"This place was easy to find and exactly as the listing stated, check-in was easy. Nicely decorated and the perfect size for my family of five. The deck was great for our breakfast and the creek was peaceful. Would stay here again!"

32133603,431872265536897120,2021-08-18,213376087,Shelby,"This place was great. Just what we needed for our 2 nights in Salem. Lots of blankets and super soft bed sheets! Loved that there was coffee to make too! Not in the best area of town, but we felt safe the whole time! The creek sounds and view were nice! Thanks again!"
32133603,432670691962114297,2021-08-19,261571498,Aaron,"Lots of space, clean and peaceful on the creek.  We didn't have time to explore the neighborhood so can't comment on that particularly."
32133603,438414431117691601,2021-08-27,225615760,Patricia,The best Air BnB in our experience. Close to downtown shopping and restaurants. Close to the university and capital and art museum. Easy drive to Portland. Super cozy and well appointed. Lots of room. Love it!!!! So much better than a hotel. Thank you! Our third time staying in one of Amanda's two Salem apartments. Both are wonderful.❤️💕❤️💕❤️
32133603,442748400119562897,2021-09-02,309504631,Laurie,Great place. clean and spacious.  was perfect for our trip.
32133603,444187349624919253,2021-09-04,184908148,Olesya,"Our stay was amazingly convenient and fun for having two dogs! The place is quite spacious, there’s a beautiful view of the brook from the deck and almost every window! All our amenities were met! We like the temperature a bit low, and they had a killer AC unit that allowed us to make it as cool as we (and our dogs 😂) like it! Super pet friendly spot if your dogs are at slightly well behaved!(: We could have had two more people stay with us and been comfortable even with our dogs!"
32133603,450060021138040656,2021-09-12,47116965,Darlene,"The apartment was absolutely wonderful and we found Amanda to be a very good and responsive host. The apartment was clean and comfortable and was stocked with just about everything we needed. We loved the little porch area overlooking the stream. We opted to stay in the bedroom with the window air conditioner which also blocked any noise from neighbors (it was Saturday night in a city after all). We were happy we had a private off-street parking spot given how close we were to the city folk milling about and nightlife. So, definitely a place to stay when in Salem."
32133603,454378312047628378,2021-09-18,134710450,Toni,"Clean and spacious. The back patio made the whole place, quiet and peaceful on the river."
32133603,455050807412948570,2021-09-19,328413912,Parin,Very clean quiet place on a beautiful location. Close to amenities & restaurants.
32133603,460885281196694995,2021-09-27,11789415,Malachi,"Great location, no issues."
32133603,465210152061554242,2021-10-03,12304290,Kevin,"Amanda is very courteous, responsive and clear in her communications through the Air BNB platform. The accommodations are well represented. This is a very classic 1960-70s modern apartment building that still maintains that vibe. It has been cleaned up nicely and have a lovely little balcony overlooking the creek below. I would stay here again when we need two bedrooms and a kitchen."
32133603,471101918715131941,2021-10-11,59620968,Cathy,"We enjoyed our stay in this condo. The galley kitchen had everything we needed in it.  The living area and bedrooms were spacious.  There were plenty of towels! The decor was calm and soothing.  Having the creek to look at and listen to was an added bonus especially after a day of sightseeing and hiking!  For us, being close to the town center and the state capitol was a definite plus.  We did see homeless encampments in this area, but we never felt unsafe.  In fact at night we would walk to the center of town for dinner.  Salem does have a nice foodie vibe!"
32133603,476801098748998922,2021-10-19,44207340,Bhavana,"Comfortable, spacious well equipped. Nice view of the creek. Enjoyed the kitchen supplies. Easy street parking."
32133603,479041315963288393,2021-10-22,34308406,Eric,The place was okay. Could use a little more attention to detail. No art up. You can tell it’s just an air BnB but that’s fine. No place to read. No lamps. But it was clean and it had the nice deck.
32133603,489186025047236036,2021-11-05,79769870,Roxanne,Great place and close to everything. Will stay again.
32133603,489918163602284038,2021-11-06,267056343,Judy,Loved staying here.  My favorite was the sound of the creek outside of our place.
32133603,492064469914359748,2021-11-09,84432126,Emily,"Comfortable beds, large living area. Questionable area as far as safety for traveling with children. Parking is a struggle for large vehicles and only street parking (timed) for any extra vehicle. Once you went outside on the patio next to the river, it was nice to feel like I wasn’t in downtown."
32133603,495025418215885418,2021-11-13,192538568,Payton,Wonderful clean place to stay!
32133603,495732288544264261,2021-11-14,110273070,Marlene,Would recommend. Great location very clean and tidy place love the sound of the Creek the deck is amazing very relaxing specially at night short distance for some essentials as well as dining 10/10 we loved our stay thank you so much for everything! hope to stay again in the future! such great host! This place is much convenient than expected!
32133603,516046943384054201,2021-12-12,428733155,Elsa,"The apartment was great fit for us, very comfortable. We enjoyed the house and creek behind it. <br/>Amanda was very communicative and responded fast"
32133603,531945764515319580,2022-01-03,431146890,Mary,"Great location downtown. Nice atmosphere with the creek right outside. Clean and welcoming.  Plenty of towels, comfy beds...the next best thing to being at home. Amanda was great...she kept in contact and was very clear about all aspects of the condo. I will definitely be staying with her again!"
32133603,533433549832335674,2022-01-05,438807322,Jose,Was just like the pictures! Super clean and the hosts made check in and check out very easy. The creek right outside was beautiful! Would 100% stay again
32133603,558737674868794350,2022-02-09,144723905,Stephanie,"I felt overall that this unit was a good value for what I received. I feel Amanda is very upfront about the area the unit is in, and what is available to you in the unit itself. The pictures are accurate, and not misleading at all. I greatly appreciated the detailed communication from Amanda before arriving at the unit, and also on the morning of check out. This helped me navigate everything I needed to know for arrival and getting settled in, as well as what to do upon checkout. <br/><br/>I enjoyed hearing the creek behind the unit, and on cooler nights the fireplace kept the living room warm. I also am in love with the softer bed in the back bedroom; so comfy for me, and the sheets were soft, too. If you like a firmer mattress, the front bedroom is probably for you. Each room (even the hall) has heat through baseboard heaters, so you can customize what you like. I used the smart tv in the living room, which was great for seeing the last episode of ""Reacher"". :) I didn't use any of the appliances in the kitchen, aside from the fridge and microwave, so I can't speak to that. But there were items there to use if you were cooking, and basic spices and oil in the cupboards. While I was staying there, I only saw one person the whole time, and things were nice and quiet overall. This location was only about 5 minutes from where I was attending a convention, so that was a plus for me! Yes, there are homeless people in the vicinity, but I didn't observe any issues when I was driving around, day or night (police, trash can fires, fights, panhandling, etc.). <br/><br/>IMO, this is a good place to stay if you are traveling for business or with one other person and using this spot as a home base. I would have liked at least one more lamp in the living room, because it is somewhat dark in the living room at night. I would book again if I needed to be in the area. :)"
32133603,561646032299994665,2022-02-13,43086406,Maya,"Amanda's place was great.  Her instructions were very clear, so we had no problem self-checkin and found the designated parking spot easily.  The rooms were very clean, and kitchen had everything we need.  The view from the living room was very nice.  It'd be very nice sitting in the patio if it was warmer seasons (we visited in Feb, so it was too cold to sit in the patio).  The location was the best!!  Walking distance to the downtown where all good restaurants are located.  When we come back to Salem, we will definitely stay in her place again."
32133603,568906864855343192,2022-02-23,116864949,Marina,great place. close to downtown. the river nearby is beautiful and serene.

32133603,576878715199150199,2022-03-06,132801393,Meg,"Amanda was a wonderful host! We were in town for a memorial service, and Amanda’s communication and clean apartment made the trip so much easier for us. I highly recommend their place and will look to stay there again next time we’re in town!"
32133603,581962765944704797,2022-03-13,72308547,Alicia,"Great value, location close to lots of activities and restaurants. Designated parking spot, spacious accommodations, lovely creek. Only issue was with communication, the issue has since been resolved."

32133603,591308790155099309,2022-03-26,4538321,Jeannie,"We had a ten-day stay at this unit and have nothing but good things to say. It’s in an older building, but very clean and up-to-date. Everything was in good working condition, kitchen is well-stocked, and we found everything we needed. Very roomy unit with near-by and well-lit parking. Conveniently located to stores and attractions in Salem (Capitol building, farmers’ market, Bush Pasture Park, etc.). We found this a very comfortable place so what more is there to say? Oh yes, the babbling sounds of Mill Creek provide pleasant “white noise” to lull you to sleep!"
32133603,597162017616290700,2022-04-03,143629309,Samantha,"Spent one night here, dog friendly. Creek right outside was nice to listen to."

32133603,617470655988244311,2022-05-01,138832582,Christian,"Definitely recommend staying here! Super nice and had a pleasant stay. It’s close to everything. Had a little issue when I got locked out, because the screen door automatically shut out on me, but they were very accommodating! They also removed that door so it won’t happen again. Great hosts!"
32133603,618201152014465098,2022-05-02,169724997,Tom,Great place to stay quiet private and close to downtown
32133603,622476771700306301,2022-05-08,270343981,Lupita,"A beautiful location with the river out back. It is a nice, simple and practical home that fit all of our needs this weekend! It was a wonderful stay, easy check out and clear instructions for that and for how to get to the parking in the back!"
32133603,625398161343894665,2022-05-12,222089778,Candace,"I have stayed at this property twice now, I love the airbnb, well stocked and very comfortable, has everything you will need. The deck is awesome to sit out in the evenings with the sound of the creek rushing by. I highly recommend this airbnb, Amanda is a wonderful host, I stay here anytime I find it not booked when I am in Oregon. Candace"
32133603,626104425005456138,2022-05-13,150474854,Kanye,Great place to stay with everything you’d need
32133603,631250563656213020,2022-05-20,458934414,Kerry,Thank you Amanda.
32133603,632648540129648440,2022-05-22,368354670,Marlene,"We had a wonderful stay. Place was clean, had plenty of towels, beds are comfortable. Enjoyed the fireplace as well as the creek! Kitchen is stocked well with amenities. Makeup towelettes, shampoo, conditioner and body soap were stocked. Close to downtown Salem , we walked around did some site seeing and enjoyed a few of the restaurants. I would definitely stay again! Oh and thank you for the popcorn :)"
32133603,633354813375946421,2022-05-23,459990686,Jim,"Very nice little spot, very clean with a great view"
32133603,636280871842117765,2022-05-27,262510801,Amanda,Cute and quant place. Clean. Adequately stocked of basics. Comfy beds. Loved the beautiful sound of the creek.
32133603,639236309137092284,2022-05-31,395163335,Emma,"Wish we could have stayed longer! We stayed here for last night of a trip and it was wonderful. The space was clean and cozy, and sleeping to the sound of the creek right outside was rejuvenating."
32133603,642868668494616908,2022-06-05,48977521,Erin,"Very spacious and serene spot near downtown Salem! Easy access to main roads and lots of restaurants and shopping near by. The neighbors were friendly and quiet, we barely heard any noise from the other condos. Lots of room to spread out and unpack, with a kitchen well equipped for cooking and a large dining table and scenic patio! Beds were decent and we had plenty of clean linens. Amanda was so gracious and accommodated an early check in for us which was so appreciated after a super early flight with a 5 year old! Great and friendly communication all around. Would stay here again!"
32133603,644318119114807677,2022-06-07,47296965,Mary,"Thanks to my excellent host, I was able to book this place at the last-minute. I was camping nearby when my tent flooded in a rainstorm and I needed some shelter until I could recover. Amanda was extremely responsive and helpful! I couldn’t have been more grateful for the clean, dry space and comfortable bed! Even if you’re not fleeing Mother Nature, I recommend this as a great choice at a great value. Don’t be fooled by the somewhat modest exterior of this building — once you’re inside this place is exceptionally charming! It’s spotlessly clean, spacious, and comfortable. One of the best features is the stream rushing below. You can sit on the balcony to enjoy it or just open the windows to hear the water. Be aware that if you have more than one vehicle, you may have some parking issues. There’s a dedicated space for one vehicle but other street parking is limited. I’ll mention a few other features that some may consider drawbacks (I do not): this is not an open floor plan, the rooms & hallway are somewhat awkwardly situated; the kitchen is relatively small with some older fixtures & appliances but all in perfect working order; the flat screen is a little small. Overall, this Airbnb was more than adequate and absolutely lovely. I would definitely stay here again."
32133603,647946560821191198,2022-06-12,67929414,Fran,"Amanda’s communication was good and  she was prompt in her responses . The apartment was spacious with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The neighbors were quiet, however, we awoke to evidence of a homeless person who had clearly been sleeping out front of our door. We did not feel like the neighborhood was the safest."
32133603,652907080066540502,2022-06-19,32206898,Charlotte,Our wedding guests stayed here for my wedding weekend. I rented 4 apartments in the complex from Amanda to host them. All of were happy!
32133603,653722695499251636,2022-06-20,99674141,Teresa,My husband and I had to make a stop in Salem from Los Ángeles and we were lucky enough to booked this place last minute. We arrive late at night and was easy to locate the place. We loved that it had a parking spot available for us which made things easier and safer especially when arriving late at night. Amanda was amazing in providing spot on instruction. The place was very clean and it had everything you needed for a comfortable stay. The balcony located right next to the river made a perfect spot for a delicious cup of coffee in the morning or anytime in the day. We definitely loved this place and we highly recommend it if you are visiting Salem.
32133603,656586679914508147,2022-06-24,181079954,Leilani,"The place was easy to find, directions and instruction were clear to understand. The deck was amazing right by the water and inside was very clean and beautiful! You wont regret the stay here.. Will definitely come back!!!"

32133603,674034571157478848,2022-07-18,75669516,Kate,"Loved this spot by the river, lovely to sit next to on the deck and listen to at night!"
32133603,681967163425249234,2022-07-29,470490721,Ty,We had a great time :)  It happened to be some of the hottest days of the year so the large portable AC unit was greatly appreciated.  It was already running when we arrived so it was plenty cool indoors.  The porch with the river view was beautiful and definitely the highlight of the place.
32133603,683489283118955348,2022-07-31,305743916,Jessica,The house was great. If your staying in the summer it only has one ac unit in the master bedroom. Other wise it was a great house and Amanda was wonderful in every way.
32133603,692072964806773670,2022-08-12,350749522,Kimberly,Amanda did everything she could to ensure our stay met our expectations
32133603,694285518117784460,2022-08-15,431146890,Mary,"Comfortable and well appointed.  Since it's downtown,  close to a lot of what you need. Very roomy, and the creek flowing outside gives it a resort feel.  My 2nd stay here, and not my last!"
32133603,695700708495498869,2022-08-17,296187565,Susan,Wonderful place.  Convenient location.  Great to have easy access to designated parking spot.  The creek was wonderful to listen to at night. Like a lullaby.  Spotlessly clean.  Well and thoughtfully equipped.  Outstanding responsiveness and communication.  Would absolutely repeat stay!!
32133603,699352143914172982,2022-08-22,119582779,Hardik,"The AirBnb was conveniently located in the heart of downtown Salem, close to plenty of places for brunch and explore. The place itself is right next to a creek with a soothing sound of running water, and patio to sit and enjoy your morning/evening tea or coffee. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Willamette Valley area."
32133603,700762948824571930,2022-08-24,233425740,Nathan,"The stream was nice, and the place worked well for our brief stay to drop off our son for the start up of school. There were a large number of homeless individuals around , one even staying right by parking."

32133603,729012400372471400,2022-10-02,177867515,Drew,We needed just one night to break up a longer trip. The kids loved the rainbow goldfish and hot chocolate provided! Great back deck with creek.  Amanda was incredibly easy to communicate with and provide additional information when requested!
32133603,737047083800727174,2022-10-13,477015602,Robert,Great communication and a wonderful experience. Great value and very helpful. Would definitely stay again. Thank you!

32133603,741364658033169914,2022-10-19,26112699,Thomas,The condo is spacious and clean. The creek is beautiful and nearby shopping at Salem Center is very convenient. We loved Minto Brown Island park.

32133603,752976909837390430,2022-11-04,23851153,Mary,"Convenient location, close to lots of restaurants, downtown area. Great to have off-street and covered parking close to the front door.  Full kitchen very well-supplied with dishes, pots, utensils.  Quiet for sleep.  The creek was audible!  Safe mixed-use neighborhood. Nice linens and furniture. The temperature is adjustable for each room--very convenient for individuals.  Plenty of hot water.  Probably will be in Salem more  over next couple of years, so hope the unit will still be available.  Salem downtown is clearly appreciated and maintained--beautiful old buildings."
32133603,754424850506136383,2022-11-06,130927939,Starla,This place was clean and centrally located. Parking was easy. We will stay again when we come back to Salem.
32133603,755869794835970136,2022-11-08,11050754,Christine,"My mom can’t walk up stairs, so this one level was a great 2 bedroom, 2 bath stay for us, but then add in that beautiful creek and it was just perfection! It had been very rainy, so the sound of the rushing water at night and then sitting on the porch with the beautiful fall trees was the perfect relaxation we needed. Everything was very clean, nicely remodeled unit. Instant communication with the owner. Felt very safe there even when I was by myself. 5 stars for everything!"
32133603,758844975951094173,2022-11-12,371300580,Virginia,"The apartment was perfect. Had everything we needed. Very accommodating, and thoughtful."

All if our needs were adequately met, of we are in the area again we will definitely call on you."
32133603,768187759841639860,2022-11-25,4300438,D. Shawn,This was a great unit at a very reasonable price. Amanda was communicative and provided great instructions.

32133603,784127328039472055,2022-12-17,1665871,Cathy,"Very nice spacious apartment!  The kitchen is well equipped.  Comfortable beds.  Nice to have two baths - one with tub shower, one with walk-in.  I really appreciated being able to regulate the temperatures separately in each bedroom and the other spaces.  Amanda was super responsive to questions.  Even though the apartment is downtown it's very quiet on the creek and sits off the alley, rather than the street so the only cars that approach are those of the people who live in the complex."
32133603,787079821101032321,2022-12-21,432750081,Rayme,"Have stayed in Amanda's properties 7 times now. Always wonderful.  Clean, super comfortable beds, great price. This is where I stay ALWAYS!"

We are very appreciative that she was able to accommodate our doggie to stay with us. Her place is very clean and welcoming.  We will definitely be staying at Amanda place again.

32133603,813924768260684943,2023-01-27,495539922,Walter,In the Master Bedroom it had an ant issue. The ants were coming from the base board on the wall to the condo on the other side. Emailed Amanda and she had someone come over and spray. super fast and took care of the issue. <br/><br/>Other than that it was a great stay!! <br/>Heaters in every room including the bathrooms. I liked the fact the heater was under the towels so when I got out of the shower it was like I was at a spa with heated towels!!
32133603,815286741609316341,2023-01-29,115844461,Tamarah,Perfect stay while we attended the fest at the fairgrounds.  <br/>Everything we needed was there!  <br/>Definitely worth the money.

32133603,826172854010293701,2023-02-13,348426291,Angela Jaramillo,"Very responsive. We booked last minute at a late hour and host was quick to respond to our messages. <br/><br/>Respect to details. When I saw the first message I was like “woah” a lot but after ready I was like “woahhhhh, she is reading my mind”. Answered everything before I got a chance to ask. Very helpful host"
32133603,827660967023711553,2023-02-15,500540940,Leona,This space was close to our meeting area. Which was very convenient. Very quiet and peaceful. I easily feel asleep to the sound of the creek.
32133603,830576038305705926,2023-02-19,275528417,Donald,Easy access to local wine country!!

32133603,842136581787445557,2023-03-07,498910637,Bob,It worked. The heating was hard to figure out and the fireplace didn't work. It met our need.
32133603,843617632872433481,2023-03-09,247790132,Andrea,Amanda was super.  Responsive and accommodating and very thorough. The place was clean and exactly as described. I would definitely stay again!  Andrea
32133603,845725291554217891,2023-03-12,115217656,Rachael,"Bargain price with corresponding quality. The biggest issue was an ant infestation. Considering it is early March and still cold, there shouldn’t have been ants coming out of the shower drain and seemingly through the master bedroom wall. Found ants throughout the apartment but extensively in the master bedroom bed and bath (including sheets and pillow). Not biting ants but still… <br/>There also were people living on the balcony across the creek. Coolers, bbq, sofa and all. Also someone sleeping in a sleeping bag in the car port spot next to ours. I guess that is normal is western Oregon? <br/>Other than the unexpected sleeping guest, the parking was good… once you found it. Carport at the end of a dead end alley that doesn’t come up on GPS. But once found, the secluded parking was a big benefit! <br/>The kitchen was stocked with basics and snacks which was helpful. <br/>Overall, A decent enough place to crash while spending the day out enjoying the sites but wouldn’t book here again."
32133603,848621449613227278,2023-03-16,458829711,Michael,The place was centrally located to where I needed to be it was great I love the view of the river I had a great time I would be back. thank you
32133603,850806034077985872,2023-03-19,470638349,Cassandra,"I loved the creek! Amanda was very helpful when we wanted to an another night to our stay. Loved that they had quality toilet paper and even makeup wipes, and finally stayed in a place that provided extra towels!! Great attention to detail!!!"
32318245,419805494,2019-03-04,23152933,Jenny,This space was fantastic. The furniture was super comfy and we had plenty of space to land in. We appreciated the space between bedrooms and the kitchen was well appointed. It was convenient to downtown Salem and the privacy was great. We will definitely stay here again when we come back to Salem.
32318245,424435052,2019-03-16,191594094,Margaret,"Lillian's cottage was perfect for us!  We were visiting the area (where we had previously lived and worked) so we knew the location would be perfect.  Easy trips to the south, west, and north were important and this location fit the bill.  What we didn't know about the location was the quality of the dog park and overall park just a minute or two away.  What a beautiful park it is, we spent a lot of time with our dog there. A walk along the Willamette River restores body and soul.<br/><br/>Location aside, the cottage was very appealing.   The house has tremendous character and charm and it has been very wonderfully appointed with decoration and function.  The kitchen works great, the technology works wonderfully.  It is spacious and cheerful, one feels at home right away.<br/><br/>Lillian was a very gracious hostess, we couldn't recommend this any more highly."
32318245,425673461,2019-03-18,244790944,Ryan,"This is a fantastic house! Very comfortable and lots of space. Beds were cozy. it’s in a very private area, but you’re also close to downtown. We appreciated the extra thought she put into making us feel at home ( the chocolates and snack😜) . Would definitely stay here again if we’re in the area!! 👍🏼👍🏼"
32318245,428299663,2019-03-24,51334510,Barbara,"A wonderful home.  A lot thought was put in to making this a home away from home.  The owners thought of everything you may need and also every comfort.  The kitchen was very well stocked with everything for cooking meals,  It was very stylish and my 12 year grandson loved the loft. With the bedrooms on each side of the home it was private but yet it was open and spacious."
32318245,429702800,2019-03-28,46774039,Scott,Great quiet spot to spread out and relax. Lillian and Joshua are the perfect hosts and could not have been more gracious.

32318245,433072090,2019-04-05,23152933,Jenny,This was our second stay and it was great. We love the space and the separate and spacious bedrooms worked really well with our young kids who go to bed early. The location has worked well for us when we visit Salem too.
32318245,434869486,2019-04-08,99530132,Susan,"The cottage was clean and nicely laid out where you could have some privacy, but also common areas where all guest could comfortably come together and play games or hang out.  The place is also pretty private with no neighbors right next door.  <br/><br/>I would definitely stay here again."
32318245,435215102,2019-04-09,242787393,Molly,Perfect location! Great for our family with two young kiddos to get away. Very central location and close to Minto Brown Park which was a big hit with the kids and our dog. Nicely appointed with everything we needed for our stay. We will definitely be back!

32318245,436263645,2019-04-12,41951592,Janeen,this is a nice quiet place.  the hosts are very helpful.  its close to parks and town and museums
32318245,437519534,2019-04-14,162277566,Cassie,The place is very clean and quite spacious. Lillian was quick and friendly on replies. And we had a great (short) visit and would highly recommend for a group in Salem.
32318245,439837651,2019-04-19,47866016,Joy,Great space for our group. Everyone was comfortable and had a lovely stay.
32318245,441245215,2019-04-21,148159548,Janet,"Great place.  Super clean, comfortable and spacious with easy access to all Salem has to offer."
32318245,442924698,2019-04-24,8125063,Linda,"Very clean place, lots of space, convenient to a lot of restaurants and Fred Meyers as well as Trader Joe’s. I missed my Trader Joe’s. Very nice & beautiful place."
32318245,450195181,2019-05-08,74058270,Michele,Great stay. Cute and stylish. Very quiet. We had a temporary problem with the WiFi and Lillian and Josh were really fast to investigate and fix. Great directions to find the place and check in process. Will definitely stay again.
32318245,453026717,2019-05-14,156056144,Cindy,Lillian is a wonderful hostess and we hope to stay again. The house is clean and well furnished. All you need for a cozy stay over a weekend or longer.
32318245,454191038,2019-05-17,55550551,Rachel,Very clean! Overall a great experience for our stay in Salem!
32318245,456132377,2019-05-20,202893803,Kim,"This house is in a great location (read the directions provided to find it).  Close to everything we needed and well appointed.  While the house has easy access for older occupants, there is a step up into one of the bedrooms and there isn’t a walk-in shower.  Otherwise roomy, clean and plenty of parking.  We didn’t bring a dog but the field out back makes it easy to provide some outdoor exercise for a pooch."
32318245,459066380,2019-05-26,118091059,Sarah,"Lillian has done a fantastic job making this space so cute, inviting, and cozy. The huge couch in the living room was more than enough room for my family to comfortably have a movie night. The light and soft paint colors make the space feel huge, and the lovely touches like flowers and throw blankets make the space so inviting. We loved having a keurig, and the kitchen had all the tools we needed. This will be our airbnb every time we visit family in Salem! :)"
32318245,459824878,2019-05-27,90055389,Kelley,"Perfect space for our group! The place was clean, spacious and comfortable!"
32318245,465400967,2019-06-07,255880442,Carmen,"The house was very open, clean, and stylish. Comfortable and convenient!"
32318245,466951012,2019-06-09,249768235,Connie,Lillian was very responsive and nice about everything. Just know that you do not have TV unless you have Netflix or etc. We also had a big ant problem which someone would have to know about. It was a nice place other than those things.
32318245,467709061,2019-06-10,109515384,Levi,"Nice house, has everything in."
32318245,469017592,2019-06-13,74058270,Michele,Second stay and hope to be back. Quiet and comfortable. Great place to stay.
32318245,475696047,2019-06-24,249121313,Susan,"Fantastic place! Clean, convenient to lots of places  and very spacious. We stayed for two weeks with our 4 1/2 year old granddaughter who lives in Dallas Oregon she did not want us to leave. We highly recommend this beautiful home."
32318245,481922968,2019-07-05,62678713,Arpit,Very nice place and easy to find and check in.
32318245,486461224,2019-07-12,123932425,Helen,A great place to stay! Quiet area but easy access to so much. The host did a great job of making sure our needs were met! Fantastic!
32318245,488949988,2019-07-15,254555745,Robin,This home has a very comfortable and private home away from home setting. It is very clean and has alot of room for guests.
32318245,494170296,2019-07-23,1403322,Shani,We had a very comfortable stay.  It's super quiet and close to everything.   Communication was great and a nice large space.  Thanks Lillian!
32318245,495218655,2019-07-25,28655434,Nathan,Good place to stay.  Close to amenities but still quiet.
32318245,498964246,2019-07-30,54800516,Matthew,If you're looking for a clean and very well located place to stay while in Salem this is the place! Close to a lot of places to eat and downtown Salem. Thanks Lillian
32318245,514214589,2019-08-20,191594094,Margaret,"This was our second time staying in Lillian's place.   We love it there!  While the location fits our needs wonderfully, with so many choices we wouldn't have stayed again if the house itself wasn't so nice.  It is quiet, roomy, warm (for March when we were there first) and cool (for those 90 degree days that we had in August!)  Everything you need is there, there is plenty of space for families and/or guests.  For those with dogs (like us) the dog park down the road just a mile or so is fabulous.  If you don't have dogs, the park is still a wonderful place to visit, miles and miles of trails for hiking and biking right along the Willamette River.<br/><br/>We have traveled all over the West and this is one of our favorite homes, if not the favorite, that we have rented."
32318245,516002199,2019-08-23,170553258,Dina,"The cottage well clean and well cared for. It’s close enough to town and Willamette University (10 minutes), but far enough to be very peaceful and quiet. The separated sleeping areas were a bonus for us, as they allowed a lot of privacy. We enjoyed our stay."
32318245,517666061,2019-08-25,265516433,Douglas,"Stylish, clean and comfortable, we had a great one night stay."
32318245,520043005,2019-08-29,52707377,Jane,Conveniently located to everything you could need.
32318245,522262317,2019-09-01,122528162,Gloria,A very spacious cottage.  Lillian responded quickly to my inquiries.
32318245,524307258,2019-09-05,274311001,Holly,"Lillian's place was cute, we enjoyed our time there.  If you know smart TV, you'll be ok.  AC didn't cool the whole place very well though.  But it was so convenient to friends we were visiting, so worked for us."
32318245,526965007,2019-09-09,160181216,Linda,"Lovely place in a nice quiet location.  Just be careful not to lock yourself out like I did late at night in the rain. The door locks automatically when closed, and it is very easy to do."
32318245,572456225,2019-12-02,76661950,Suzanne,"We had a fantastic time at Lillian’s. There’s a lovely park and trail up the street, which we frequented each morning. The home was spotless and very nicely decorated. Thanks again, Lillian!"
32318245,585352709,2019-12-31,113904696,Connie,"Comfortable cottage in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood of Salem.  The house is located behind a small, 2-business office complex, not far from Downtown Salem.  The attorney's office and small management office will not affect your stay.  They are quiet only there during business hours.  It is also very convenient for shopping.  We were there for the birth of our Grandchild and it was very close to the Salem Hospital, which made it very convenient for us to go back and forth.  The price is more than fair for what the cottage offers.  There are two nice size bedrooms.  The Master is large and has a large sofa sectional to relax with a large television on the wall.  There is no cable TV but there are videos and both TV's are Smart TV's so if you have any streaming services, it will work fine. The Master bath is large but does not have a shower/bath.  You will have to use the second bathroom in the house to bathe.  The second Bedroom is nice size and is located on the opposite side of the Living Room, which is nice for couples and children.  It is nice to have a washer/dryer in the house.  There is a small kitchen but very useful.  We stayed in the house for three weeks and it was good for cooking simple meals.  I would recommend this house for two couples or a small family.  The host, Lillian, is very attentive and helpful.  She is quick to respond to your questions and helpful if you need anything.  We would definitely stay in this home again and recommend it."
32318245,588544381,2020-01-04,50949160,Paige,"Great place, close to downtown and easy to get to everything in Salem."
32318245,592704293,2020-01-13,255845032,Eunice,"We loved everything about the cottage, it’s bigger than we expected! Very clean, very cozy. Each room and bathroom comes with heaters which is great!"
32318245,594092340,2020-01-17,28345669,Chris,The Croisan Cottage was an amazing home with very stylish furnishings. Lillian was very responsive to any needs during the stay. I would recommend this home to anyone looking for a quiet and and serene location.
32318245,598728540,2020-01-27,163843937,Doyce,"This wonderful house is spotless, roomy and conveniently located.  Well equipped kitchen. Kids will enjoy a special place at the top of the stairs!  The neighborhood is very quiet with ample parking.  Owners address questions in a timely manner.  The parks nearby are a great place to take a walk."
32318245,600058181,2020-01-31,10337783,Chandra,"Perfect location near beautiful parks and hiking. The Kays are delightful and their place is spotless, tasteful decor and best of all comfy."
32318245,619241195,2020-03-16,115851398,Leilani,"Lillian was a great host! She responded quickly and was very helpful. Her place was beautiful, lots of thoughtful touches, clean and exactly as pictured. The third room was an upstairs loft/attic area that we didn't end up using, but the rest of the house was roomy and very comfortable. Lots of parking and nice outdoors area too. Would definitely stay again."
32318245,621070227,2020-03-27,293908848,Debra,Great place to stay. Comfortable living & dining space for the family to gather. Beautiful area of Salem.
32318245,622822924,2020-04-20,342832976,End,Nice place quiet..' cleaned and had everything I needed.. recommend this for any mom w kids...
32318245,625443564,2020-05-20,327222915,Daniel,"Lillian’s place is very peaceful and beautiful. I had a long stay and it was very accommodating. Good stay for work, beautiful touches all around the cottage, and a lot of space to park. They have everything you could need for a nice stay.  10/10 would recommend . Only complaint was for a long stay the old dining set that was there it broke and being so close to nature ants were also a small issue."
32318245,628954041,2020-06-11,342832976,End,Take pictures on arriving so you don't get charged four previous damages.. !
32318245,630606278,2020-06-19,348919261,Todd,Understand that you are close to nature so you will find ants and spiders and the likes.
32318245,632083056,2020-06-25,171151521,Robert,amazing.
32318245,634310658,2020-07-03,182696488,Crystal,"This is a great place to stay. It is tucked behind an office, so it is very secluded and private...zero road noise and you can see the trains as they go by! Read the description carefully, I thought this was a 2 bath, but it is really a 1.5 bath....so one shower."
32318245,635734134,2020-07-07,348607392,Denise,"The home had a lot of space and had everything we needed! Close to restaurants, grocery stores and parks. I would definitely book Lillian's home again if I am in the area!"
32318245,639135948,2020-07-17,296581725,Jim,"Great place to stay, Lillian and her husband were great hosts.  The place was clean and had everything we needed while we were there.  I will definitely stay here again on future trips if it's available."
32318245,708054392,2020-11-10,47598516,Suzanne,"Enjoyed this spacious cottage while visiting Salem.  This part of the country is beautiful.  Lillian had many special touches in place, you could tell energy was spent on decorating and making things just perfect for guests.  The unique floor plan allowed for separate space when we wanted it but also a large gathering room for the times our group was together just hanging out.  We enjoyed our time in Salem."
32318245,709174966,2020-11-15,141527048,Christian,Great place. Super clean and easy instructions. EXTREMELY quiet and private parking set back from the street. Loved the place and would stay there again.
32318245,712488210,2020-11-29,195309827,Angelica,"The house is bigger in person ! It was so roomy ,cozy & cute ! The couches are very comfortable 😌  loved that the master bedroom had its own sitting area complete with sectional . We stayed here over Thanksgiving break with our two kids and the house had everything we needed . Lilian offered some local tips for places to visit , silver falls was gorgeous ! We would definitely stay again if ever in the area ."
32318245,714580694,2020-12-10,111812456,Patti,"Quiet, spacious get away! We enjoyed our extended stay at Lillian's home. It was very quiet clean &  spacious with ample parking. It is very nicely decorated and has a well equipped kitchen with everything we needed for our 10 day stay. This was especially great since we cooked most meals with everything being closed d/t COVID. I would highly recommend Lillian's place."
32318245,715773211,2020-12-15,108393912,Kim,Great spot in Salem. Close to everything. Being next to the creek and field were perfect for the dog. Lilian was super responsive and went above and beyond to help us out! We will be back!!
32318245,731117962,2021-02-14,207364436,Josiah,Lovely place! our trip was short due to weather but still the time there was amazing.
32318245,741619079,2021-03-22,390024214,Jen,"I was pleasantly surprised at the space but was expecting an actual 3rd bed for sleeping arrangements. It was a blow up mattress but we made it work. Their wasn’t much that was missed in considering a stay, such as plenty of clean towels, toiletries and anything else you could need during a stay away from home. The only upset I had was the fact that the check out instructions weren’t understood clearly and unfortunately we got charged an extra cleaning fee and also we’re made to feel like my family were filthy people which we are not. I would recommend this place to someone else but sure to remind them about the check out instructions but we won’t be staying here again."
32318245,742433278,2021-03-26,28729987,Daniel,"Lillian’s Place is in a particularly convenient location, and very private and spacious— with well-lighted parking.  While there were only two of us, the space can easily hold a family.  The large kitchen and dining area make this a good short or longer-term stay."
32318245,743645370,2021-03-29,247863086,Brian,"The stay was overall very enjoyable and I would recommend the place. My favorite upgrade to the house was the door keypad for check-in. The negatives. . . there were ants that we messaged the host about. I'm sure they already knew because there were ant traps. They were confined to a small part of the kitchen. So, not a huge deal, but that was something we could have used a bit of warning about. Google had a bit of trouble finding the place. So we poked around for about 5-6 minutes trying to find the house. The back half acre was ""available,"" but a bit overgrown and stacked with cuttings from the ice storm. It would probably really nice after a mowing. There was a fire extinguisher, but my daughter found it only because she was being nosy in the cabinets near the back door. There were no tools for the fireplace, which made it precarious to manage the fire. Overall, it was a good place for the price, and a great location though."
32318245,744705609,2021-04-02,195782105,Anthony & Kathleen,"Lillian was a great host! The place was cute, cozy & quiet. My crew was very comfortable there & we'll definitely stay there again if we come back to Salem."
32318245,750413258,2021-04-19,370728286,Dana,Great communication from host. Good location. Clean and plenty of room.
32318245,754829643,2021-05-03,385490532,Isidro,"This location is two miles from downtown Salem, secluded and private.  The immediate area is a residential and quiet. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back."
32318245,757170677,2021-05-10,23949656,Vicky,Great little house - very private and comfortable
32318245,759966675,2021-05-18,385768251,Jalyn,"This cottage was great for our family. It was clean and centrally located for everything that we needed. The host, Lillian, was very accommodating for our needs. I would definitely recommend this property to anyone."
32318245,763859204,2021-05-29,97861881,Trevor,"Very accommodating! Perfect location, ESPECIALLY for the price! Plenty of amenities and a convenient check-in."
32318245,765727242,2021-06-02,377641308,Lori,"We enjoyed our stay. Quiet, lots of parking and home was really roomy."
32318245,767489727,2021-06-06,270411991,Samuel,This home is pretty cute inside! Much more spacious than I expected. Unfortunately our groups stay was less than satisfactory. <br/><br/>- No garbage bags in any garbage cans<br/>- Used shower items and lufa in the shower from other people<br/>- Washer & Dryer full of laundry<br/>- Master bedroom blanket had stains and hair<br/>- they request you clean your sheets and stuff when leaving instead of them cleaning it. Dryer had a full load of laundry from someone else was I supposed to fold their laundry? Host should always be the one taking care of cleaning and sanitizing blankets and sheets & dish ware for the next guest to ensure proper cleaning. I hope they can take some of this info and fix some things to ensure a better stay for the next guest. Also we did have a problem with the door not self locking so ask for the key to save you the hassle.
32318245,770124520,2021-06-13,394964696,Armentha,loved it being quite
32318245,386959280576837835,2021-06-17,55825051,Michael,Nicely decorated and spacious home.  Plenty of room for a family with all amenities one would need.  Very convenient to several golf courses and downtown areas.  We felt we got good value for cost of stay.
32318245,388443672763165617,2021-06-19,97127712,Craig,"Host is friendly and communicates well! We had no problem, but if there was one I’m sure it would have been handled quickly. Clean and modern environment. Spacious and unique in the layout. Just take note only one shower."
32318245,393488759588567210,2021-06-26,207454730,Cindy,"Spacious, quiet and private. The bed was very comfortable and the house was cool in spite of the heat thanks to the ductless AC in the main bedroom. The dog friendly space was very nice. The place could easily accommodate a larger group (this time it was only me and my two dogs). The location was perfect for all the activities I was in town for."
32318245,396355095278027344,2021-06-30,22735101,Jacob,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The cottage is very spacious, and in a great location. Internet speed was fast, and we were able to work remotely without any issue (there is also a treadmill desk which was awesome). Lilian provided prompt communication for any questions we had. I would definitely stay here again."
32318245,405050215704566330,2021-07-12,133659629,Carah,"Spacious house, tucked away, has everything you need."
32318245,407984521781277440,2021-07-16,76562130,Sandra,"I appreciate the communication , she did quickly . But there was spiders everywhere. Everyday when we woke up , there was spiders in tubs in sheets . <br/>The pillows being used , on couch and bed . Are not being cleaned per guest . Sticky pillows ."
32318245,410136046418716531,2021-07-19,198692429,Steve,"Beautiful home, well maintained with great accommodations.  Home was in a convenient location and worked perfectly for our trip to Salem.  We loved that we could bring our dog, he enjoyed the house too.  Couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay!"
32318245,415268337741072160,2021-07-26,36311752,Marcella,Comfortable and cozy and very quiet. Highly recommend
32318245,417435004893102820,2021-07-29,294401023,Gilbert,"What an absolutely amazing stay, we were taken away by the sheer size of the place and aesthetic. Wonderfully kept and surprisingly stocked with everything we needed."
32318245,420259418414058279,2021-08-02,257464111,Kelsey,Great place to stay in good location!

32318245,426817830923344173,2021-08-11,290616694,Sarah,We had a great stay! It was perfect for our family of 4 and 2 boxers. We had a small issue but Lillian was quick to respond and correct it. Really great and fast communication. Would definitely stay again my next time through. Thank You!
32318245,429712110130028850,2021-08-15,414160193,Rachel,"This was my first time using and Airbnb so wasn’t sure what to expect. This place is Super close to downtown Salem so anyone looking for that experience, this place is great. Try the Sassy Onion for lunch too 🤣 <br/>We went for a wedding so didn’t spend much time at the Airbnb. But it wasn’t quite what we expected...<br/>-old office building converted to a “residential” place so not easy to find.<br/>-if you stay over business days, expect traffic from the business in front of the “cottage”.<br/>-the stairs to the loft area are open from the back as well so NOT small kid friendly as they could fall trough the stairs. <br/>-the shower head is meant for someone 4’8”and under...my 6’3” husband had to literally shower on his knees 🤣 <br/>-no baking pans so if you plan on baking, bring your own pan. (I had Pillsbury cinnamon rolls)<br/>-no sugar in the house so if you want sweetener in your coffee or tea, bring your own. <br/>-the couch in the main family room is so worn out that you’ll fall into the cushions if you sit on the lounge part. <br/>- the second bed was actually a full size, not a queen.<br/><br/>All in all, this place might be great for a family of bigger kids but with babies, it was difficult. The back door deadbolt wouldn’t catch so my 2 year old was always escaping. It’s decorated cute but the class tables are not the best with little ones. My 1 year old kept trying to eat the fake pears. If I could have relaxed and not constantly worry about what the babies were into,  it might have been a different experience. But was cheaper than a hotel for my family of 6."
32318245,433333499011643329,2021-08-20,174662217,Erin,"Great location, spacious and well equipped cottage.<br/>Everything was clean, stocked, and Lillian was an extremely helpful host, will definitely be recommending this cottage to anyone we know visiting Salem!"
32318245,436293489713715881,2021-08-24,252432248,Nancy,"Great place to stay. Very clean, comfortable beds, great location, and lots of room!! Highly recommend!"
32318245,525466050463179522,2021-12-25,9151372,Stephanie,The pictures don’t do it justice. With the large couches I was afraid the house would be crowded but quite the opposite! So spacious - great when traveling with 2 small kids and they loved playing in the small loft upstairs. <br/><br/>It was so clean and such a unique layout. Magically close to downtown without being too close so we felt very safe. <br/><br/>Will absolutely be looking to book here on future visits 💕

32318245,605803659276495403,2022-04-15,63616033,Genevieve,"We stayed at Lillian's cottage during the last week of repairs on our home. It was truly a wonderful stay. The cottage has a unique layout that we really enjoyed and we appreciated how spacious it was for all of our baby gear. The king size bed was super comfortable. We also loved how quiet it was. Great location really close to everything. The cottage was incredibly clean and had everything we needed.<br/><br/>Lillian was a fantastic host. Her communication was super speedy and she was just great to work with. We certainly felt lucky to be her guests. Thank you, Lillian!"
32318245,612332113011209804,2022-04-24,366338898,Valentin,Amazing host!!! Really happy I found this property. Very cozy and warm home!
32318245,616714271071059958,2022-04-30,178681689,Chuck,"Great place for our quick trip to Salem. The home was bigger than we expected, with plenty of room for our family to stretch out and get ready for the wedding. The dogs were happy with the large lot nearby. It was perfect for us."
32318245,633450315447702437,2022-05-23,372259686,Unintentionally,"Overall a good stay. Came in with family for a wedding and had the place for a few days. Large open space with all the basics. I do however have a few complaints. First, would be the mattresses, (sping most likely) which should have been replaced some years back. They were extremely uncomfortable and sunken in from the center so you could only sleep on half of the bed comfortably. Small ant infestation so I hope the owners take a look into that soon. If you plan on staying here I would suggest you rewash towels and sheets before using them since it seems they leave the laundry wet sometime before they can get it into the dryer leaving an unpleasant odor on them."
32318245,638470765367285730,2022-05-30,349824375,Alice,"Nice quiet location, very clean, king bed was super comfy. Nice simple kitchen and a perfect place for dogs too. Thank you!"
32318245,647896972451747324,2022-06-12,383743092,Joselin,"I would highly recommend this airbnb for anyone staying in Salem. We were only there for about 3 days and the space was more than enough for 3 people. It was very clean and more than comfortable, I didn’t want to leave!! The home is located in an area that felt very safe. We had no problems finding the airbnb or checking in/out. Thanks Lillian!"
32318245,651523241998500655,2022-06-17,26269249,Brenda,"This was my first time and the whole process was easier then I thought. The communication was good, checking in went great, the stay was nice and checking out was easy. Thank you"

32318245,656579173322683355,2022-06-24,223836538,Cammee,"Beautiful home tucked behind a business allowing lots of privacy. Spacious layout that was perfect for family vacation! Although you can tell the home is older, you can also tell that it has been taken care of and loved. The living spaces are updated, clean, and pretty. Lilian was very quick to answer our questions and keep us updated with any changes. Our only dislike was being responsible for some of the cleaning at the end, not because we are lazy but because we’d feel more comfortable coming into a home knowing everything had been completed by a company and not the people who stayed in it before.  But we are slight germaphobes!!"
32318245,659466935664388031,2022-06-28,252432248,Nancy,"Super place to stay. Clean, convenient, and very comfortable."

Well equipped allowing us to eat our meals at home  or go out. <br/>The big grass area at the back of the parking lot was more overgrown than I had expected so we didn’t use it. <br/>Felt like home."

There was not one thing that we needed, that wasn’t already there, and then some.  Her response time, even after 12:30am was just about immediate.  Our stay at Connie’s made our reunion with family & graduation celebration all the more special.  Now looking for a reason to return.  Great memories for sure!!"

The yard is inviting and private.  Check in could not have been easier (which we appreciated greatly considering our late arrival time). We loved staying here and would definitely highly recommend."
32640764,678378091909913682,2022-07-24,455836252,Kevin,"For the most part had a very nice stay, the home was great, clean and met our needs. One incident early in the stay on some misinformation had the potential to derail this stay, but it was resolved quickly, and without further incident."
32640764,720412030206334574,2022-09-20,119505175,Zenzile,"An ideal place for our family trip to Salem. Comfortable, clean, spacious, tastefully decorated, and a responsive host too! I highly recommend Connie’s place!!"
32640764,729849055065710257,2022-10-03,64482046,Meghan,"Positive:  The house was very nice. It was clean and comfortable. There was plenty of space for our group of six and we didn’t feel cramped at all.  The upstairs loft/sleeping area was great for the kids to hang out in and watch what they wanted to on TV.  Although we didn’t use the backyard it looked nice and the furniture looked nice out there. It was located in a quiet neighborhood that wasn’t a far drive from downtown. <br/><br/>Negative: There were not a lot of extras out especially for a 6 day stay. Examples:  One bathroom didn’t have a hand towel and there were no extras. There were only two dish towel left and no dish cloth for wiping counters.  The fridge was quite small, for a six day stay with six people it was completely packed.  The water was turned off by the water company while we were there. The notice said it was due to unpaid bills, the host said it was a clerical error and that it would be taken care of.  The water did come back on a while later which was appreciated.  I was unaware of the clerical error and when I saw the notice that the water was off for an unpaid bill I was rightfully upset and let the host know. I demanded it be taken care of or she put us up in another accommodation.  She chastised me for being rude in my message and making demands. Again I didn’t know there was a clerical error and was concerned considering it was a Friday and I didn’t want to go with out water."
32640764,744306014943558572,2022-10-23,373158899,Pepe,"Very cozy home, comfortable beds, plenty of space. Well stocked. Fenced back yard. Private quiet neighborhood. Owners are quick to communicate."

32640764,837829953389273937,2023-03-01,58221333,Stacey,I am actually still at Connie's place just had to split the listing for insurance purposes. I am staying at Connie's long term due to an insurance claim. Connie has been very communicative and helpful my entire stay!
32640764,845069930932666824,2023-03-11,58221333,Stacey,"Great place to stay and great host. Very responsive and accommodating with whatever I needed. This was my first long time stay and her first long time guest and everything went great. I love that there are children's dishes and silverware available for the stay. I would definitely use this host or location again and recommend this for any family that needs a place to stay. Only thing to mention is that the listing does not say that pets are not allowed upstairs or on furniture so keep that in mind when booking. There is a small gate at the bottom of the stairs to keep pets down, but a larger dog can easily jump over that."
33344083,455598681,2019-05-19,7479132,Ron And Lana,"We had a lovely 3 night stay here!

It was super clean, quiet, and access was easy. I enjoyed chatting with them one night after I arrived, but if you want to come and go without talking you will have plenty of space. I will definitely come back here when I want some space from my fam :) Also, they have a Peloton bike and treadmill for all of you Pelo people!"

The room was clean, comfortable,  quiet, and private, and it met all my needs. The neighborhood is beautiful and feels very safe. WiFi Internet was fast and reliable, so I could get some work done in between visits with my elderly mother.<br/><br/>I had a busy schedule so didn't get a chance to take advantage of the living room, but it looked like a very nice space for planning one's day or relaxing at the end of the day.<br/><br/>I've stayed at many hotels and motels in Salem over the years, and Jeannette and Jim's place offers  a better combination of value,  location, and comfort than anything else I've found. I hope their room will be available next time I'm in Salem."

Her guest room is very nice and clean and the bed is comfortable. We were easily able to find her place and check in even though we arrived very late thanks to the information she sent us. We was kind to accommodate our very late check in. Jeanette has dogs who sometimes barked at us when we came and left each day but this didn't bother us, and they are contained behind a gate so they could not come downstairs to the guest room. We had a great stay and would definitely recommend Jeannette's place!"

33528630,502458512,2019-08-04,169200367,Megan,"Really loved our stay, super relaxing, convenient location. Loved the style and layout. Owner gave is some food tips for the area.

33528630,520018718,2019-08-29,260412355,Sean,Great experience. Way better than any hotel stay.
33528630,523054373,2019-09-02,26176137,Sarah,"Staying at Shana’s was like having a little home away from home. Everything was sparkling clean and very roomy. Even the shower had amazing water pressure! <br/><br/>If you’re traveling with two people and both like to read before bed, you may have to switch off each night for who has the bedside table with the lamp as there is only one proper nightstand  with a lamp. The other side has a lovely bench but no light so it’s a little dark to read from just the lamp light. However, there’s always the overhead lights you’d just have to get out of bed to turn them off."
33528630,524867198,2019-09-06,39363612,Marjorie,"We just loved Shana's Garage! Clean, stylish and we had everything we needed."

33528630,545149594,2019-10-11,5652264,Alex,"Shana's converted garage is a work of art! We were running extremely late for check-in and Shana made accommodations to make the process easy and pain free. I only wish we had even more time to enjoy the thoughtfully decorated space but we will definitely look her way again if we stay in Salem. If you're reading this and visit the area, definitely check out Word of Mouth Bistro - as the name might imply, it's worth it."
33528630,546603676,2019-10-13,66530438,Lynda,One of the nicer garage conversions I’ve ever seen! Super comfy space for our little family (plus infant and terrier). The heater got the place nice and toasty in minutes and breakfast and showering were easy in the morning.

33528630,555605700,2019-10-27,61326778,Brian & Genny,"Shana's place was great. It had everything my wife and I needed for a delightful weekend staycation. The place was clean, tidy, and stylish, and was great for relaxing and being a home base for us to explore downtown Salem from (it is within comfortable walking distance). I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a private space for a couple or small family. We will definitely look up Shana again on our next stay in Salem."

33528630,566838099,2019-11-20,229899316,Tiffiny,"Thanks to Shana for being a fantastic host.  The location was private and quiet, clean, and honestly just adorable.  I had everything I needed, and she was very responsive.   My schedule was a little erratic for when I'd be there and not be there, so the check-in and check-out was super convenient.  I definitely recommend this host and location!"

I highly recommend it as a place to stay if you need one in Salem. Not only is it a very stylish room but it has everything that you need.
33528630,574878824,2019-12-08,112761549,Jen,"Detached garage transitioned to a fantastic living space, very tastefully decorated with ALL the touches (even a little Christmas tree!! :) .

33528630,594149291,2020-01-17,27132432,Brian,Wonderful garage with all the space and nice touches you could ask for. One of the best Airbnb's I've stayed at.

33528630,600021859,2020-01-31,75979244,Jacey,"I had a lovely stay here. I had my own parking spot, access to Hulu and Netflix, the kitchen was large, and there were even snacks and breakfast foods. <br/><br/>The accommodation has all the comforts of home. The furnishings were clean, the host very kind, and the neighborhood laid back and quiet. <br/><br/>I would absolutely recommend this place, it is the perfect space for an Airbnb."

33528630,601835629,2020-02-04,11579167,Erin,"Shana's place, a renovated garage, is well-located near the Capitol and offers a good bed, a clean space, nice towels and a large and comfortable shower.  The toaster oven and coffee maker were nice and the Wifi was solid. Bring slippers since the floor is poured concrete and pretty cold.<br/><br/>The host could work on communication with guests, the dog run aromas and heat level.  In what I hope was a fluke, she called law enforcement when she saw (registered guest) in the backyard waiting for the key or further instructions, without calling me to confirm identity first. Police came out and asked for ID and proof of invitation. This was distressing and really put a shadow on the whole experience after a long day of work and travel. Shana and Airbnb are working on it, and I trust this won't happen to people in the future."
33528630,602422609,2020-02-06,185970366,Dewey,great place  to get a nice quiet rest while in salem..

33528630,621368128,2020-03-30,51071355,Megan,"Shana's converted garage space was just as advertised - thoughtfully appointed, spotlessly clean (and I could tell she'd taken extra measures to ensure everything was sanitized). She was prompt in her communications, flexible about my need to reschedule and overall a pleasure to deal with. My kitty and I LOVED our stay!  Highly recommended."

33528630,627490616,2020-06-02,119813753,Emily,The pictures don't do this cute little place justice. We stayed with our 13 month old and dog and it was very quiet and cozy for us. Shana let us check in a little early which I greatly appreciated! Thank you so much for a great stay!

The atmosphere is calm and refreshing. The location is great.  The side patio was a bonus we weren't expecting and it was so nice to sit out in the morning and enjoy our coffee.

We reached out to Shana beforehand about COVID precautions and needed to bring our dog with us last minute. She was quick to reply, helpful, and friendly. <br/><br/>The Garage itself is a super cute refurbished garage with everything you need for a long weekend. We found the bed very comfortable. Night time was quite and peaceful which is important to us as we have a vocal dog when something goes bump in the night. <br/><br/>Great neighborhood with easy access to anything you need. Highly recommend staying here and would certainly make a booking if it’s available next time we’re in town."

Shana updated me about the power outages in Salem due to the ice storm. She even offered to refund my fee if I decided to stay elsewhere, if the power does not get back on time. The power came back on time but I really appreciated Shana’s honesty and concern for her guest. The space was super clean and has a nice modern look. I highly recommend this place and I do not think there is any other place for this price close to the downtown Salem."

I had no problems connecting online. It was hot outside (in the 80s) -There is an air conditioner but I didn’t really need it as the garage stayed pretty cool on its own-very comfortable!  Little additions such as soft sheets and soft towels made this a very comfortable stay. The place is spacious and the extra large shower is one of the best features!

Just so comfortable, the host is very responsive, anything you could need is available and clearly explained. It's also very private which was great. I especially liked the outdoor seating which was comfortable. The mattress was so supportive that I wasn't aching from my long flight because of it. My flight landed so late that I didn't arrive until about two AM, but she was able to sort out a solution with me ahead of time. I would take this place over a hotel every time."

33528630,773346505590507991,2022-12-02,66884908,Courtney,"Absolutely loved the “garage”. Such a comfortable space. <br/><br/>I would recommend if you are prone to cold feet like I am and stay during the winter time, the floor is concrete which naturally is cold. Otherwise the space itself is nice and warm. My little piggies are just ice all the time anyways. Nothing that the place itself did to them. Lol"

The “garage” is truly lovely, spacious and well laid-out, and the neighborhood is very quiet. You have your own offstreet parking space, three steps from the private entry into this fully detached garage which has been thoughtfully renovated.  I spent a wonderful week here in January, and stayed toasty warm. Genuinely comfortable bed and pillows. The owner provides shampoo and conditioner, soap, and a bounty of towels.  She is quick to communicate, respectful of privacy, and a nice person.  Great value, great place!"

33528630,815332509200295917,2023-01-29,190610179,Charmaine,"We loved our stay at the Garage! It was a perfect location for our weekend activities, and we felt right at home. Shana was friendly and communicative. Our 13-year-old daughter slept quite comfortably on the floor mattress, and we did as well on the main bed.  As someone else had mentioned, you may want to bring slippers or cozy socks as the concrete floor not covered with rugs is COLD! The bathroom sink took a little while to get hot water, but the weather was chilly. Ample blankets, towels, and washcloths and nice extras of some snacks, tea and coffee. We wish we could have stayed longer in this cozy little place and plan to book it the next time plans take us to Salem."

It is close to the supermarket, downtown Salem is a few minutes by car and its centrally located for any trips to the coast, the mountains, the waterfalls or a day in Portland. We loved this cottage and hated to leave."

The Little Blue House was also very convenient to the location of the family event we traveled to Salem for."
33901803,768706542,2021-06-10,117187697,Calen,"A lovely spot where we hope to stay again. Norma and her husband have remodeled and decorated it themselves and it retains a quirky vintage feel and decor. We were so comfortable and didn’t lack for anything thanks to the many thoughtful touches. It was extremely quiet for the location—the only noise we heard was the neighbors’ car, which is surprising given how central it is. Norma was an excellent host, even arranging to let me pick up some items I left accidentally a couple of days later."

33901803,490629945011182868,2021-11-07,84553153,Ray And Stella,Everything was superb.  Even had fun searching thru the lockers to see what treasures they held.  Bring house slippers if you have sensitive feet or else you will track in alot of leaves if you don't leave your street shoes by the door.  (we stayed during the leaf drop season).  The decor was interesting and cute.  Lots of items for the visitor - we found out about and visited the Vinn Distillery thru the info magazines left for us to look at.  We would have never found out about if we hadn't looked!
33901803,494995518952958726,2021-11-13,4052096,Patricia,"The little blue house was a perfect place to explore Salem from. It is tucked away on a private street, but is close to everything.

After a long day of house hunting it was nice to come back to the cottage and have a glass of local Pinot noir in the cozy living room."

The host followed up to make sure we were in and settle and asked if we had any questions, a great touch. The home was easy to locate and being a small Court, gave us a sense of privacy.  My wife is a light sleeper so we notice how quiet or loud a place is and the home as very quiet to relax and sleep.<br/><br/>The home is in a great location with grocery and health food shopping within 10 minutes and easy to navigate.<br/>Everything in the home worked perfectly. The photos and description are consistent with what we  experienced during our stay. We had one question about the entertainment system and the host answered quickly and resolved it without an issue.  The weekend was great thanks to being in a  such a nice home and interacting with great hosts.<br/><br/>We are going to be back in Salem later this year and hope to be able to stay if the place is available."

34158635,521304344,2019-08-31,75822800,Rebeca,"Evelyn is a great hostess. She is kind and respectful to her guests. She responds quickly to needs you may have as a gust and will give you space and privacy for you to feel comfortable at her house. <br/>I stayed the month of August in her house and felt cold in the basement room where I stayed, but she provided an electric heater for me. Evelyn is accesible and caring. You will enjoy staying at her place."
34158635,539112926,2019-09-30,8367187,Patricia,"Evelyn is an excellent host. The room almost feels like a separate apartment with a separate sitting room, makeshift kitchen and dining area, and huge bedroom with 2 chairs and table. Also, a nice patio in her great garden backyard. It’s cleaned once a week and very comfortable. Plus, Evelyn brings in fresh flowers from her garden often."

34158635,621938954,2020-04-06,8367187,Patricia,"I’ve stayed at many AIRBNB‘s around the world but never found one as comfortable and accommodating as Evelyn‘s place. It’s almost like having your own apartment. The bed was comfortable, there’s a sitting area,  almost separate kitchen area, and she thought of all the special touches like fresh flowers every few days, warm fresh baked cookies, and pleasant conversations."
34158635,633856908,2020-07-01,297749870,Joey,"Place was great, and the host's are very welcoming and respecting of space. I would recommend this place to anyone."

34158635,657965439,2020-08-29,27236262,Thibaud,"Evelyn was very welcoming even though I arrived a bit later than expected. I have never seen such a clean room (very clean towels also) and felt very safe about covid. The bed sheets are so comfortable and soft ! I definitely recommend, thank you!"

34158635,396416262263295031,2021-06-30,253719643,Wenzel,"I was working a six-month contract and I stayed with Evelyn for the entire time. I had never stayed at an Airbnb for longer than a few days at a time, so I didn't know what to expect. Evelyn, however, could not have been a more perfect host! She keeps her house extremely clean, the accommodations were exactly what I needed, Evelyn was very helpful and accommodating for my work needs since I had to work remotely the entire time, and the location of the house is perfect to access places to eat, groceries, and my gym. Evelyn takes great pride (and rightly so!) in her backyard, which is absolutely beautiful. I never took advantage of sitting outside on the patio and I regret it. I could not recommend staying with Evelyn highly enough."
34158635,403593540747752538,2021-07-10,118832002,Beth,"Great AirBNB! Lots of space, privacy, and very well stocked. Evelyn is very kind, pleasant to talk with, and keeps a beautiful garden. She and Aram were quick to help with anything needed. The bed is super comfortable too. Thanks!"

Spotlessly clean with beautiful sunken gardens outside the window. I stayed at her place when I was visiting my son who lived nearby.
34158635,469621414601712321,2021-10-09,268587552,Vic,One of the best AirBNB's to stay to. Ms. Evelyn was so generous to share some of her food and fruits. She also allowed me to keep my luggages until my other apartment was ready. It is a great location too since it is close to downtown!
34158635,572494137928125302,2022-02-28,440955541,Ibzan,"Ms Evelyn is a perfect host! Thank you for your accommodation!<br/>I appreciate the location because it is just 4 min drive from Salem Hospital. I work nights and the place was suitable for me as it is quiet. The house also offers clean, clear, distilled water👌🏼👍"
34158635,662415248151702277,2022-07-02,379308472,Marnie,"I was fortunate to have stayed at Evelyn’s for several months while on work contracts at the local hospital. I was there for the transition into spring, so got to see all of her beautiful flowers bloom. Her yard should be showcased in Better Homes and Gardens if it hasn’t been already. Very convenient location, close to the hospital, and on sunny days, I enjoyed walking to work through Bush Pasture Park, which is also full of lovely blooms. Home is right down the street from Daynight Donuts, which has tons of donut varieties, and Umpqua ice cream, as well. Lots of restaurants nearby on S. Commercial St., too. The basement level of the home is shared with another long-term guest. He usually arrives later in the evening, but isn’t there every night. Evelyn recently had a new washer, dryer, and sink installed for the basement level. Everything you need for your stay can be accessed in the basement: large fridge, hot plate, small toaster oven, Keurig, ample shelving for non-perishables, etc.. The room itself is large as described, again with ample drawers and space to store things. The TV in the room has lots of Dish channels. Comfortable bed and blankets. Good A/C. Convenient off-street parking right up the driveway. No safety issues, and there are cameras on the property. Good neighborhood for walking, and the high school track is right across the street. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here; definitely book if you have the opportunity to stay, too."
34158635,668909996217921265,2022-07-11,151384644,Joshua,Great place at a reasonable price. Host has thought of everything for your stay.

The room was very spacious and the garden was beautiful! I was working night shift and had to check out right before my last night shift and she let me do a much later check out. I’m bummed I found her listing at the end of my contract or else I’d be trying to stay there everytime! Thanks again Evelyn!

Krista allowed us to stay with the third person without changing more. Too bad that we could stay only for one day. The neighborhood is nice and quiet and the charge is quite reasonable.

Only drawback was that we could hear people walking (and small children running) on the floor above us. Being a basement unit it is understandable and did not go on to late into the evening.  All in all beautiful place.

36353518,814562947806453544,2023-01-28,79371253,Andrew,"The apartment is well equipped with everything you need and more. Wi-Fi worked great and tv was great. It was nice to have an off street parking spot. Half of the pillows in the bed are hard and half are soft. We preferred the soft ones. The hard ones were too hard. The bed was very comfortable. The room was very clean except for one cob web that was hanging from the ceiling. It was not a big deal to us though. I did not like that they had a Bible in the room. Hosts need to be aware that not everyone has their religion, this should be left out of the room."

I would definitely stay here again!"

Perfect for our quick, one night stopover.. we didn’t get in until like 3am- and there was no issue there. Very accommodating host! Jada left us yummy (and healthy, too!) snacks, and there were little sleep melatonin gummies and soap samples and cough drops.. it was proper!"

36806045,500808403,2019-08-02,186780702,Tina,Kathie was so welcoming and made us feel so comfortable. She was very quick to respond with any questions we had. The house was decorated beautifully and the atmosphere was very relaxing. I loved the outside area with lights for us to hang out and enjoy each other's company. Very beautiful home.

The location was convenient for visiting downtown and had quick access I-5.  Kathie responded quickly to all my questions and the kitchen was well equipped for family meals together. Hope we can visit again soon.

36806045,575352192,2019-12-09,224175432,Mylinh,"Very clean and comfortable.   There were beautiful wood floors, a warm fireplace, and lots of space.  The shower felt great and the bed linens were very nice.   The Christmas tree, simply lit with white lights, was such a charming seasonal touch.  The check in was very easy.  The road that the property is located on is quite busy with traffic.  We stayed in the back room and it quieted down significantly at night and we slept with no disturbance.  This was a great choice for our stay and I would have enjoyed to have been there another night."
36806045,580573613,2019-12-22,2231931,Chris,This cozy house is nicely styled with comfortable beds and a nice kitchen with washer/dryer.  There were even some toys for our grandkids who came to stay with us a couple of nights.  The street outside was busy but quieted down at night.  The location was great for us.
36806045,582830778,2019-12-27,13274352,Lauren,"We were so impressed with the beautiful renovation of this Salem home. Kathie took care to modernize and put in high-end appliances. The house was spotless, and the beds were very comfortable. Kathie was responsive to all of our needs, and her dog Hilo was super cute and friendly. We had a wonderful stay. The house is on Market Street which is a busy thoroughfare, so if you are sensitive to sound, you might want to bring ear plugs. Getting in and out of the driveway wasn't as bad as we thought it would be."
36806045,586419794,2020-01-01,313478005,Tim,Kathie's place is a charming home in the heart of Salem.  It's clean and bright with a delightful ocean theme.  You will thoroughly enjoy your stay!

36806045,602106792,2020-02-05,78025001,Cami,"Wow wow wow! This place is beautiful, peaceful, and the most comfortable beds I have slept in at an Airbnb!

The Bed was Huge & the most comfortable bed we have slept in anywhere on the road! We love to walk and my wife had the best 4 mile daily walk with beautiful lil houses & landscaping!! We were in Salem to visit our Granddaughter who is a Softball player & Pre- Med Student.  We were 5 minutes to Willamette U & Downtown Salem. Close to the 5 and many restaurants! Kathy was so accommodating for everything we needed! She is a Wonderful Lady & made our Stay amazing!! We will be back Next year!! So informative explaining all the Sights to visit!! Thank you Kathie!
36806045,614344906,2020-03-04,192598914,Brandon,Place was nice but the owner lives downstairs and was making a lot of noise until late at night.

36806045,620119212,2020-03-20,134006225,Carolann,"We were so grateful for Kathie’s space! We had a sudden change of plans and ended up needing a place to stay last minute. Kathie responded to us immediately and even told us we could check in at any time we needed!<br/>Her home was clean, accommodating, and relaxing. We enjoyed time on the private patio, had a full kitchen to make dinner, and relaxed for the evening.<br/>Kathie, thank you so much for sharing your space with us!"

36806045,692841427205584387,2022-08-13,369842502,Hanna,"This home was nice and messaging with Kathie was pleasant. But, there was no lock to the basement where she lives, and it made us feel uncomfortable to know that she could come up into the Airbnb at anytime, there felt a lack of personal security with that. She also had a dog that was barking and you could hear it plainly. The dog barked continuously outside at 2am which kept us up."
36806045,718237399754156953,2022-09-17,472426094,Bernard,Nice charming place to stay.

Hands down, the best equipped kitchen that I’ve ever had through Airbnb. Kathie was a great host too, making herself available to us as needed and friendly. We really appreciate her and her great home."
36806045,753676960967334003,2022-11-05,176131040,Alicia,"I loved how clean the house was ! Money worth spent, will definitely book again in the future !"

36806045,780525088606138895,2022-12-12,13283467,Larissa,We appreciated Kathie’s lovely home! Traveling with kids can always be so complicated but we had a lot of room for our family of four. She had a travel crib available which was nice to have one less thing to pack and she had a few toys that even our 6 year old and 2 year old could both play with.<br/><br/>She had even decorated for Christmas which was so cozy and a nice touch!
36806045,786307817249095953,2022-12-20,272771836,Mary,Kathie is a great host & her place is charming! Very comfy bed & we had everything we needed. She has thought of everything!

36806045,800124534034527560,2023-01-08,345550781,Iris,The house was very lovely. It was decorated nicely but no clutter.<br/>Kitchen was stocked  and  beds were comfortable.
36806045,801570483748336025,2023-01-10,8815032,Megan,"I was a bit disappointed.<br/>Cleaning fee was as much as the stay<br/>($100) and we still had to take the trash out. On two different occasions ants were roaming in the home.<br/>The owner lives underneath and could hear upset children cry during the night.<br/>Also located near a busy street, lots of outside noise. <br/><br/>Was not a very restful night :("
36806045,805211328788471936,2023-01-15,96427639,Sarah,"Great host, very very clean home. Super spacious TONS OF BEDDING/pillows. 10/10"
36806045,809488912547320741,2023-01-21,257008396,Kathy,Great stay! Super clean and comfy beds.
36806045,814651233799336688,2023-01-28,6705774,Melinda,We enjoyed our stay at Kathie's place very much. After a long day it was so nice to come to a clean and cozy home to settle in for the night. great location and would love to come again .
36806045,818971889078726166,2023-02-03,31923534,Jerid,"The place is lovely, and very well appointed. It's a nice space. The bathroom is a little narrow but not unusable, and it's very comfortable. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the large king-sized bed had hair on the sheets, and... ants. There were at least 3 dozen little sugar ants that were on and in the bed. I looked for fresh sheets but could not find them, and it was too late to move to a new location or do anything about it.<br/><br/>I looked back later and noticed that a review from the month prior mentioned the same things. Without the ants, I would rate this property as a 4.5... many fine things about it, good value, comfy. And getting ants in the Pacific NW in the winter is not unusual. But unsurprisingly, it changed the experience for me quite a bit. I could not recommend this property until the pests are confirmed to be dealt with."
36806045,820389845400049495,2023-02-05,457847347,Chela,"Comfortable, cute and well maintained.  My family felt at home. Kathie was so friendly and flexible. We truly appreciate her. We will be staying again when visiting Salem."

36806045,835664850369032909,2023-02-26,99778480,Scott,This is a very cool house!  Lots of supplies.  We had 6 of us staying there and we were comfortable.  The bathroom is a bit small but very functionable.  <br/>The location is great and easy to find but the driveway is small and only fits one vehicle.  Backing out of the driveway can pucker you up as the road is busy.  Overall we would stay there again!
36806045,839995226104205881,2023-03-04,12293847,Robert,"Kathie’s place is clean, comfortable and well appointed.

36806045,850835695699664873,2023-03-19,67096411,Junior,A good spot for downtime. Will come back again.
37157862,497787639,2019-07-28,70833648,Jean,Perfect place to be. Relaxing sound of the water and wonderfully clean and neat. We had a wifi hotspot on our telephone and we set up the TV. You will love this place. There was plenty of room for our family of five. Three adults and 2 children. We all love the stream running directly behind the condo.
37157862,498485089,2019-07-29,64844342,Hayley,Amanda was really accommodating for a last minute booking — the apartment was really nice and spacious with convenient parking outside. And the creek view from the balcony is so cool!
37157862,499032445,2019-07-30,13965270,Jim,Great value and comfort! Amanda did a super job communicating and all went well. Would definitely rent again.
37157862,500196853,2019-08-01,155291971,Dick And Suzanne,Great value‼️My  favorite place at apartment was the balcony over looking the stream with all the lush foliage and trees
37157862,502584131,2019-08-04,53968031,David,"Nice space, with a great deck overlooking the creek.<br/>Very convenient to downtown"
37157862,505782791,2019-08-09,60276082,Christine,"The sound of the running creek is a peaceful from the deck of this condo. The host was very friendly and responded quickly to my emails. She made sure I had ample parking close by. The condo was neat ,  tidy and had everything I needed for a short stay. Beds were very comfy and the  linens were high quality. Downtown Salem is within walking distance."
37157862,507644723,2019-08-11,3629152,Wilma,Sparkling clean
37157862,510159727,2019-08-15,222089778,Candace,"I loved everything about this place, would recommend!"
37157862,517786162,2019-08-25,128866577,Kathryn,"Just a block from downtown, great location to wander and close enough to Salem’s farmers market too! Dog friendly! Foggy loved it. The place itself was super clean and nice. Shampoo, conditioner and body wash provided which is always helpful. AC unit in the bedroom. Creek off the patio, it was nice opening the slider door and listening to it. Since this is close to downtown, once it gets dark there are homeless people but they stuck to themselves and didn’t bother us while we walked our dog. I’d definitely stay again! :)"
37157862,518982352,2019-08-27,121478663,Honey Jean,"It’s a great spot, a great place :-) rather large apartment with a beautiful creek running behind it. Could one ask for more!?"
37157862,520029634,2019-08-29,283448250,Pamela,"Accommodations were comfortable, clean, and close to amenities.  Loved the creek!  We had breakfast each morning out on the balcony.  I had forgotten to pack a couple items and was pleasantly surprised that the condo had them.  Every question asked was promptly answered.  This was our first Airbnb experience and for future travel I will look first to them for accommodations."
37157862,522992724,2019-09-02,139224766,Randy,"This place was incredibly clean and so close to stores and bars! The three other people in my group particularly enjoyed The Coin Jam, a bar with arcade games in the back that was minutes from the property.<br/><br/>Parking is great, there is ample space for food and belongings and the bathroom was spacious for even the four of us to get ready. <br/><br/>The host was great in the little time we needed her as the vast majority of the time it went flawlessly. The one small issue we had was resolved with open communication and great respect. She really has earned her superhost rating!<br/><br/>We greatly recommend this property for the type of group we had (two couples) and of course would stay again if given the opportunity! Our only regret is not staying longer!"
37157862,524835956,2019-09-06,190205699,Logan,Such a beautiful cozy place. Felt like home from the second you walk in. Very clean and has everything you will need while your there. The hosts are very nice and they are very good about being available to answer any questions or concerns you might have. Loved it and would defiantly stay again. Best Airbnb I’ve ever been in😊
37157862,526987888,2019-09-09,29060277,Kyle,Nice two bedroom right on the creek.<br/>The area is kind of loud with interesting conversations and hang outs on the bridge next to the place.<br/>Shades in the bedrooms don't block light very well and the windows do allow a good amount of outside noise in.<br/>Large parking spot almost right outside the door.<br/>Roomy place.
37157862,528253720,2019-09-12,253530699,Jennie,"Nice place to stay. I love the brook right off the deck. The carpet must have been recently washed though, the house had a musty smell."
37157862,528808015,2019-09-13,25376812,Debra,"This place was absolutely delightful! Loved the babbling creek outside, the spaciousness of the space, how clean it was!! And for me, a Willamette parent who had to make a last minute/emergency trip up to Salem, it was PERFECT! I needed more nights which they sadly, did not have - (next place wasn’t nearly as perfect)!! I am already planning my next stay there."
37157862,530435438,2019-09-15,51276711,Trish,We absolutely loved the sound of the river!! The location made it possible to walk to anywhere downtown. The place was very clean!
37157862,531012896,2019-09-16,178721839,Meg,This was a cute place for a nights stay in Salem as we were passing by.
37157862,535980559,2019-09-25,289925070,David,It’s a easy to find Airbnb with everything you need for a short stay. Perfect situated in Salem.
37157862,540544062,2019-10-03,27621462,Lauren,"First off, this place was super clean, which I appreciate more than anything. Unfortunately, the space was sparsely furnished with no nightstands in one bedroom and no end tables or coffee table to set drinks on in the living room. I spent quite a bit of time in the home during our stay, and it was not conducive to actually living in the space. I had to pull a chair over to set a drink on by the couch, and I had nowhere to set my phone or a water while I slept besides the floor. There are no curtains in the bedrooms, so the light from outside came in through the blinds, which made it hard to sleep, even if I could have slept with all the yelling and screaming outside throughout the night. I don’t know where it was coming from, but I had to keep white noise playing to even get a little sleep. I was in town for a conference and ended up so exhausted during the day from lack of sleep to be able to focus. I really wish I could have left a better review because it was so clean and the location was close to downtown, but three days later I’m still exhausted and annoyed at the experience I had. Only stay here if you plan to drink or medicate yourself sleep."
37157862,541747495,2019-10-05,162016354,Jillian,This cute condo is in a location close to downtown Salem. There was lots of space and the ambient noise from the Mill Creek was relaxing. Amanda was always quick to respond and answer our questions during booking. Thanks!
37157862,544644009,2019-10-10,162570367,Liz,"Great location and wonderful space! Enjoyed our stay at the condo and loved the sound of the creek next to it! Highly recommend and would absolutely return, very clean as well, it was perfect!"
37157862,546670667,2019-10-13,40234737,Sherry,"Amanda’s place was perfect for us. We were two Mom’s visiting our college sons. The kitchen was well stocked with utensils, pans & dishes allowing us to make a home cooked meal for the boys. The location next to the stream was peaceful & beautiful. I’ll be staying at Amanda’s place again!"
37157862,554631268,2019-10-26,127884366,Steve,We stayed one night and it fit the bill.  Thanks!
37157862,556529214,2019-10-29,232327,Brandi,"Stayed in Salem for several days at Amanda's place! I was very pleased with host communication and hospitality, easy check in and the place had lots of extra perks that were great! Lots of extra blankets, and towels and the beds were very comfortable. The running creek behind the unit was relaxing and peaceful. Travel to Salem often and will be more than glad to return.<br/>Amanda was easy and fast with communication and very helpful with all my requests!<br/>Great Job to an Excellent Host"
37157862,557751266,2019-11-01,305757585,David,Great place to stay if you are in the Salem area. Very accommodating and great hospitality and not to mention super clean. The sound of the creek was amazing. 10/10 would recommend.
37157862,559196570,2019-11-03,167945671,Jennifer,"Cute condo alongside a creek which adds to the character and charm of the place. Super clean, neighborhood was fine, and close to downtown. Working with Amanda was so easy, she accurately described everything we needed to know. Highly recommend staying at this location."
37157862,560728140,2019-11-07,303777801,Capella,"What a fantastic place,  my daughter wants to live there forever.  The view is gorgeous with fall colored broad leaf maples over the creek. I enjoyed listening to the burble of the creek as I slept. The kitchen has all the tools I needed for cooking meals. It was perfect."
37157862,561563094,2019-11-09,13650996,Alan,Just as shown and clean.  Nice to be able to hear the creek running at night.  We enjoyed our night there.

37157862,572026836,2019-12-01,14211849,Jim,Great stay!  Very clean place!  We enjoyed hearing the sound of the river flowing while we slept.  The coffee was delicious and the beds were comfortable.

37157862,574766656,2019-12-08,5165657,Nicole,"This is a lovely space, very close to campus and everything central to Salem. It’s very nice to hear the creek outside the bedroom window. It’s a cozy, clean and warm space. It was perfect for my visit with my son, who attends Willamette.   I really enjoyed my time there. The parking space right next to apartment was also so convenient. Communication was excellent with hosts. I would stay here again."
37157862,578753555,2019-12-18,68902419,Margie,"Amanda & her team are amazing! This is the second place of Amanda’s that I’ve stayed & she does not disappoint. It was very comfortable, cozy yet spacious & perfect location for us. It was close to work, our favorite yoga studio & downtown. There is also a laundry facility on site - very convenient. We will definitely be back!"
37157862,579878298,2019-12-21,134807639,Brenda,Place is very clean and convenient if you need to be downtown Salem area.
37157862,580521429,2019-12-22,258112699,Benjamin,Great communication and super friendly to talk to. Offered to return a beloved Pooh bear that got left behind. Very thoughtful. Great place. Super clean and comfy beds. Super convenient for our short stay. Thx so much!!

37157862,594093579,2020-01-17,315289164,Kathy,"This Airbnb was spacious and clean and in a great location (quiet residential area but close to downtown). The ""creek view"" is more of a rushing river that was really close to the condo.  I loved the sound of the water at night. Enjoy!"
37157862,595225372,2020-01-19,117798861,Mireya,"Great location, very spacious condo. The stream is just outside the large deck ."
37157862,595712974,2020-01-20,52317293,Jillian,Super cute and very clean! The creek is beautiful and I enjoyed falling asleep to the sound. <br/><br/>Accessibility to our vehicle and to surrounding businesses was a breeze. <br/>Would definitely stay here again.
37157862,596158925,2020-01-21,326560963,Markus,"Great place, quiet and private. The creek outside created wonderful ambiance."
37157862,596748141,2020-01-23,28345669,Chris,Amanda's condo was very homey. We had close access to all of Salem and we loved all the extra towels and bedding. Amanda was very responsive throughout the stay.
37157862,597509343,2020-01-25,296422508,Jasmin,Had a great stay everything looked very modern and up to date it was a lovely condo and I’ll stay again in the future ☺️
37157862,598301364,2020-01-26,174456224,Carl,This place is fantastic! Thank you.
37157862,600442978,2020-02-01,60598930,Jennifer,Excellent location and apartment. The creek is right off the patio. Within walking distance to tons of restaurants and shopping.
37157862,602119802,2020-02-05,63521186,Gloria,"Very nice, cozy and clean space to get a nice weekend off from the bug city! We loved it!"
37157862,602434356,2020-02-06,11295763,Bethany,"Great location near the Capitol, walking distance to Downtown amenities."
37157862,603933162,2020-02-09,40234737,Sherry,Amanda’s place is always clean & comfortable. Great location near downtown Salem.
37157862,607431146,2020-02-17,279940099,Ben,"Amanda's condo was spotless and had room for 5-6 people (if you use the living room sleeper sofa).  We could hear the creek in the master bedroom.  Lots of space in the living room, kitchen was well stocked and efficient to use; we used it for breakfast and dinner.   Our kids loved the supply of board and card games, plus snuggling in front of the TV.  WiFi worked perfectly.  The condo is close to the capitol and the river front park - just a few minutes drive to either; probably could have walked to the river.  I can see why it's a popular location to book."
37157862,608142971,2020-02-19,122998374,Timothy,"Amazing location and very spacious and comfortable. The balcony overlooks a flowing stream, and is so relaxing. Walking distance to downtown Salem."
37157862,608477784,2020-02-20,22266352,Meredith,"The view of the river was gorgeous.  The apartment is perfect for a short trip where you want to be comfortable and have easy access to downtown Salem, but maybe don't want to do your own cooking (limited kitchen amenities).  Overall we had a nice, quiet stay and Amanda was a pleasure to work with."
37157862,609295504,2020-02-22,88149863,Stacy,"Amanda’s apartment is great! All you need, coffee, sugar, Splenda, toiletries. The best part is that you can hear the Creek from the  bedroom and living room. Also, it’s in walking distance of downtown in a sweet neighborhood.  Highly recommend."
37157862,611709352,2020-02-27,35193957,Linda,"Amanda's place was warm, convenient for downtown (not a pleasant walk into town though) and the beds were comfortable. It is quite dated though with a heavily stained living room carpet, shower doors that don't slide easily and quite dark. We did enjoy the sound from the creek running in front of the condo but not of the upstairs resident opening and closing his sliding doors every evening! The living room is sparsely furnished and there was only one bedside table in our room, would be helpful to have on one each side. Brenda was friendly in communication and was very responsive when we thought someone was in our parking space (they weren't). <br/>We wouldn't stay here again, would opt for somewhere brighter and more modern. <br/>It is good value though and the hosts seem like nice people."
37157862,618869816,2020-03-15,336755791,Alex,Great place in my opinion
37157862,627083393,2020-05-31,116530036,Audrey,"Very comfortable and relaxing! The creek outside is super nice and refreshing, and the place was perfect! Great location, too. We really enjoyed our stay here."
37157862,631292799,2020-06-21,111437356,Kaira,"Awesome decor, incredibly accomodating, perfect location, and the creek running through the back yard area is absolutely breathtaking. I will definitely be coming back."
37157862,631557474,2020-06-22,5079733,Eula,"This place is a a dream, the rooms are large, the beds are cozy and the bathroom is spotless. I couldn’t have asked for anything more 💞"
37157862,632361932,2020-06-26,13647228,Robert,Lovely space close to the Capitol. It is NE Salem so it is not the nicest area of the city but the Creek right next to the place is amazing and makes up for that.
37157862,633166031,2020-06-28,229155275,Martin,Place was in a great location for the capital of Oregon. Definitely recommend for a small family or couple.
37157862,633679876,2020-06-30,209766773,Vickie,We enjoyed our stay here it met our needs and had a great location we also loved that we were able to park right next to our condo when I travel alone sometimes it’s hard to get my luggage upstairs in through elevators but this was simple and easy.<br/>But first and foremost I felt SAFE it’s been hard for me to find an affordable place in Salem that I wasn’t concerned for my safety.<br/>This place is a great value
37157862,635206935,2020-07-05,171519153,Matt,Very Spacious!  The creek out back was very relaxing to listen to as we were sitting on the deck!
37157862,636582707,2020-07-10,58121348,Robin,Beautiful  look for the doors with keyless entry  and you will be fine
37157862,640195486,2020-07-19,352553660,Jolynn,nice place !!
37157862,641898309,2020-07-24,296349110,Bonnie,"We loved staying in this space! The glass doors and everything else were very clean, there were plenty of extra linens and towels. We stayed nice and cool with the ac/fan setup. The balcony and creek were great as well, we enjoyed game night with the family on the deck. Overall it was a great escape!"
37157862,643713269,2020-07-28,163736219,Zac,Great location. Nice amenities.
37157862,646394763,2020-08-03,79553059,Shirley,"A very relaxing home with deck overlooking a creek, excellent beds and well-appointed kitchen and bathroom."
37157862,649172177,2020-08-09,356607797,Carrie,Very clean just as described. Walked to breakfast in morning. Would stay here again.
37157862,649592951,2020-08-10,89407182,Jennifer,Nicely redone in side and has linen and towels.  Does have a terrible smoke smell at the entry/kitchen possibly from the noisy tenants above. The bathroom and the kitchen have not been redone. Kind of a dark apartment.  Probably would not recommend for people that have children. Did not feel very secure and there was a homeless camp of 5-7 people just down the street a block away if that.  The creek sound was pleasant though from the apartment.
37157862,650252721,2020-08-12,102931235,Ashley,Amanda's place was very clean and the river view was quite nice and relaxing.
37157862,653961207,2020-08-20,88149863,Stacy,"We love staying at Amanda’s, winter or summer, great place with all the touches and quick walk to downtown."
37157862,654399927,2020-08-21,329162548,Paul,.
37157862,655750200,2020-08-23,17368578,Virginia,"Clean and comfortable and close to downtown. But the location isn't great, with a lot of homeless folks hanging out too nearby for my liking (across the street). And the ""Girls Girls Girls"" sign in the house window across the street -- was that just pop art, or ... ?? And there's an upstairs flat above -- the guy was walking around at 3am, opening & closing his balcony door (audibly). And there really was no grass nearby for my dogs to pee on. Not a great fit for me. Might be fine for a business traveler."
37157862,657517031,2020-08-28,358457429,Maria,"We really enjoyed our stay at Amanda’s place. So much that we were ready to move in lol. The place itself was really nice and clean. The kitchen is fully stocked with, pots, pans, plates, cups, utensils. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was spotless. But as awesome as the inside was the best part is definitely the creek running off the deck. It was so relaxing to just sit out there and listen to the water run."
37157862,657955982,2020-08-29,248516600,Donvis,Great place! We all enjoyed it. Communication was great.
37157862,673530970,2020-10-11,15944419,Cindy,A comfortable condo with comfortable beds and a relaxing deck overlooking the creek.
37157862,701217512,2020-10-17,26202727,Kamil,"Great apartment for the price! In my brief research on apartments in Salem there was nothing close to the value this apartments provides. Cozy two separate bedrooms which are very useful when traveling with another couple. Full kitchen to your disposition, coffee equipment. TV with Roku in the living room. Great view at the creek from the balcony. You can hear it in one of the bedrooms too, so it's a great white noise for sleeping. There were some people who were homeless a block away from the apartment but it's understandable as it's few blocks from the downtown. The neighborhood is not sketchy nor dangerous. Definitely recommend."
37157862,702409438,2020-10-20,157647583,Jeremy,"I was in town working on the fires up toward Detroit. My cohorts and I were getting fed up with rampant theft at Double Tree, Hampton, and other hotels out by the interstate. Fire vehicles seemed to be targeted. Alas, I was able to find piece of mind here at Amanda's place. Plenty of parking for a vehicle off street. The creek provided a nice white noise. Good coffee amenities, and this is my primary morning mode so spot on Amanda. As everyone here has pointed out, there is a shelter or two close by. I had no problems with anyone. And also, the walls a bit thin, and the neighbor upstairs carries their weight in the feet. It's not excessive for an apartment, and the creek masks most of it. All and all a great place to stay. Thanks Amanda!"
37157862,702773481,2020-10-22,301909351,Sabrina,"Very clean, very responsive, very easy to get to,  had everything we needed! I would definitely recommend this property to others!"
37157862,704010779,2020-10-25,1233128,Mary,Fantastic view of the stream from the living space and the deck
37157862,706281040,2020-11-02,367105564,Samantha,The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed for a weekend stay. Its location in relation to downtown was absolutely ideal.
37157862,706629922,2020-11-04,91468780,Ana,Great place to stay. Clean and comfortable.
37157862,708219186,2020-11-11,7560288,Amy,Amanda’s space was great! She’s very responsive and made check-in and out a breeze. We woke up and had our coffee listening to the nearby creek. Everything was wonderful and we’d stay again in a heartbeat!
37157862,709164814,2020-11-15,299237142,Thomas,Great place close to everything in Salem. Do I need to do in the surrounding area. FEMA close to downtown it is very relaxing and peaceful.
37157862,710305867,2020-11-21,4924644,Audrey,"We stayed in Amanda’s apartment for the week. The place is super conveniently located within walking distance to a Safeway and restaurants. <br/><br/>There is a waterfront walking/running trail very close by. Bush Park is a few miles away. <br/><br/>We worked and went to school online for the week so WiFi was very important. The WiFi was great! <br/><br/>We wanted to get a feel for Salem as my daughter is interested in Willammette University, which unfortunately canceled their tours due to Covid-19. But we were still able to enjoy this sweet city and walk all around the perimeter of the school. <br/><br/>As others mention, this is a city and the location is right near downtown. So there is noise and people who are homeless since there are service organizations nearby. But we never felt unsafe and walked everywhere."
37157862,711144949,2020-11-24,88149863,Stacy,"Always love staying here: great amenities, clean, comfy beds, and the creek!"
37157862,712025330,2020-11-28,370204194,Richard,"My overall feel for the place was inviting. The location is idea decent for being close to downtown and access the local shopping areas is perfect.  The main critique was lack of comfortable sitting space. However the warmth of the unit made up for that, along with the sound of the rushing water made sleeping easy and peaceful."
37157862,712467355,2020-11-29,100934340,Taylar Elizza Beth,"This place is lowkey, clean, simple & accurately described. Sitting out on the balcony listening to music by the creek was serene. Will definitely be back when I’m in Salem again!"
37157862,712742027,2020-11-30,372860594,Fawn,"Stylish place with comfy beds and beautiful view of Mill creek. Everything is lovely there, great AirBNB!"
37157862,713323268,2020-12-04,26872721,Catie,"Arriving to Amanda’s condo was fairly easy. It is keyless entry and was easy to enter. When we entered the kitchen/living room, it smelled like cat pee. I’m guessing an animal may have stayed there before we did. Luckily the bedrooms did not have the smell. We were going to stay in the bedroom in the back of the condo, closest to the river. It was freezing when we first got there so we turned the electrical heater in the room on while we went to the grocery store so it would be warm when we came back but it attracted ants. Ants came in through a hole in the window frame and got into my bag and were going under the bed. Luckily it was just my boyfriend and I, so the other bedroom was an extra room, so we switched. However it was much noisier in the other room. At night we could hear neighbors coughing up a storm while theyd go out to smoke. One night at 12:30 am we were woken up by blasting country music. A car had pulled up right outside the window to the bedroom and had its doors open, blasting music. <br/>One night, we had just stopped at the condo to drop some things off and we heard the door unlock. Another couple had unlocked the door. The host had sent them the wrong information and gave them our condo address and door code. Fortunately we were home and decent when the other guests unlocked the door and our belongings weren’t disturbed. They seemed like nice people but it’s still unsettling knowing all my belongings and privacy might not have been safe. Then we weren’t sure if anyone else would end up showing up who might’ve been sent the wrong information too. <br/>Overall, a disappointing stay. I would have left and got a hotel or something but I really didn’t want to spend any more money at that point."
37157862,714293142,2020-12-08,287167474,Hayley,The location was great for getting around and being close to amenities. The host had great communication and timely response!

37157862,732012347,2021-02-16,346590043,Michael,Amandas place was spacious and has all the essentials you would need for a night stay! We found everything we needed to get away from Portland for the night. We were happy to be able to do laundry on site and cook our food in an accommodating kitchen. Thanks Amanda!
37157862,732271760,2021-02-17,71619341,Deanna,Great!
37157862,732702386,2021-02-19,386649730,Dino,Amanda is very responsive and took care of my parents when the power went out. She went out of her way to get us in early. My parents reported that everything was perfect. I recommend Amanda’s place!!!<br/><br/>Dino Layton

37157862,387658938003949484,2021-06-18,189085987,Marion,Perfect overnight stay in Salem at a great value.  Appreciate the cleanliness and convenient parking spot.  The running creek off of the patio was the star of the condo.  So relaxing and picturesque!
37157862,388438140751485917,2021-06-19,33244372,Cece,Amanda was awesome. Due to a medical emergency with my husband we were unable to make the trip to Oregon. Amanda still allowed my cousin and his fiance (who were sharing the house with us) to keep the reservation even though they weren't the ones who booked it. Amanda went out of her way to make sure they directly had all the communications the needed for their stay. They said the home was awesome with all the amenities they needed. They said the view from the deck was incredible. They thoroughly enjoyed their stay and my husband and I hope to experience if for ourselves soon!
37157862,389088393211635626,2021-06-20,121568450,Kathleen,Amanda’s Mill Creek condo is a jewel! Overlooking Mill Creek with a nice-sized deck - wonderful. And hearing the creek at night was very relaxing.  We almost decided to skip the event we came down for to hang out on the deck longer!<br/>Everything we could think of was provided. We have stayed in many Airbnbs and this place is right up there on our list. We will most definitely be back!

It had all the amenities you would need and to top it off an awesome creek running behind it with a beautiful deck to sit on and relax. Having the windows open at night and listening to the creek was an added bonus. The location to downtown Salem was perfect. We would definitely stay here again!

There were noisy tenants active in the apartment above at very late hours, which included screaming arguments. There are homeless people across the street, that did stand in and rummage through the apartments dumpster.  I am aware that there is a homeless issue in the cities but they are very close and active near/on this property. The apartment bedrooms were clean and comfortable, the kitchen and bathroom had a few issues with fixtures working well or as stated. The porch with the creek is a nice, large feature."

Being close to downtown is an added bonus - my husband and our Boston Terrier, Rosie, often join me and we enjoy the closeness of town and work. The condo is clean, comfortable, well-stocked with everything we need and plus a deck with a view of Mill Creek. We will definitely return!"

The condo was quiet, sparkling clean, had every comfort of home, and the creek in back is gorgeous. <br/>Was nice to have a fully equipped kitchen, as it is hard to dine out during the pandemic. Will definitely stay there again."
37723906,659156645,2020-08-31,351731626,Mark,Great place. It had everything we needed. We made it our home away from home for 9 days.
37723906,659445463,2020-09-01,152116112,Reyah,Amazing view in the backyard!! Could not get over the creek! The condo is located in a great spot making it convenient to access some major stores and spots of interest. They do a great job with keeping the place incredibly clean and smelling good. Would highly recommend booking if in the area. One car parking only.

37723906,663363740,2020-09-12,363200192,Stanton,"Amanda's place was exactly as described. It was very clean, quiet and comfortable at a great price point. She was extremely quick to respond, instantaneous actually, when we had minor difficulty with the automatic front door lock. The old neighborhood around the condo complex is eclectic and walkable. If not for the wildfire smoke, we would have enjoyed the back deck overlooking Mill Creek morning and evening. <br/>Highly recommend Amanda's place for your stay in Salem. <br/>Thanks Amanda"

This condo fit the bill. The sound of the creek outside our window was quite soothing, no extraneous noise and the bed was so comfortable.  We went on our way fully rested, just what we wanted."

37723906,722590484,2021-01-07,51368813,Ashley,"My stay at Amanda’s place was just about  what I expected. The view from the balcony was what sold me on the stay, the beautiful little creak was an amazing morning view. However I would say the price of my stay was a bit much for the area and the community, Amanda’s place is technically a condo but situated as a small apartment complex with thin walls. The biggest issue I came across while staying here was that there was NO hot water to shower with. BOTH bathrooms do not even get a lukewarm temperature, so if you like to take a hot or even a WARM shower this is not  the place for you. Overall I would rate Amanda’s place as 3 stars"
37723906,723458904,2021-01-10,353470012,Teaeasha,it's a it's a beautiful place to get away just to relax and if you love to fall asleep to the sound of Rushing Water this is ideal I recommend this for anybody who wants to experience and enjoy an Airbnb. Great location close to shopping quiet neighborhood

Easy walking distance from downtown Salem. And with a wonderful flowing creek and wild blackberries in the back providing a nice nature vibe and wonderful ""soundtrack"" for falling asleep at night. It worked well as a base for my crew visiting family nearby."

We didn’t use the kitchen much because there are lots of great places to eat. You must try Fork Forty and Busick Court.  There are a lot of Thrift stores and reuse places. A really neat shop to check out was called, Furbis."

Slept well with the window open to hear the noise of the creek outside. We travelled with our dog so pet-friendly was a must and morning and evening walks with the dog were a breeze.  Would definitely stay again."
37723906,489219148464533266,2021-11-05,58618318,Selina,It felt like home away from home. So glad to get off the road and into a comfortable bed.  The view of the creek alone was my favorite part. But being able to cook breakfast and dinner for the kids. Amanda had board games and a Roku tv which we watched movies together. Pet friendly. And the location was absolutely ideal as you are centrally located to everything. Wish she wasn’t booked out so far so we could have stayed longer. It was a lucky chance we got to stay for 2 days. Thank you!
37723906,502281724965301097,2021-11-23,116532432,Daniyal,Ms. Amanda was very accommodating  and her place was comfortable with all the necessities.

The bathrooms were stocked with body wash, shampoo, conditioner, and TP. There is also no shortage of blankets and towels! The view out back is beautiful. There is a stream in the back that was enjoyable to listen to at night.<br/>This was a very comfortable stay, and would absolutely stay again."

37723906,607360637653631312,2022-04-17,41509964,Saskia,"The condo was very well organized, was generally clean and tidy and very spacious with lots of cooking implements and we loves the sound of the river at night. Perfect location, very cute street. I did feel the place needed some general maintenance which caused some discomfort - mainly, upon entering the place we were greeted with a strong mildewy smell which we needed to air out daily,  perhaps just a product of the heavy rain and old building but it did dampen the experience (pun intended) and if people are sensitive to mold or mold smells this might be an important heads up."
37723906,616737328086529378,2022-04-30,453216846,Nancy,"The condo was great, spacious and right by a beautiful creek, great parking and all that was needed to cook was provided. The location, as Amanada mentioned is centrally located, within 10 minutes of all we needed, with that came some local homeless folks in the area, but we had no issues at all. <br/>The Condo is vintage ;) and very reasonably priced, we had a maintenance issue that Amanda resolved as soon as she could and she adjusted our fee for the inconvenience. We would stay again!"
37723906,618177619893597720,2022-05-02,454744594,Jodi,There was a strong foul order that needs to be managed. The creek view  in the back is lovely and the sound of rushing water is peaceful. Close to Williamette University and the Capital.

37723906,628337032495286753,2022-05-16,445440302,Michael,"A completely functional 2 br apartment at a good price. The place was clean, the furniture functional (if sparse given the relatively large size of the living room) and the beds comfortable. The heat worked well, and having individual, silent units in each room is a plus.  The stream out back is a delight (nice to look at and creates a great sound).  The management company could use a few pointers as they missed some obvious things during turnover: missing coffee pot, bulbs burned out in bathroom, no soap/shampoo in the shower (or let people know to bring their own).  Overall, I'd stay in the unit again next time I'm in Salem."
37723906,630484146474211802,2022-05-19,454318356,David,Great place and Amanda is the best to work with.  Everything met our needs.  I would recommend this wo anyone.
37723906,632699737042422189,2022-05-22,456464649,Curtis,"We bought a home, with a 30 day escrow and no place to stay with a pet.  New to the area, we found Creekside.  These are very spacious units for the money spent, and we have stayed in 4 of them.  They are clean, equipped with everything you would need, and works as a home away from home.  Complete kitchen, bathrooms, and bedrooms..plus the added feature is a roaring brook…in California it would be a river,  just outside the  balcony.  <br/>If you can use a computer, iPad, or phone, you are set to sign-up for a non-person experience that is efficient and workable.  We even pushed the limits by staying days beyond our original time which was worked out with Amanda…and was successful.<br/>It is an inner city area, with a homeless population nearby.  We didn’t have any issues with this and the homeless seemed to respect us as we did them."
37723906,633439419727712533,2022-05-23,138072301,Gladys,"Amanda's place is very spacious and clean. I loved that it has two full bathrooms, heater, and it's own parking spot right in front of the unit. My husband and I ordered dinner from Cozy Taberna. I recommend this place if you are staying at Amanda's place.."
37723906,634077101201813645,2022-05-24,140669674,Loretta,"Amanda a very friendly and responsive host. Her apartment was clean and just as described. There were plenty of towels, extra blankets and pillows and she even had some microwave popcorn out for us."

37723906,642860816487310721,2022-06-05,371192813,Bethany,Great communication. The place has potential. Central location.

37723906,651555013064777965,2022-06-17,460651315,Donald,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Loved the great view of the creek from the balcony, we liked sitting out there in the mornings enjoying our coffee and tea listening to the peaceful sound of the creek running by. The beds were very comfortable, plenty of towels and toiletries. We mostly cooked breakfast but it has everything needed if you wanted to cook more. Amanda was very nice made sure our stay was a pleasant one."
37723906,653002070450159862,2022-06-19,32206898,Charlotte,Our wedding guests stayed here for my wedding weekend. I rented 4 apartments in the complex from Amanda to host them. All of were happy!
37723906,654411193511445281,2022-06-21,462539702,Jesse,Great host exact like very clean and stocked great view.
37723906,658727557937531462,2022-06-27,451706364,Sarah,"The condo was excellent for our stay. It was centrally located for where we were going and was very clean and spacious for our group. Sitting on the back porch in the morning listening to the creek was such an added bonus. There is plenty of closet space and even though the temp was in the 90s during our stay, the condo stayed pretty cool considering there is only the A/C unit in the master. There are quite a few homeless people down the street, but they were friendly and non-invasive during the stay. We never felt like we were unsafe or anything. Highly recommend the condo! Kid friendly and lots of ammenities as far as entertainment goes!"
37723906,664564572821236616,2022-07-05,452617951,Susan,"This place was amazing! Clean, spacious and perfect for my family of 4. I’d highly recommend it and would stay here again."

Comfortable and cozy, attention to detail and a lovely view off the balcony.  Lots of cozy blankets, good products in the bathrooms, comfy beds.. I could go on and on, but maybe you should experience it for yourself. You won't regret it!"
37723906,668920235296140873,2022-07-11,305769731,Rachel,The condo was clean and had a good location.  Definitely was what we needed for our time in Salem.

37723906,718179501608872235,2022-09-17,413595916,Jeff,"Had a nice stay, we check in late and left early in the morning so we did not get to enjoy the area.  Amanda was great at communicating and check in was smooth with no issues."

37723906,726858432120063850,2022-09-29,478483397,Marcus,Amanda was a pleasure to deal with. We were very happy with our choice!
37723906,728326412854557445,2022-10-01,239972690,Samantha,"A decent place to stay but completely unreliable internet. We were unable to stream anything or even use social media for any length of time. Tried reaching out to the host but didn't hear back about any troubleshooting during our stay. <br/>Also was advertised as a safe neighborhood, and it may be for the Salem area, but as someone traveling from out of town there were quite a few homeless people camped outside a community center about 100 yards away and an apparent squatter house next door. We felt inside, but not walking/running around the neighborhood."
37723906,752269035997896379,2022-11-03,54891460,Kévin,"Nice accommodation in Salem.<br/>The condo is very well furnished.<br/>Although it is close to a homeless place, we have never been disturbed. The terrace with the view on the creek is very nice.<br/>Amanda is a great host. She is very available and has been very helpful in the organization of our trip, including when we had to modify our travel dates.<br/>We really recommend it!!"

37723906,760280425182527356,2022-11-14,4228853,Ellen,A very affordable and easy stay for me and my parents! This place is clean and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. We really liked having a kitchen and staying together as a family in a 2 bedroom place instead of a hotel. The couch in the living room works great as an extra bed and is comfortable. SO much better as an option instead of a hotel. The neighborhood and creek behind is great.
37723906,761744583485566060,2022-11-16,309367015,Sarah,"Cozy, quiet, private and clean"

37723906,776900924566820078,2022-12-07,412166552,Solomon,"Amanda is truly a Superhost, she responds in a timely manner if ever I have any questions. Her place is on a ground level, very homey, super clean, quiet and has comfortable queen size beds. There is an active creek in front of the balcony  with soothing sound. The Amenities as advertised are readily available, kitchen is well stocked. Covered assigned parking  space is directly across the unit entrance which makes it so convenient for unloading luggages. The unit is located in a well kept residential area of downtown so expect the usual scenery as like any other cities. We felt safe even with the house less shelter located about 2 blocks away. I would highly recommend Amanda and her place. Thank you Amanda for being so accommodating."
37723906,779074017569872668,2022-12-10,50692685,Audrea,"Convenient location for anywhere you would need to go in Salem. Place was well stocked and had everything we need. It was nice to have covered parking, especially with the rain. Bed was super comfy and it was nice to fall asleep to the sound of the creek outside. Big wall of windows looking out over the creek is probably very pretty in the spring with everything is green and the big deck would be nice to sit and enjoy the sound of the creek. Amanda was very easy to communicate with. I would definitely recommend Amanda's place, it has everything you need in a convenient location at a great price."
37723906,779834780634037708,2022-12-11,15944419,Cindy,Amanda was an amazing host!! She was really quick to respond to any questions and was also very flexible with us. The condo is older but is kept in immaculate condition with very comfortable beds that made for a great night's sleep. We have stayed in one of her other condos in the same complex before and we had a great experience that time too. Amanda's condo will be the first place we check if we need to stay in Salem again. Thank you Amanda!!
37723906,782742552617203777,2022-12-15,23941716,Angelina,"Wonder, clean place to stay."
37723906,784850394884859003,2022-12-18,163450269,Shawna,"Amanda was super friendly and helpful, provided great instructions for location, check-in, check-out, nearby attractions and helping us secure a second parking place for our stay.  <br/><br/>Loved the river behind the property, the coziness and cleanliness of the place and provided amenities.  The internet was a little slow at times but worked best in the living room.   Would definitely stay again."
37723906,787861318804352401,2022-12-22,207398595,Audra,Amanda was super helpful and responded quickly.

37723906,795803807379784205,2023-01-02,170996249,Nancy,I went for a pamper. I found this spot to be healing and happy. The roaring water at the back made it wild and fun and wonderful! The neighborhood was perfect for long Luna walks. She is 18 this year. She loved this place. Thank you so much.
37723906,800078329114947811,2023-01-08,58763802,Mindy,"This property is exactly as described. It fit our family of five just fine. We appreciated the proximity to downtown Salem. <br/><br/>I especially enjoyed the extra touches like fans in the closets of both bedrooms, and the beautiful rippling brook behind the apartment. Lots of extra towels and comforters are also available in the hall closet. <br/><br/>Being in an apartment style complex - we expected to hear more noise from neighbors around us, but it was a very peaceful stay. Quiet and relaxing.<br/><br/>We opened the windows and plugged in our oil difffuser upon arrival to “freshen it up” - but we do that in several properties. We read the description carefully and knew to expect a dated building- so this didn’t bother or surprise us."
37723906,806685089343403161,2023-01-17,485334070,Anya,"Amanda is a great host! Very kind and honest too, she let us stayed at her other unit while the unit we were supposed to stay at were being repaired. The place was clean, we love how we can hear the creek flowing from the bedroom window. Location is convenient because everything is walking distant. Really enjoyed our stay and we would definitely book again :) thank you for being an amazing host!"
37723906,811666581242671958,2023-01-24,83064981,Bethany,Absolutely loved the location and the place.  It was exactly what we needed for a getaway with my boyfriend and our dog.  Very easy to find.  Walking distance from downtown which made it easy for us as well.  The condo had everything we needed and wasn't over cluttered so it felt refreshing to be there.  The cost was very fair.  Anytime I head to Salem I will definitely try to stay here.
37723906,813126348585775676,2023-01-26,142307475,Erik,Exactly as advertised. Low rate. Great for a short business trip. Will definitely look too stay here again.

37723906,822532084135756347,2023-02-08,165202962,Daryl,Location was within 2 blocks of where I was working. It enabled me to walk to work while leaving my car on property. The fact that there was a dedicated parking space proved very helpful. Convenient to downtown and other amenities.
37723906,823983129110970166,2023-02-10,180277878,Tracy,"Aside from the small raised threshold at the front door, this listing was ideal for my son, who uses a mobility scooter. The halls are wide and the home is clutter free. The apartment did have an unpleasant odor. This listing could be enhanced  by an expert cleaning and the insulation of windows locks as the existing ones don’t properly lock.."
37723906,825511384138841758,2023-02-12,40234737,Sherry,"The location of Amanda’s place is very close to downtown, the Capitol and Willamette University. The price is good for the budget traveler."

Love that you have a parking place literally right outside the door. Easy to walk to grocery store, waterfront park area and tons of downtown shops and restaurants. Perfect for a visit with a Willamette University student. Well equipped kitchen, comfortable beds and plenty of extra linens and blankets. The host provides very detailed information and is quick to respond. We will definitely book again."

37723906,846525111529117796,2023-03-13,190584144,Danae,"Amanda was a proactive and responsive host. The space was comfortable and inviting. The two bathrooms were a plus. We did have a small issue with the heating, as we couldn’t get it to be cool enough in the bedrooms (in March); but, better for the heaters to work than not! Amanda was gracious when we told her and was going to look into it right away. We loved the layout of the kitchen, dining, and living rooms. Favorite part was the view of the creek—the patio looked nice! It was just too cold outside for us to use it."
37815385,564436758,2019-11-15,121210348,Jay,"Riley and Cory are really nice people.  They’re friendly and helpful, and really relaxed.  I was their first guest, and they did a fantastic job!  I’d definitely recommend staying with them if you’re looking for a simple, clean, inexpensive room!"
37815385,566835917,2019-11-20,121210348,Jay,Riley and Corey are great hosts.  They go out of their way to be accommodating in any way they can.  I’d definitely recommend them in the future.

37815385,579079046,2019-12-19,37367232,L.H.,"It was great to have an affordable place to stay on my overnight trip to Salem.  I didn't get to see Riley, but he was helpful over the phone and by message. Cory met me while I was entering the room, and was friendly and helpful.  The bedroom is in a converted garage, but the bed was super comfortable, plenty of comfy pillows, extra fluffy blanket, and an adorable stuffed doggie.  Just in case it would be important to you, the kitchen does not have a microwave.  But there is a Vitamix! I didn't have occasion use it, but how cool is that?"

The bathroom has a lock which is a weird thing to be happy about but couple other places that I’ve been to didn’t. Very convenient and I look forward coming back again.

37815385,663027259,2020-09-11,355479731,Pamela,Although I didn’t meet Riley and Cory you would not know if they were there or not because the place is very quiet in a good way...you do have your own entrance and a lock on the bedroom door for security.  The bathroom is also right outside the bedroom with a shower.  It was Perfect and convenient. I would definitely recommend and stay again.

37815385,748062300,2021-04-11,258067511,Jessica,"This is a very basic room. Great host! However, the room has a strong musty odor which is concerning. The door knob is loose and we heard a lot of loud cursing during our stay. The quiet hours were respected though. Not a bad spot for an adult looking to stay a night but nothing fancy either."
37815385,750634383,2021-04-20,164464589,Alyssa,"Riley and Cory were great hosts! The room is comfortable and it was a bonus for us that there was a separate entrance. The house was quiet and we were not disturbed at all during our stay. All lot of great amenities to feel right at home too!<br/><br/>Riley and Cory are very friendly and will gladly answer questions or chat about anything. They gave us great recommendations about places to eat around the area. Overall, this is a great place to stay whether you are social or introverted person!<br/><br/>- Regan and Alyssa"

37815385,766325740,2021-06-04,172731544,Mary,"Private entrance to room. Tv in room was great; no cable which was fine with me. Use of my own bathroom....the way I like it. Bed was creaky. Room had hangers, coffee stuff, filtered water. I had to use the hand soap in the shower. <br/>I was a little disappointed that the host didn't greet me in person, but she stated it was because of Covid-19. I don't know if she was fully vaccinated, but I was.<br/>The price was GREAT! <br/>There wasn't any place to sit outside.<br/>There was Air Conditioning-----thank God.<br/>I would stay here again."

37815385,393548757549112837,2021-06-26,75246496,Beth,The description is completely accurate and the hosts are the sweetest people you'll ever meet. As a woman traveling alone I felt very safe in this private room in a shared home. Lots of sweet touches! Thank you for the TV and Netflix! I was a little bummed that the room smelled like cigarette smoke because I had read in the description that smoking is only allowed outside. The only things that would have made the room even better is a new mattress. Light sleepers should know that this room faces a pretty busy neighborhood throughway.
37815385,402208438877354352,2021-07-08,404954575,Emily,"Cute little room with a large TV and an almost private bath. Lots of personal touches like sunscreen, coffee, and candies! Very private, we almost didn’t know anyone else was home. I loved the separate entrance. The price is incredible and the room feels like you’re staying in your family’s spare room. It was perfect for our needs. I would definitely recommend this room!"

37815385,422544200496013427,2021-08-05,6135702,Mary,"This was an ideal place for me, quiet, clean, thoughtful amenties and within walking distance of Amtrak, Greyhound and Safeway. The two hosts were wonderful to chat with. Had a very nice time and would definately stay here again if i go back to Salem."
37815385,424714493738015645,2021-08-08,182972710,Logan,It's a private room attached to the host's house. It'spretty private. Hosts do a good job communicating.

37815385,438418965062496135,2021-08-27,609815,Ken,"I spent three nights at Riley's place in Salem. It's really cozy and comfortable with lots of thoughtful touches. I was in the midst of work projects, and finished a couple of deadlines while I was there--the internet worked great. I loved that the room was safe and private, and also close to downtown.  It's an excellent value. I'd gladly stay again."
37815385,446359475613436019,2021-09-07,267702930,Anna,"Very nice walkable neighborhood.  Riley is a super good host, very welcoming and accommodating.  Would definitely stay there again."
37815385,464537603053602750,2021-10-02,329764640,Itziar,"I stayed at Riley's house for a week, I had my own entrance to the bedroom from the driveway, and from the room I could access the rest of the house, like a bathroom that was for my use only. The room was very well equipped for a week, and it included coffee and tea, a little table, extra towels,  blankets, and a TV with Netflix. The kitchen was well equipped and there was access to the laundry too, although I didn't use it. Riley respected my privacy, and was always happy to adjust anything like more room in the fridge for my food or give me some recommendations for the life in the city."
37815385,469594394942500036,2021-10-09,1169189,Jesse,"Very nice hosts. Travelers should know that the house is not very sound or smell insulated. The room is next to the kitchen and you can smell and hear everything that happens in the house. I’m not particularly sound sensitive, but the smell was a bit much for me. This spot was an excellent value and perfect for what I needed—an affordable place to stay in Salem for several days."
37815385,473271576623929271,2021-10-14,23263569,Lillian,Lots of nice little touches like chargers for your device. Hosts were very friendly and quick with replying to messages. The mattress is uncomfortable; my back didn’t feel good after two nights on in.
37815385,476110188960565204,2021-10-18,1353010,Ben,Great host! Fast communication! Private room in a great spot in the city. Walking distance to everything. 10/10

37815385,497124279083705399,2021-11-16,384207913,Dalith,"This was my first ever air b&b stay and I must say IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE!! Everything from beginning to end was super easy. When we got there (very late at that)  we had our own side of the driveway, our own door to the room with our own pin.  The room itself was super cozy, very clean with a  comfy bed, we had access to our own bathroom, access to a kitchen, washer/dryer and even toiletries!! I had the pleasure of meeting Riley, Cory and even Delta (the cat) and they're such great peeps, I'm glad I was able to find them!!! I know where I'll be staying again when I do end up going back to Salem, hopefully they'll be available then!!"
37815385,500746388978262331,2021-11-21,292705987,Michael,This a perfect spot if you are looking for peace and quiet for your stay. I work as a traveling nurse and this property is perfect when you have brief stays for a good sleep between shifts.
37815385,506629096250310462,2021-11-29,372808670,Ashley,"Perfect space for our week long stay, Riley had everything we could need in our room for us! The room and bathroom felt very private, and the separate entrance was nice since I am a night shift travel nurse and came home early in the mornings. Definitely recommend booking, host was very friendly, and great with communication. I would definitely stay again."

38976509,584863827,2019-12-30,973145,Eric,"Ruth's bunkhouse was a perfect fit for my needs. I have family a couple of blocks away and it was getting a little too crowded and crazy after the holidays. The bunkhouse was warm and cozy with eccentric decor and positioned in a fun garden/backyard. With no plumbing and a dry toilet, it might not be for everyone but I personally liked those touches and the effort to keep it green. Would recommend for someone looking for a simple, quiet, and affordable place to rest."
38976509,598243775,2020-01-26,304138796,Amira,"Ruth's Bunkhouse is great! It's a small space, but a great value for the location and she has made it very nice and cozy inside. Ruth was very hospitable and welcoming, and even added some nice little touches such as some snacks, tea, and coffee. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
38976509,605522668,2020-02-14,52128523,Ben,"It’s more of a well-converted garden shed than a tiny house but if you don’t need much in terms of amenities and just want a place to crash, it’s very cozy and a great price!"
38976509,617730552,2020-03-13,108183605,Forrest,"Nice host, good location, great value."

38976509,708575639,2020-11-13,162927377,Jonathan,"My stay at Ruth’s was truly remarkable. She catered to me in a time of need and was incredibly respectful of COVID protocol. The space was perfect for a cute, self sustained getaway and Ruth/ her tiny home catered to all my necessities and beyond, especially for the price! I stayed for a week during a quarantine after weeks of fighting fires and found myself feeling a sense of home that brought tears to my eyes. Salem is a beautiful city with so much to see and explore and Ruth’s Airbnb was an amazing base to head out of hikes, and take (social distanced) walks. Thank you thank you thank you Ruth! It was the truest pleasure and I wish you luck on your future guests, as well as future stays when you explore the Southwest!"
38976509,711313605,2020-11-25,7509804,Katya,"I had a great stay, Ruth is a fantastic host, and the place is really charming. Be sure to read the (very accurate) description of the place, because it isn't for everyone, I imagine. If you're comfortable living without some of your usual every day luxuries, you'll really enjoy staying at the bunkhouse."
38976509,715764753,2020-12-15,378492077,Ian,Excellent communication.
38976509,724057439,2021-01-13,383830218,Col,"The Bunkhouse is a delightful space that is something of a cross between a tiny house and a cabin. The area is comfortable and cozy and has a good selection of books. Furthermore, Ruth is a wonderful host. I highly recommend the Bunkhouse!"
38976509,727354304,2021-01-28,374779855,Grace,Nice little cabin feel. It was a really nice size for me and my little dog. She got to run around the yard too which was really convenient. There was some food and tea available that made my mornings and evenings extra special.
38976509,735770516,2021-03-01,7271543,Tara,"i absolutely loved staying at the bunkhouse. i felt so welcomed by ruth. she left many thoughtful touches, and her warmth is unparalleled. the bunkhouse is adorable and just what i needed to slow down and reconnect with myself. the space adapted well to my needs, and everything i needed was there. nice neighborhood to walk through with a creek nearby."
38976509,747432339,2021-04-10,346208905,Kayla,Ruth was very helpful and quick to respond.  I thought not having running water would be a huge hassle but it wasn't that bad and Ruth provided me with plenty if water. Overall I would 100% recommend and would stay again.

Lots of heart and beautiful creativity in this space, that allows for quiet respite. Would definitely recommend if you are in the Salem area. I was fortunate to stay here for 3 months while finishing up grad school and easily found shower etc… and incredibly grateful to have been able to be hosted by Ruth."

38980158,612537874,2020-02-29,5709770,Sharon,"Just what I needed.....I had been living in Salem for 3 months while working at Salem Health and had one more month to go.  While the initial hosts (not an airbnb) were nice the living conditions were not.  I rented from these airbnb hosts for the last month I was in Salem and it was wonderful.  The hosts are super nice, quick to respond, and always available for any needs.  As my month was ending, I felt more like I was staying with friends and in their warm welcoming home.  Highly recommend if you are visiting Salem or if working at Salem Health as it's a very close and in walking distance."

I give it a 10 star rating!<br/>you get so much for the value of what you get for what you're spending. I love the room I was staying in the bed is very comfortable, I truly enjoyed having my privacy. And even though I shared a bathroom with another Airbnb guest it didn't feel like I was sharing it with anyone at all. Beautiful house, with a whole lot of amenities at your fingertips! my room is very private and I needed a two-day rest from a long work week as many hours and that's exactly what I got! Thank you so much Jennifer! I will stay here again and again. Very clean & Tidy and Wonderful host!!"

There are 2 bedrooms per floor that share a bathroom. We stayed upstairs with a Craig who was very welcoming and his adorable 2 year old. <br/><br/>The mattress is extremely soft so if you have any back problems, this may be an issue.<br/><br/>Her house is located in a quiet neighborhood."

39128949,629111083,2020-06-12,5531234,Casey,"Robert was an outstanding host.  His home is beautifully designed. From the first day to the last, Robert was always quick when communicating, providing the best hospitality throughout our stay."
39128949,632356240,2020-06-26,25376812,Debra,"Hands down THE best Airbnb experience we have EVER had. The home was more stunning than the pictures portray. The location was supreme (we had fresh cherries picked from a tree on an EMPTY lot every morning during our walk!). It could not have been more perfect! Every single thing we could possibly need was in this house. We lacked nothing!  Communication with Robert (who lives in Europe!) was always timely and we had a local contact if needed. In the age of COVID, Robert was more than understanding of our concerns and addressed them with the utmost respect & compassion. We were so sad leaving and are already trying to figure out when we can return. This vacation, which was difficult for us as we moved our son up to Salem for school & “adulting” was made less difficult by having this gorgeous home to return to each day after the hours of helping our son. We will be back!! Thank you Robert for trusting us in your ultra comfortable, showpiece of a home."
39128949,659231259,2020-08-31,4997225,Rayman,"Roberts place exceeded our expectations. The house is beautifully designed and very thoughtfully put together; the upscale kitchen had all the appliances we needed, and the view was incredible. Robert is also very responsive and was glad to have an opportunity to meet in person. Would recommend this place without any reservation."
39128949,666902115,2020-09-21,58902160,Lindsay,"Roberts home is not only stunning both inside and out but the amenities, cleanliness and thoughtfulness that went into this BnB is top notch. My family and I loved our stay and can't wait to visit again. If you are coming to Salem, stop your search now. Robert's place is one of a kind and you won't be disappointed."
39128949,671231627,2020-10-04,89775385,Michael,Such an amazing place. Robert was an amazing host and we couldn't have asked for anything more in our stay
39128949,710781140,2020-11-22,196292680,Sarah,"An absolutely wonderful stay! The house is beautiful with many meaningful touches to the decoration. We stayed for a little over a month, and the house started to feel like home. Robert is an outstanding host who really cares about making the stay comfortable. The house is stocked with all kitchen/daily life essentials. Would recommend to anyone who is visiting Salem."
39128949,721676512,2021-01-03,33716963,Adam,"This is probably the best Airbnb we have stayed in.  It’s like living in a 1960’s movie set, or a museum, but with many modern touches.  Robert is a great communicator, and he has stocked the house with everything that you could possibly need.  The view is incredible, the beds are comfortable and the kitchen and bathrooms are clean.  We highly recommend this house."
39128949,737622910,2021-03-08,179019540,Samantha,My friend and I stayed in Robert’s home for 2 months. It was a beautiful home in a very safe neighborhood. The views were incredible! Robert was very quick to respond to any needs. We would love to come back! :)

39128949,746679887,2021-04-07,135580982,Christine,One of a kind with amazing views!
39128949,748930148,2021-04-15,25164048,Duane,"Robert is an attentive, communicative host--simply the best I've encountered on AirB&B. The house is well appointed, and the kitchen well equipped with anything you need for cooking. The linens are top quality, and I appreciated having skylights in the bathrooms and walk-in closet.<br/><br/>The covered patio off the sunroom/kitchen has a table with comfortable chairs, and the grassy yard off the living room is perfect for tai chi or yoga. Overall, the property is impeccable, with beautiful landscaping. And the view . . . well, it's astounding. A delight to watch the sun change on the coastal range while looking out over the Willamette Valley and Minto-Brown Park.<br/><br/>Note that the bottom level of the house is an apartment; it has a separate entrance, and the tenant is quiet and respectful, but you will hear some noise and see her (and her small dog) in the yard below."
39128949,753400250,2021-04-30,99290544,Rani,"I was in search of renting a mid-century modern home in Oregon and immediately settled on Mulberry House when I saw the pictures of the home. Robert was very easy to communicate with (even though he lives in Paris and there is a considerable time difference) and he was very flexible when my dates shifted a bit. The home is lovely and exceeded my expectations. The gardens are tranquil and filled with flowering trees and I was delighted to be able to enjoy them during Spring. On one or two days, the temp reached the mid/high 80s and I was grateful for the option of turning on the AC for a bit. The kitchen was well outfitted and I was able to cook as I do at home. Minto Brown park is close by and I spent many afternoons walking around and exploring it. It was an idyllic two weeks and I am looking forward to renting again in the near future. 💓"
39128949,756788511,2021-05-09,172672440,Kamil,It was a very stylish house. Very accurate with the photos. Perfect view and very good neighborhood.<br/>Our team loved the place.
39128949,759738464,2021-05-17,19595581,Amanda,"We rented Robert's house for the weekend during Willamette's graduation ceremonies. It was the ideal spot for our family to return to at the end of the day after enjoying Salem, wine country, and the coast. Since the graduation was virtual, the house even provided a nice backdrop as our daughter was spotlighted over zoom during the ceremony. The house is well equipped, clean, and has a super cool mid-century modern vibe. It is in a quiet neighborhood and has a gorgeous view of the sunset. If we ever return to Salem, I would definitely want to stay here again. I am an Airbnb host myself, so I know when it is done right. I highly recommend this house!"
39128949,762626831,2021-05-25,150128256,Erin,Beautiful home in Salem. Very clean with comfy beds and lots of space .

39128949,767909823,2021-06-07,60609795,Eden,Perfect place. The view and windows were amazing. Authentic and more than the photos can capture. Recommended x 10.

Check in was a breeze and communication with Robert is very easy. The neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful, and super close to Minto Brown Park. My wife and baby and I enjoyed all of the spaces, including the outdoor patio and indoor fireplace. We would love to stay here again when we are in the area."

39128949,492875308348466070,2021-11-10,183743677,Gianna,"Beautiful house, very clean. We loved the fireplace was great for visiting family. Everything went very smoothly. I may have missed it when booking this air bnb but my family and I weren’t aware that there is a permanent tenant living in the lower house. When we got to the air bnb we heard a dog bark downstairs as we were confused we read the guest book and it informed us then but not before booking. At first we were all confused  but now we know and we visit Salem often so we would 100% rebook for more family vacation.  Great house for friend and family to get together!"
39128949,496381783415159131,2021-11-15,119629275,Jodi,"We so enjoyed our stay here! Robert is an excellent host, checks in with you and is quick to respond with any questions you may have. <br/><br/>And that view! Gorgeous. Would highly recommend this home and will be back someday."
39128949,595710456864864742,2022-04-01,273026808,Shaina,"Robert home is located in Salem only 7 minutes from the hospital that we were working for a contract. The home is equipped with every basic necessities needed. Beautiful home over looking the valley , very quiet and serene neighborhood. Loved waking up and looking over the valley from my bedroom. The house is in a very nice location driving to site seeing was easy no hassle, a must stay while in Oregon ! Although there’s a tenant downstairs and her cute dog 🐶, we didn’t have any issues with her , she is a lovely lady and her dog didn’t make any sound whatsoever. We were here for 8 weeks and staying here was all worth it ! Thank you Robert for opening your home to us !! And we hope to be back soon to visit Oregon !!"
39128949,624667437004647808,2022-05-11,10932812,Celia,"This home was absolutely beautiful, perfect for our group of 4. We loved the fireplace, the beautiful evening views and sunsets. The best place to come home to after exploring the Valley and wine tasting."
39128949,629757571547773232,2022-05-18,83895907,Maurice,"Great, special house just as the owner described. Beautiful, mid-century charm with spectacular landscape and views. Peaceful, quiet, everything you need. Minutes to downtown. We had a family gathering for a college graduation: all of us were extremely comfortable and vey taken aback by the quality and condition of the home and furnishings. Lucky to find such a unique, well-maintained and equipped place. Strongest recommendation."
39128949,639196868603567967,2022-05-31,184506701,Suzanne,I can't say enough about how much we enjoyed this airbnb.  There's light everywhere and the mid-century modern decor is fantastic.  There's a very well-equipped kitchen and a spectacular fireplace for those rainy nights.  We felt very comfortable and it was great to come back to every night.
39128949,648639946934628548,2022-06-13,59682779,Karen,Every word of praise for this home is well deserved. PERIOD!
39128949,658773227606978438,2022-06-27,427447724,Melissa,"The Mulberry house was everything and more! My family and I enjoyed the house so much!  After long days of sightseeing we were able to come back to the Mulberry house relax and spend time together sitting outside, playing games or watching Netflix. Very comfortable!!"
39128949,663838283367623319,2022-07-04,76012353,Amy,"Wonderful home. Well stocked kitchen, nice appliances and evening views to die for. Very centrally located for wine tasting, day trips to Portland, Newport Beach, Mount Hood and of course wine tasting. Comfortable beds and plenty of room to spread out. Neighborhood was nice and safe. I enjoyed walks admiring neighbors landscaping and quaint homes."
39128949,669688557154772049,2022-07-12,109836636,Will,This stay was fantastic. Host cares about details so it was like having a vacation at home…except cooler! Home is decorated with mid century care and design work that takes trust and care. The kitchen and outside are suited for everything you need to enjoy meals at home. The area is easy and cool and a departure! Plenty of comfortable space. Recommend strongly for those who want to get completely away.
39128949,726834042448292733,2022-09-29,428571820,Daniel,"One of the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. Beautiful house, spacious and well stocked kitchen. Really recommend!"
39128949,733410965822982883,2022-10-08,18979915,Cathy,"This place was everything as described - a tranquil location in a very quiet neighborhood - magnificent views of the distant mountains - and pitch perfect accommodations.  Everything had been thought of - couldn't find fault of any sort.  A really well equipped kitchen for cooks and two chill out spaces - one with TV and one without - this one essential for you to enjoy the calm and quality of the mid-century decor.  Quite stunning.<br/>We briefly met Colette - the downstairs neighbor -  and Katie, her dog - after which we heard not a sound from below - no intrusion whatsoever - but very nice to know that there is a 'local' on hand if required.<br/>I have no reservation in recommending this excellent property for an 'upscale' stay in Salem."
39128949,763129671774887877,2022-11-18,11242940,Alyssa,"I stayed at Robert's place for about 2 weeks while my home in the area was being renovated. I was relieved to be able to leave my construction zone of a house and be welcomed with such a beautiful and comfortable place to settle into. It was absolutely spotless, beautifully furnished and the kitchen was not only as well stocked as my own, but with cookware of quality that you can actually use! I have found this to not be very common when staying at other BnB's, the few things that are supplied are often in a condition that makes it difficult to cook with. I found clear instructions and info posted throughout the home, making it easy to settle in and know how things work and what the expectations were. The neighborhood is absolutely beautiful and friendly and the view from the living spaces is incredible. I caught so many stunning sunsets while relaxing by the fireplace in the living room. I highly recommend a stay here, you won't be disappointed!"

39969910,620135202,2020-03-20,162558545,Lynsie,"I would 100% recommend staying here, I am so sad to be leaving. I was here for 6 weeks and I had everything I needed! It has tons of great amenities, like a fireplace, a garage, washer dryer, dishwasher, full kitchen, two TVs with Xfinity, and a super comfy king sized bed. The location was great. Judy was a great host and was always quick getting back to me and is just a friendly person. I really hope I can stay here again!"
39969910,622222711,2020-04-11,40896898,David,"Our stay at Judy’s place was very comfortable and nice, (despite new rules around Coronavirus).  The home is/was well equipped, with everything we needed for our extended stay.  Having a kitchen set up that someone has taken care to include everything, as well as a washer and dryer in the unit, exceptional.  <br/>We enjoyed our stay, being able to walk to Bush Park and Roadhouse.  The neighborhood felt very safe and comfortable.  I would definitely recommend this duplex to others.<br/>(A new barbecue was delivered, while we were there, but we didn’t get a chance to use it).  The hosts responded to questions/inquiries quickly and were very  helpful and accommodating.<br/>Great choice for us.  Thank you."

39969910,718457751,2020-12-26,306390860,Mj,places is great!! fantastic views and super clean!! I just recommend always parking your car in the garage or in front of the garage because they do have issues with people stealing things out of cars on the street. all in all though I would definitely recommend this to someone else as a great place to stay if you're looking for a nice place in Salem!!!!

It was very clean and had everything we needed for our stay, including pots, utensils, basic cooking spices, coffee pot and coffee, sugar, etc. Having a washer and dryer was an added bonus especially since we were there a full week. The king-size bed was comfortable, there were plenty of towels, and shampoo and conditioner as well as a blow dryer were provided.

There is an amazing view of the river that is a 5 minute walk from the house.<br/>The house itself is perfect! The living room is cosy yet spacious, with an amazing fireplace and a very comfortable couch. The bedroom is also very spacious with lots of closet space. The kitchen is fully equipped with everything we needed and then some! The laundry room was so handy and easy to use, and the garage was just perfect. But above all that, what really shined through is Judy's and Faddy's generosity and kindness! Rarely do you have the privilege to be met by such genuine warm-heartedness as we have experienced from our lovely hosts. I would recommend anybody travelling to the area to grab this lovely airbnb if you get the chance. It is simply PERFECT! Hope (and plan) to come back next year and stay at this lovely airbnb!"

One of the pluses of staying there was access to a private garage. The backyard is very small, maybe 10 x 20 ft, fenced, but shared with the other neighbor in the duplex. I took several walks around the neighborhood and walked a few blocks to Bush's Pasture Park. Lots of shopping and eating along Commercial St. and Liberty St. Riverfront Park is just a short drive away.<br/>Wine country is just west of Salem and is worth seeing."

The home felt like a family members, filled with all your necessities, like a cozy broken-in and fluffy leather couch, hard candies in baskets and cozy blankets.

40070743,721752477,2021-01-03,381404640,Jessica,Such a beautiful home. Me and my family were very comfortable during our stay. The rooms are great sizes and the bathroom was nice. Tim and Lisa are both great hosts! I was in town for my grandfathers funeral and they sent us a beautiful plant with a sweet note. It brought a smile to the entire family. Such a small gesture but meant a lot to us. Would definitely stay again. 10/10 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
40070743,731374034,2021-02-14,174327172,Jenna,"While our stay had to be cancelled last minute due to an unforeseen snow storm, Tim and Lisa went out of their way to make sure we received a full refund and even called customer support on our behalf. I look forward to staying with them in the future."
40070743,750649381,2021-04-20,107779365,Ashley,"Tim and Lisa’s home is a hidden gem! They are the sweetest host and responded to us very quickly. The house was so cute and clean! I loved having coffee on the swing on the front porch and even had a little fire pit in the yard for s’mores. Shower pressure and temperature were amazing if that’s something that is important to you! They have everything you need and more in their home! They went above and beyond to make sure we felt as comfortable as possible! Their home was a home away from home as a travel RN. It was the perfect long stay, even offered to have the house cleaned. During this pandemic and so much uncertainty we’re extremely grateful to have found Tim and Lisa’s home. Thank you both again!"
40070743,754349889,2021-05-02,340118960,Paula,The backyard is perfect for relaxing with the family
40070743,756182848,2021-05-08,279977938,Elizabeth,"Great place to stay - clean and comfortable. Definitely appreciated having kitchen, laundry and a backyard. Hosts were very prompt and clear in communication. Be aware that the stairs to the second floor can be a little difficult, even for an able-bodied person."
40070743,757340728,2021-05-11,297690075,Adriana,"Less then 10hour notice and there place was all ready for me and my teenagers to occupy,had no problem with anything, second floor steps are steep but are manageable using rail ..There’s a little cove with a Tv probably for little ones but I enjoyed the experience of being in there watching a movie thanks Tim/Lisa this house will be on my list of places to stay the next time I come to visit hopefully on better circumstances …Peace and love lots of hugs ..Adriana"
40070743,759343932,2021-05-16,151153762,Leslie,"A really nice stay in Salem! Plenty of room, great location, everything you need in the kitchen, comfortable beds and a nice outdoor patio. Working WiFi and laundry machines. We wished for more than a blanket on the bed and a working ice maker but were happy with the value and enough space for our whole family to be very comfortable. We will stay here again!"

I was pleased with the amount of space the house had to offer along with its location. Very clean with a cute front porch with a bench swing along with a nice back deck. Would book again!
40070743,444923513007209013,2021-09-05,325417933,Michaela,"This was a great spot for 4 of us to come rest at during our trip.

40070743,475348484207429190,2021-10-17,20903631,Jenn,Nice and clean little rental. It’s got a fair bit of road noise that we did not anticipate from the photos . The stairs are very steep and not great for people who are challenged with stairs. The beds and linens were comfy and nice .  You have to back out onto a fairly busy street to get out of the drive. Overall it was a nice experience .
40070743,480430470435916788,2021-10-24,232176733,Jeff,"Well appointed home with accurate listing. Noisy street for upstairs so difficult sleep if that bothers you.  Very clean and comfortable otherwise with a good kitchen for cooking. Nice touches with seasonings, coffee and bottled water left for us. Centrally located.   Worked well for 6 adults."
40070743,483362788605908414,2021-10-28,425667756,Breanna,"What a relaxing stay,Tim and Lisa thought about everything you could need."

40070743,505175882592539882,2021-11-27,230435296,Diane,"We found Tim and Lisa’s home to be perfect for our family to be together for thanksgiving this year! The house was so cozy and clean. The linens and towels were high quality. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook a feast, and the large table was perfect for serving our family of 5+ our dad who lives in Salem. Tim and Lisa were awesome hosts!"
40070743,516018812632102373,2021-12-12,115733142,Clint,Awesome stay! Thanks so much!
40070743,521042516300711443,2021-12-19,24497987,Daniel,"Everything was very well labeled and just as described. I think my other half may have greeted the hosts early during our stay, but the place was quiet and cozy and the beds were very comfortable and clean. Thanks for the stay!"

40070743,602228977425708976,2022-04-10,244551050,Ginger,"Great stay; nice, clean.  Be prepared to cover train and traffic sounds for sleep. Box fans are provided and will work to provide white noise, or bring your noise canceling earbuds."
40070743,608080162302287994,2022-04-18,213720795,Pauline,This home was everything you saw in the pictures and more!! Comfy and coast I loved the memories that we made as a family there. I was really impressed with how well everything was set up and how clean the space was.
40070743,612332924718985535,2022-04-24,168477801,Jacob,Great well kept house in a central location.

40070743,617478189770583538,2022-05-01,31044052,Jackie,"Large, very clean home with nice deck spaces. Great value. The house is on a busy road and near an intersection and the train that runs through Salem, so the road and train noise is noticeable and might impact lighter sleepers. We found a sound machine or earplugs helpful."
40070743,622507379646153721,2022-05-08,453231100,Ryan,A great clean house!
40070743,626105978739553179,2022-05-13,410469849,Dianna,Very clean and great location
40070743,635557856711193332,2022-05-26,428313213,Ashley,"The place is cozy, it feels homey, and is suitable for a small family. As far as i could tell, it felt safe <br/>on the poperty but it is shared between a basement tenant and like a guest house tenant. That was a little surprising, but they seemed like kind people. I recommend the place but as far as i could tell there was no A.C. so fans are a necessity. The owners have supplied some fans but they aren't the best so be mindful of that. I have to say, overall this was a good stay, and there us a really cute community cat named Joe  and i really wish i could have pet him but we kept missing each other."
40070743,642778779090362435,2022-06-05,457633738,Carly,"This place was great for our weekend in Oregon! We were visiting Salem to explore different areas we are interested in moving to from out of state, and we were so happy to find this home. You are right next to a neighbor who is in a connected building and two who live below the house in the basement, but we didn’t hear a peep from either and the only interaction we did have was a really pleasant conversation. Lisa was very responsive to messages and accommodating for our early check in and late checkout! There was awesome outdoor spots around the whole house;  back deck, front porch, and side porch. Perfect internet connection, and even a Netflix account you can use! The master bed is really really firm, but huge and peaceful. The kitchen had all the essentials and a bunch of spices to use. We loved loved using the grill on the deck and sitting out there… which is where we met the BEST PART of the home… Joe the cat!! He was the sweetest boy and we spent a lot of time snuggling him and holding him like a baby. Overall, if you just need a private comfortable place to stay in Salem, this is it."
40070743,651508391042118238,2022-06-17,431302241,Jacob,Great experience staying at their home
40070743,652951614891766372,2022-06-19,7021288,Alisha,"Clean place with good size rooms. Easy check-in and check-out process. All of the basic cooking ingredients are included, with lots of pots and pans. Outdoor space is nice and there is a great cat outside. Please note that the ceiling above the stairs are bit short and we had some folks accidentally walk into it."
40070743,658049281261859684,2022-06-26,111652778,Kaitlin,Perfect place to stay while visiting for my sisters baby shower.
40070743,660172922291255907,2022-06-29,64563692,Heather,"Wonderful home to stay at! Comfortable beds, well stocked kitchen, all of the things that you need to feel at home! We really enjoyed all of the personal touches and details, and the hosts were incredibly accommodating when we booked on *very* short notice."
40070743,664588731579052123,2022-07-05,457521819,Karina,"Es un espacio acogedor , te sientes completamente en casa muy cómodo y con todo lo que necesario para una buena estadía"

40070743,679113854377493452,2022-07-25,74017605,Jorge,Tim and Lisa’s place is great. They are very nice people and the Communication between us was great… If we’re ever back in the Salem area. We will book with Tim and Lisa.
40070743,681176017429653288,2022-07-28,471038139,Martin,Beautiful big house.<br/>Well furnished<br/>I’m not sure it’s a safety neighborhood to walk the evening.
40070743,697844828168855416,2022-08-20,108198429,Hector,Really nice and clean spot!
40070743,708731730661719848,2022-09-04,332826595,Mandy,Highly recommend Kkoki Korean BBQ place near by. The rental had some sketchy areas near by but the rental itself was good and felt safe. <br/>We were able to walk to the state fair from the house so the location was great for that. <br/>The shower was smaller than what the ad stated and the water pressure was lacking but everything was very clean. <br/>I was a bit put off by the paper requesting tips by the beds as the housekeeping service payment is added to the air bnb cost. <br/>The kitchen was stocked well and the ice machine/water machine was a nice touch. <br/>We also like the small TV nook upstairs. <br/>Over all the place was nice
40070743,713787400103168373,2022-09-11,258778916,Marissa,"This was such a wonderful stay. My family & I truly felt comfortable. Everything about Tim/Lisa’s home was accurate. My main concern when I book a place is cleanliness but this home was spotless & felt so fresh, which made it so much easier to relax. <br/><br/>We loved the porch & swing. <br/>This was a nice short visit & I highly recommend. It was the perfect amount of space for 5 people & the hosts were very easy to communicate with. <br/><br/>I would say parking is not the best but that’s understandable. <br/>Overall great stay & I would book again when staying in Salem."
40070743,725399955489623093,2022-09-27,464925714,Wendy,Great house and great location. Live craftsmen style houses and it did not disappoint.
40070743,728319929359039480,2022-10-01,78436777,Alesia,"Tim/Lisa’s home was clean, not far from the freeway, and had all of the accommodations my family needed to feel some sense of comfort during our uncomfortable trip to OR."
40070743,735601579966319318,2022-10-11,165735039,Megan,"We'd stay here again! Great hosts and clean, nice place."

40070743,792143846032432760,2022-12-28,376889055,Karyl,"We stayed at Tim and Lisa's over the Christmas holiday as there were too many people at our in-laws.  Even though we basically used it as our crash pad, the house was lovely.  It was clean and quiet.  A perfect getaway from the craziness of our holiday family crowd.  Tim and Lisa were quick and responsive to our communications and we truly appreciated being able to stay there."
40070743,831999685247050295,2023-02-21,470472085,Jauna,Cute and cozy home.

40070743,840714654159640834,2023-03-05,276393000,James,We had a great stay at Tim’s house. Had no issues. Spacious with lots of kitchen ware. We will definitely be using this Airbnb again when inviting family.
40070743,845750544522242812,2023-03-12,63093175,Cat,Great to find a three bedroom one bath place in Salem. EV charger works (if you ask the host to tell someone on the property to turn it on) which was really why I selected this place. Nice to have a kitchen for our stay. Bedrooms upstairs are a little dicey for tall adults but I imagine perfect for children. Only two car parking locations and some fun turning around in the driveway but everyone in Salem is so sweet!
40070743,850806724616231205,2023-03-19,368798765,Linda,Place had everything we needed and more. We had a pleasant stay and wouldn’t mind booking again in the future.
40861468,598261093,2020-01-26,68259491,Erin,"Great place! MUCH bigger than we expected! We didn’t see it during daylight, but it looks like it has a great yard and big windows that would let in lots of light. Has everything you need - the one quirk (which she says in the listing) is the bathroom sink is the only sink. Not a problem for us - easy to do the few dishes we used. Better than a hotel for less!"
40861468,606838176,2020-02-16,73862168,Jeff,"Cassi has a great place, it's much more spacious than it appears in the pictures. There is a large backyard that our dog thoroughly enjoyed running around in, and the kitchen is well stocked with everything you need to make a small meal. Cassi was great about responding quickly, and accommodated our group of 4. There's a huge river park nearby that we ran down to that was really nice."
40861468,738384082,2021-03-12,32871161,Becca,"What a great place! Lots of room, sparkling clean, and a comfortable bed. It was a perfect location for us as we enjoyed the ~1.5 mile walk to downtown Salem through the park and surrounding neighborhoods. Fantastic value for the amount of space and number of beds available. Very quiet neighborhood. Our dog Betty slept comfortably and enjoyed the little lawn outside. Will save location for future visits to the area and definitely recommend to friends & family."
40861468,741160602,2021-03-21,8940391,Sara Lura,"This was a great place to stay. Beautiful neighborhood, centrally located. It is a walk out basement with many windows so you don't feel like you're in a basement at all. It was very bright and spacious."
40861468,761724249,2021-05-23,6582377,Andrea,"Our stay at the Bombshell Basement ahead of the Willamette Valley Marathon was fantastic, thanks to all the kindness and flexibility of our host, Cassi. She let us check in early and shower after the race. The space was HUGE and perfect for 3 girlfriends -- we each had our own little nook and privacy. I have mobility issues (I use a walker to get around), but going through the grass was fine and perfect once inside. Also, the bed was soooooo comfortable!!!"

40861468,414508550118377374,2021-07-25,2515067,Juliet,"Cassi's place was great! Much bigger than the pictures suggest, immaculately clean and the bed was so comfy. There's a second bed - a twin - which is great for a second person if you won't want to share a bed. We stayed here for a triathlon and it was quiet and cool and the perfect place to put our feet up before the race.  And Cassi was super generous about check in and check out time so we could shower afterwards. Thanks so much Cassi!"
40861468,439825466480649882,2021-08-29,258434921,Paula,"This unit is in a beautiful neighborhood.  There are big windows looking out onto a large patio.  Good location for shopping nearby, and we enjoyed driving the scenic farmland areas around Salem."

This is essentially a full apartment with WAY more room than you will expect in a great residential area on a hill above the river valley.  Great walks for the dog and the kid that drove up from OSU to meet me for Thanksgiving.  Mere minutes to stores and restaurants - don’t think twice!"

There were lots of thoughtful amenities (great coffee, filtered water, extra blankets and pillows, as well as a rack for hanging clothes) and they were so friendly and helpful as I got settled in my new location. If you're visiting Salem, or have friends or family coming to stay, I highly recommend Englewood Loft-- it's quiet, in a great location and hosted by wonderful people!"

Comfortable space tucked up in among beautiful leafy trees, great kitchen, awesome cold water jugs in the fridge, and very convenient for Salem government travel. Wonderful hosts. I loved that they had a few books out to read, because with all the libraries & book shops being closed right now, I really miss books. That said, a tiny night light near the bed would make it even more awesome! :)"

The place was exceptionally clean and they do a great job of making it a very welcoming space. It was extremely comfortable and little things like an awesome shower made for a very relaxing stay. The chickens are awesome. They won't bother you at all and it's neat to have them. One morning they were sitting at the bottom of the steps just waiting to say hello. But they will simply walk away and leave you alone. Definitely don't shy away if that is of any concern. It's a really nice, clean space and the hosts are great people as well."

This was truly a home away from home and Heather and husband Nick made us feel like royalty. Nothing was to big an ask and we are sad to be leaving. The 4 resident chickens were the icing on the cake. Highly, highly recommend if you want a true Salem experience. Lovely place, great neighborhood and amazing hosts."

I was there in the fall, more of the chilly time of year, and I can’t even begin to tell you how comfy and warm I was up in this cute studio loft! It had everything I needed for my 10 day stay while visiting family while I was in town. A fully stocked kitchen where I cooked dinner almost every night. I loved having a washer and dryer too, to get caught up on my laundry as well. The bed was so comfortable, and the studio was so quiet, it was perfect to get a great nights sleep, every night!  The only sounds I heard where the residents cute chickens clucking outside which I looked forward to greeting me every day when I came back to the studio. I love the Coffee selection provided for you , and I looked forward to making a new selection every day! There was so many extra touches throughout the studio to make you feel right at home. It was so clean and neat, and looked brand new! Heather and Nick are such great hosts, and were always so quick to respond and help with everything I needed during my stay! This wonderful loft is better than any hotel in Salem, I hope it’s available on every visit I have next time I’m in town! Thank you again for making my visit with my family so wonderful!"

41338909,405760330759872026,2021-07-13,389202788,Nita,"Heather and Nick have thought of everything.  It is easy to find and you have your own parking space off the street.  We had all information on how to enter and our door code sent to us prior to our arrival.  We arrived after a ridiculous day of travel with no luggage to find a sweet note with my husband’s favorite candy and the loft was clean and simply adorable.  We were so happy to see the washer and dryer so we could have clean clothes in the morning.  <br/>I texted Heather to let her know we were expecting our luggage to be delivered and they were so helpful keeping and eye out for the delivery.  We truly enjoyed our stay and will be back if they will have us, the location is perfect for us."
41338909,410186916607141768,2021-07-19,278378397,Deborah,"What an adorable and comfortable place the Englewood Loft is!  Nestled in a quaint Northeast neighborhood that is exceptionally quiet, we were within minutes of everywhere we needed to go.  The loft is well appointed with everything you might need (or forget) and you might even be gifted with fresh eggs from the resident hens Maple, Willow, Aspen, Junie, Clover & Fern!   Having endured many consecutive and smoke-filled days over 100* in Idaho, we were delighted to be able to open the loft windows and enjoy the cool breezes that arrive in the late evenings.  My favorite thing first thing in the mornings was to sit at an open window with my cup of coffee, look out upon the beautiful neighborhood and listen to the hens clucking and trilling as they foraged in the yard.  I can't say enough about how sweet Heather is and we so enjoyed getting to know her!  Even though Heather and Nick live below the Loft, you have complete privacy above.  Wanna get away?  Come stay at the peaceful  Englewood Loft and restore your soul!  ❣"

Checking in and out was incredibly simple and I loved the location. It feels like you are in the suburbs but you are only a few blocks from the main roads. It was the best Airbnb experience I have ever had! Would highly recommend it!

41338909,526147076333099484,2021-12-26,41589011,Andrew,"Englewood Loft was the perfect cozy escape from the hectic parts of the holidays. I needed a space to retreat to between family gatherings, and it fit the bill nicely. The unit has all the amenities for some quiet living: kitchen, washer, dryer, and an awesome hot shower. The heating was able to keep up easily with the winter cold, and I could sit and play some video games during my downtime. A highlight of my comings and goings was getting to say hello and goodbye to Heather's chickens that I would occasionally pass by as they coo'd about the back yard. As you're coming and going, know that it's a little muddy (at least in rainy winter) and there's two gates. Would recommend trying to have at least one hand free and be cautious with any dress shoes. My host, Heather, was exceptionally friendly, kind, and responsive. I would whole heartedly recommend staying with Heather at Englewood Loft."
41338909,546472913337804062,2022-01-23,146813771,Adam,"As comfortable as being home, super clean, and with thoughtful touches of hospitality throughout - a user friendly door code, a welcome of chocolates and fresh eggs, guest-mode Roku TV to access our streaming accounts, a wonderful collection of teas and coffee. Not to mention a fully appointed kitchen, large bathroom, washer and dryer with supplies, and off-street parking. Heather and Nick are doing it right, and from the heart. Didn’t get to meet Nick, but Heather is as sweet as she can be. We told her we might have our son over for a meal or two, and when we checked in lo and behold, an extra chair and the table set for three. We have found THE place to stay when we visit Salem! Thanks Heather and Nick – it was the best Airbnb experience we have had."

We were in town visiting family and it was the perfect location for us to be close to everyone and everything.  Heather and Nick were excellent hosts.  The communication was prompt and thorough, and the loft itself was warm, inviting and comfortable.  We had everything we need, and then some, including a bowl of fresh eggs.

This air b& b was clean, quiet, accommodating and very, very, comfortable. My husband & I took walks in the neighborhood nearly every day & felt completely safe. We had our own parking space and you can just tell that the hosts have put a lot of time into thinking  about what their guests might need or want. We will hopefully get to stay here again at another trip up to visit relatives. Thank you both so much!"

Heather was easy to communicate with and a very nice woman!  It was delightful to see the five healthy and happy chickens in the backyard when I left each morning.  The Englewood apartment is a great place to stay when visiting Salem!
41338909,738441259278302023,2022-10-15,5893759,Timothy,Very comfortable space. Heather did a great job taking care of all the details to ensure of a welcome stay. Thank you for opening your home to me. I loved it!
41338909,749401383526026687,2022-10-30,170477018,Miranda,"Heather's place was really cool and super cozy. It was pretty private, I rarely saw anyone when I was entering and exiting the location. I often saw their chickens in the yard during the day and it was really easy to get in/out of the yard without disturbing them. The place was fully stocked with an assortment of coffee flavors and they kindly provided some eggs fresh from their chickens! They also provided laundry detergent and dryer sheets which was great because I needed to do laundry during my stay. I would really recommend staying here especially if you plan to spend time downtown."
41338909,760982553841060581,2022-11-15,388115219,Lauren,"The loft is a perfect place to stay while in Salem. Within walking distance to downtown and the capital, it was perfect for our long weekend in Oregon. Heather even offered to let us meet their foster kittens (which I so wish we had taken her up on the offer)! It is so cozy and comfortable - plus it has a full kitchen and washer dryer so it can really be a home away from home. Will definitely look to stay here again next time we come to Salem! Thank you Heather and Nick!!"
41338909,768243592377391932,2022-11-25,8616310,Michelle,Beautiful spot with all the amenities. Wonderful host. I had to leave early due to some medical problems but the host was very gracious about my need to shorten my stay. I recommend the place to anyone.

42243993,624767569,2020-05-14,1865205,Alana,Simple place with everything we needed! Enjoyed the river view and the Roku TV. Nice hot shower and plenty of space.
42243993,625634426,2020-05-22,189689490,Jeff,"First off... The negatives. Calling it a condo is a bit misleading. It's a unit in an apartment complex near a homeless hub. There was a homeless guy just outside the parking lot sleeping on an old couch. The internet didn't work for us in any of the bedrooms or the master bathroom. Had to use devices only in the living room. With that out of the way.... The inside is nice, clean and stylish. The glass doors leading to the balcony drown out the sound of the creek in the back if you don't want to hear it but also allow you to take it in when you're ready for it. Very clean and located close to a McDonald's and Safeway as well as the downtown mall even though that was closed. Body and hair care products were provided and felt nice. Lots of towels were on hand. Overall... I enjoyed my stay and the communication was second to none. Would recommend"
42243993,626011782,2020-05-24,56986160,Nikki,"Amanda's place was perfect for our weekend stay, will definitely book her spot again"

42243993,631693223,2020-06-23,119859538,Elfia,"Great big space and very clean! Looks like it has been recently renovated. Having curtains inside the room will greatly help block out the early morning sun during summer. Out of our 3 days stay, we heard a train passed by and it made a lot of noise but overall, we are happy we found this place and hoping to come back again in the future..."
42243993,633875657,2020-07-01,92582966,Jessica,Beautiful home perfect for the night and lovely view.

My favorite little extra  was the Mini Blue Bunny Ice Cream Cones that we’re in the freezer. Great great touch. Our host was a great communicator. This will be the only place i book going forward when i go to Salem. Just a great place!!"
42243993,637920444,2020-07-13,271402635,Swanna,This place is a perfect stay! My friends and I came across this place after taking a spontaneous adventure and decided to find a stay quite quickly.

42243993,661319865,2020-09-06,311673580,Emily,"Super cute updated apartment. A really great space and cute balcony with a view of the creek. Amanda provided tons of information and tips for the trip. The location is very close to down town which is super convenient, she is very honest about the cons of the location. I didn’t find it to be any worse than staying in another cities downtown area. <br/>My one problem about the apartment was the very strong smell of cigarette smoke in the house.<br/>Even with that being said I would still recommend this Airbnb."

42243993,671653262,2020-10-05,101726895,Roselyn,Stopped off here for a night on our way to Astoria. We arrived late and left early so I can’t really speak to the location but we found the apartment to be clean spacious and comfortable.  The outside of the building is a little run down but don’t let that put  you off because inside the apartment is really nice. If we had had more time I would have enjoyed coffee on the balcony by the creek this morning.

Would definitely stay here again when visiting the willamette valley."

42243993,740692152,2021-03-20,225615760,Patricia,"We had a short notice trip to check out Oregon colleges as daughter received word of scholarship awards. Grandparents really wanted to come too. And then there is COVID. Our second floor apartment was ever so clean and cozy and had everything we needed to eat in and was perfectly located to pick up all the great local food from downtown. You can walk to the capital and shops. Beautiful view of creek from deck. Complex was quiet and kind. It was a wonderful stay and this little home made the trip fun, easy, way affordable to hotels. Beds are comfy. So much fun to be in a neighborhood so close to so much!!!"

42243993,750927740,2021-04-22,134138767,Jessica,Amanda’s condo is not a condo but a very old apartment building. Across the street is a homeless center. There are people sleeping on the sidewalks. If you want to walk to the store or downtown you have to walk through that. Once inside the apartment it is really nice and clean with a private patio that overlooks a creek. The rooms are good size  with comfortable beds.

42243993,395724615523989332,2021-06-29,408852005,Akiko,"Rooms were immaculate, the host responded very quickly. Only one downside was that they didn’t have central AC, so they use fans to send cool air from small AC from master bedroom. We stayed there on one of the hottest days in Salem. Especially kitchen got very hot and we were sweating until the cool breeze came in and cooled down the rooms. The creek nearby was very soothing."

We enjoyed walking around in the area. it's close to a variety of restaurants & a movie theater. Great jump off point for touring near by environs..

42243993,429701581917833460,2021-08-15,36900146,Marissa,"The place is stylish, cute, and comfy. Window unit ACs kept the place nice and cool. We were only here one night but worked well for two couples. Like others have mentioned, its proximity to downtown is both good and bad--convenient location, but there are homeless people nearby."
42243993,433343506823389958,2021-08-20,89599807,Tina,Amanda was incredibly responsive and easy to work with.

Her communication is superb, and her directions are very comprehensive. The cleanliness and sufficiency of house equipments cannot be overemphasized. Nice sit out at the back viewing the lake. Awesome experience indeed! I would truly recommend her for your future vacation stay."

The shampoo and conditioner smelled so good. Plenty of towels and linen. The kitchen was super clean. Well stocked with everything to cook. The creek water running is such a bonus. You will feel like you’re in a spa. The location is literally 1 block away from downtown which is convenient for shopping and dinning. The neighbors are super quiet. It feels like you’re all alone which is nice. Reserved parking was great too. I would recommend this place 1000%.
42243993,459499542641825411,2021-09-25,379978452,Lakshmi,"Very clean and spacious apartment. Outside the apartment complex can look dated and a little spooky, but inside the apartment is top-notch. Very happy with our stay."

42243993,519624841963862726,2021-12-17,55341471,Nancy,As other reviewers have said this apartment is even nicer than the photos. It is tastefully decorated and has many extra little touches that made me feel welcome and well-cared for. Amanda is very responsive. Some of my favorite features: It’s on a quiet street without a lot of traffic but is convenient to downtown; the dedicated parking spot; the comfortable bed; the balcony that looks out over Mill Creek. I only wish I had found this place sooner as I have made several trips to Salem over the last few years and have never had as nice a place to stay as this apartment.
42243993,521845998243258019,2021-12-20,22014984,Santiago,"Amanda's place had everything we needed (as shown in the description) and she was super responsive whenever we had questions.

42243993,533458336911038794,2022-01-05,356999250,Connie,Never stayed at a place that had such a full stocked kitchen. Loved the beds and pillows.  Nothing like being four blocks from town and listening to mill creek rushing by at night.   Great place to stay
42243993,542055501674106422,2022-01-17,288233963,Kristi,"This place worked very well for us. The location is great, and I LOVED having the sound and beauty of the river close by.<br/>I can't think of anything I would add. There were towels galore, plenty of cookware, utensils, toiletries, etc. Games and movies, books, plenty of seating. The bed was the most comfortable I've slept in for YEARS--gonna miss that!<br/>The baseboard heaters keep things nice and cozy (stayed in January), but could be hazardous if you have little ones I suppose.<br/>The neighborhood was quiet, and the parking spot was convenient. Finding an on-street parking spot wasn't too difficult, but good to know that parking is limited to 90 minutes during business hours on weekdays.<br/>I would stay here again in a heartbeat--thank you, Amanda!"
42243993,545779868327202698,2022-01-22,441538244,Amanda,"Really nice apartment. 2 bathrooms, balcony and view of the river. Nice appliances and free parking. Cant go wrong. Great deal."

42243993,559547918223032300,2022-02-10,5556372,Catherine,"This is a full 2 bathroom, 2 bath apartment with lots of space to spread out and relax.  I was on a work trip for a conference at the Convention Center and made a point of walking rather than driving over to the space... was just under a 30 minute walk and a great way to get some fresh air.  I really enjoyed the creek sounds out the back patio and main bedroom.  Thank you for the perfect home away from home!"
42243993,562391222728459245,2022-02-14,219657288,Charlie,The place was exactly as described! My mom and I stayed for a couple nights and enjoyed each having our own bedroom and bathroom.

I suggested to the host that they add an air filter, as the building is older, and someone with allergies might have issues. I would stay here again, as it was a lovely place to relax after visiting local family."
42243993,652926590281905846,2022-06-19,32206898,Charlotte,Our wedding guests stayed here for my wedding weekend. I rented 4 apartments in the complex from Amanda to host them. All of were happy!

42243993,673244221285890276,2022-07-17,154906055,Corina,"This is an older apartment complex that is very well taken care of. The unit was very clean and comfortable. Outside on the back deck you can hear the running creek which is so relaxing. We felt safe behind closed doors. The hostess was clear with her communication. One other comment I read mentioned the homeless issue nearby. I pretty much understand it is out of the owners control, but it is quite off putting just two blocks away in about every direction. We were not bothered by the folks, but the mess they leave is ugly and we were concerned about our vehicles although nothing bad happened."
42243993,673962591732518125,2022-07-18,67846929,Komal,"Great cozy place to stay. very comfortable. Amanda was very responsive,  loved the calm sound of the creek flowing behind."

It is very clean, located in a convenient location (downtown right next to the capitol), and the host is GREAT at communicating. we stayed with our pet and there was only a small extra fee of $15. If we weren't just passing through we would def stay again!"
42243993,686281285165153536,2022-08-04,7757256,Betsy,"A large, well-appointed apartment with an incredible balcony overlooking Mill Creek — very peaceful evening perch. The neighborhood is convenient to downtown Salem, which served us well but also requires the caveat that the city’s meth heads are just beyond the doorstep (or were on our visit). V normal problem for all of us on the West Coast but I absolutely would not walk to evening outings or meals. We had zero problems, but it’s worth noting that if that kind of thing alarms you, you might want to seek a spot farther from downtown."

42243993,691421572173363189,2022-08-11,177156535,Emily,"We really enjoyed our stay at Amanda’s place. It was a perfect place for our crew to stay in Salem and allowed my brother to get acquainted with his new city for the year. One thing that took us a little by surprise was some homeless encampment taking place right outside of the complex. We had no issues but it was a bit surprising when we pulled in after midnight. All that said, we would definitely stay there again."

As we were dropping kid at college we didn’t have time to ask her about the drain while we were there.

The space has everything you need to enjoy a getaway weekend, or have a home base in Salem as you explore. The small details are what made this fantastic. From extra blankets, to spare feminine products, this place makes you feel like you are at home. The view from the deck overlooking Mill Creek was great for a morning coffee break. Overall, this is a great place. I wish I could have stayed longer!"

42243993,772561789633198134,2022-12-01,488864564,Kimberley,"I love how pets are welcome, next time I would love to bring them. I like how there’s no carpet except for a beautiful simple rug in the living room.  Butterfly 🦋 picture is adorable along with a lama picture on the door which I adore lamas or alpacas 😁. <br/>The creek in the back was soothing to hear. And the most important is the neighbors really didn’t hear anything at all nice locations I would recommend and be back soon!"

42243993,778381916138105101,2022-12-09,133451070,Katy,"Enjoyed my stay while working at the Capitol building.  As a bonus, I was able to walk to work and avoid paying parking in the blocks around the Capitol.  Instructions were very clear and detailed.   The space was very comfortable and clean.  I appreciated the sound of the creek out the back patio and enjoyed that view very much.  I will absolutely be staying here again."
42243993,780594101422891411,2022-12-12,404423416,Denise,"The place was nice. About what you’d pay for a hotel. We liked having 2 bathrooms and separate bedrooms for the price. <br/><br/>There were many broken spots on the blinds that let a lot of light through.<br/><br/>It’s downtown Salem and you might be safe, but we heard tons of noise and there were homeless people digging in the trash everyday.<br/><br/>Host was very responsive with any issues that came up."
42243993,785643097389944785,2022-12-19,29581645,Lucinda And Jerry,The apartment was so nice.  It is right on the Millcreek very close to downtown and the capital.

The apartment is centrally located in downtown Salem and you can get to many great restaurants and shopping by walking a few blocks. We were staying here while looking for a house after I relocated here for a new job. The rates were very reasonable and the apartment was large enough that we felt we had plenty of space. There is also a deck in the back that overlooks a large creek. If you are staying in Salem this a great choice to stay.
42243993,818922892015214466,2023-02-03,255844646,Joshua,Great place. Great communication. Really loved it. <br/><br/>Only quibble - the shower wasn’t clean. It could use some bleach….

42243993,830589310858035606,2023-02-19,105280257,Michelle,We loved our stay! Thank you Amanda for being so responsive. We loved how walkable the space was to a lot of local restaurants and breweries. The space was big enough and appropriate for our dog! Thanks so much! :)
42243993,835620053058702283,2023-02-26,65765284,Kelly K,Wonderful and responsive hostess. Very clean accomodations located in downtown Salem. Super convenient for restaurants and our destination. The bed is very comfy and the sound of the creek is just the perfect white noise. We felt lucky to find this place!
42243993,840670198448795829,2023-03-05,421437461,Stephanie,"Location is a little sketch, but that is warned about, and its a great deal for a week stay. Comfortable, very spacious, loved the patio and large windows."
42243993,846488799354590226,2023-03-13,118441929,Ann,"Amanda is a responsive and helpful host.

The area is a little ""run down"", but that has nothing to do with the unit, just Salem in general. No safety issues, it was quiet and suited our purposes well. The provided ground coffee was appreciated!"

42472856,765948817,2021-06-03,75275749,Nicole,"I had a lovely time at Jennifer's place! It provided just what I needed for my clinicals at Salem Health! Very clean, tons of storage space in the kitchen, fridge, and bathroom, and very private despite sharing the home with others. Jennifer was so welcoming and communicative, her son is super cute, and the dogs are very friendly once they get used to you! I walked to and from the hospital in 15 minutes which was a huge bonus. I'm looking forward to staying here again the next time I visit Salem! Thanks Jennifer!"
42472856,390552206252694631,2021-06-22,75275749,Nicole,"The best of the best! Private room, easy check in, kitchen access, and basically a bathroom to yourself. Thanks Jennifer!"

42472856,401518447157553180,2021-07-07,172731544,Mary,Very comfortable bed. Very quaint old house. Jennifer was very nice and accommodating. There were two dogs and puppies on the premises. This was not a problem for me as I love dogs!<br/>The AC unit in the bedroom blows very cold air. It felt good.
42472856,402902150248979653,2021-07-09,42720195,Michael,"Jennifer was an excellent host! She communicated well and answered any questions I had promptly during our stay. She was very polite, had great energy and offered us great recommendations for our travels. The entire place was extra clean and organized. Jennifer even let us hold her two week old baby puppies which made our day! The Internet is super fast might I add!"
42472856,413843342442715133,2021-07-24,613208,Gina,Great hosts! Cute kid and dogs. Nice having the bathroom pretty much to myself. I hope to see you all again sometime (:
42472856,415186334551191507,2021-07-26,149162884,Tim,"It was a comfortable room. I liked the code lock to the bedroom. It has AC, but the ceiling fan is enough to keep cool at night. Everything is labeled nicely, so there is no confusion. Would recommend."
42472856,419568988871722580,2021-08-01,130048619,Jenny,"Jennifer was extremely friendly and communicative. Check-in was a breeze, and Jennifer met me outside when I arrived for a house tour. The bed was super comfy, and the room had an AC (it was 100° outside when I was there). The place is right next to Bush Park, and I enjoyed walking through the park to downtown (~20 minutes) during my stay. Highly recommended!"
42472856,428313902692150810,2021-08-13,165406375,Delaney,"Jennifer’s hospitality truly made this a home away from home. The house was cozy, clean, and in a great location. Great price for a full kitchen, everything you could possibly need, big bathroom, etc. I spent two weeks working remotely, perfect desk space in the room and never had an issue with WiFi."
42472856,433362632573346833,2021-08-20,217133674,Craig,Great place to rest! The space is super cozy and clean and the hosts are amazing! I Would stay here anytime :)
42472856,434754705506852973,2021-08-22,24562754,Rhonda,"The house was fairly close to downtown, so the location nice; however, the neighborhood seemed a bit sketchy to me.  It wasn't the fault of the host but the next door neighbors were getting ready for a yard sale and, evidently in a fight, so I had to listen to a lot of fighting and swearing and loud people. The house layout is nice for privacy but the walls are very thin, and people/kids were up and running around by 6:00 in the mornings.  I was provided with the door code but no other information on the home which made my stay very uncomfortable."
42472856,437682488208531678,2021-08-26,172162279,Nikka,"Jennifer and her husband were very friendly and welcoming. The location was perfect for my job and close driving distance to many stores, restaurants, etc. <br/>There was always parking on the street out front and it felt very private even though others are living in the house. Jennifer was very honest in regards to possible noise from her dogs and child but the noise was very minimal and did not affect my stay.  The neighbor’s dog was noisy at times. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would definitely come back. Thank you!"
42472856,446403520922487035,2021-09-07,244813824,Anna & James,"Very clean, great price and perfect for my two week stay. They were friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again."

42796228,661321201,2020-09-06,221290899,Andrea,"Matthew is such an amazing host! Words can’t express how quick to respond and kind he was to us when we had to evacuate home during the Californian-fires of 2020. We had ended up in a Portland location we weren’t comfortable in and found Matthew’s place after searching for a place that felt much safer and Matthew was quick to help us out.<br/><br/>He called and we told him the situation, then he quickly helped us book an earlier time in the Airbnb app and made sure when we arrived a few days early that the place was not only spotless but he had also left us a thoughtful letter and a bottle of wine, it finally felt like after weeks of hardship back in California, we were feeling good about things again.<br/><br/>The fast internet, well set up kitchen, and cozy living room made it easy for three business people to both work remotely and still be comfortable. I highly recommend Matthew’s place if you’re a business person seeking easy access to the highway, amazing internet, and a super host who will not only accommodate your needs but also effectively communicate and make your stay problem free so you can focus on work or leisure!<br/><br/>Tons of cute restaurants nearby, we loved settling in at night around the fire pit or sitting inside and watching movies while ordering pie from the Shari’s nearby. Enjoy!"

42796228,701853586,2020-10-18,229481694,Stephanie,"Matthew’s place was a perfect weekend home away from home. The house was easy to find, easy to access, thoroughly cleaned and well organized, and quite comfortable. There were thoughtful touches throughout the house to make the stay more comfortable (makeup remover wipes, extra toiletries, coffee creamer, etc.). I was happy to find fans for white noise as well!

42796228,740693445,2021-03-20,288659630,Lanelle,Private home with an amazing host who is very understanding and communication is above all. House has a very nice fenced back yard inside the home you have plenty of space for a family with complete kitchen two full baths basement and a beautiful room with skylights upstairs to listen to the rain home is very close to the freeway entrance which is nice and many close by restaurants and stores.
42796228,741982307,2021-03-24,370955017,Rosalie,"Oh my goodness this place is not worth the money. The house was terribly unsanitized a d lots of hair in bath cabinetry. The electrical outlets were not working in upstairs bathroom had to use extensions. The dryer had an electrical short which caused breaker to constantly trip. There were no blinds or window cover in bathroom facing street side for privacy. Both Kitchens window did not have blinds and property is closed to a fwy. We felt unsafe. Back yard was not mowed and grass was over 2 ft tall. No patio furniture in back patio, Not with the money. Carpet stained and not professional steamed cleaned and sanitized."
42796228,742707305,2021-03-27,302984610,Melisa,"The place was clean, however a tiny smell upstair. The host let us know before arrived of the odd smell.  The small window in the bathroom upstairs needs to have a curtain or some kind of conceal for privacy. The host had wine ready and it was good to have that especially after a long drive.  The location was a short drive to stores. Overall, my family appreciated the host’s hospitality.  He was a great communicator and a family-focus. He provided guidance on attractions in the area and that was very helpful."

We booked this house for almost 2 months. He was very flexible with the booking as our work is unpredictable and credit limits were not high enough. Highly recommend staying at his house! He gave my coworkers a home away from home!

The house was perfect for our us, centrally located and a sanctuary when we needed it. Everything necessary to run a house is provided.

42796228,505903670619030567,2021-11-28,395047210,Nancy,"The neighborhood is sketchy. I didn’t like leaving my car in the driveway! The bathrooms were lacking amenities. The upstairs bathroom didn’t have a towel rack, mirror, hair dryer or toilet paper holder. The shower fixture did not fit onto the holder, so it just hung from the pipe. Communication and Check in ran smoothly. There was a bottle of wine waiting for us.  I felt like I paid too much for this rental. $150 per night would have been more appropriate."

Rotting subfloor in the upstairs bathroom, cobwebs throughout the house, sticky kitchen floor,  baseboard trim literally falling off the walls, not to mention an active construction site on his property which makes the backyard useless and dangerous.  Tons of homeless parading the streets/neighborhoods of this property"

No gathering allow, if a friend or a family member are planing to stop by plan to do it at the street/outside. We were trying to be away from the house because we were uncomfortable.

42817285,768288224769661757,2022-11-25,111472228,Joe,"If you have a family, stay at this place! There were toys for the kids. Thick padded carpet throughout that allowed the kids to play without driving ya nuts. Big beds, and a perfect location to get around the area with ease. We enjoyed our stay."
42818351,620686054,2020-03-23,145685791,Samuel,This was perfect! Brand new and I got to be the first! Michael was super friendly and responsive. Very roomy and comfortable! I would like to stay here again!

42818351,640647544,2020-07-20,356112927,Rebecca,"Michael was a very nice and friendly guy. Unfortunately we were most looking forward to the pool, and it was in process of switching chemical cleaners so we were unable to use it. Michael was super understanding and let us get a full refund and find a new spot to stay, if the pool had been useable this would’ve been a great getaway."
42818351,643451431,2020-07-27,345484492,Valarie,"My husband and I stayed in this lovely apartment space for our honeymoon! <br/><br/>The apartment itself was much more spacious than we had anticipated. I really loved how much natural lighting came into the apartment. It was also very clean and well put together.<br/><br/>Besides the space itself, we really enjoyed that we were staying so close to downtown Salem (about 5 minutes away). There are so many things to do downtown, we easily spent two days of our trip roaming around the city. <br/><br/>Michael was a great host! He was always quick to respond, and even left us a nice surprise for when we checked in! He also took the time to give us a few recommendations for our week long trip.<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"

42818351,410191710915194646,2021-07-19,854111,Jessie,"Great spot- super clean & nice to have A/C. We did not use the pool, but it was a great option for the hot summer days. Towels were super fluffy and the bed was new and medium firm. We had a fantastic meal at Epilogue in downtown Salem and would suggest it to anyone visiting. We did not know the neighborhood but there were some tennis courts nearby and we took a  walk around the near by blocks to the sounds of chickens! We would recommend this as a great stay in Salem!"

I advise using the directions from the AirBnb site and not GoogleMaps as we used.  We hope to stay there the next time we visit.

Any time me or my guest needed anything he provided it with incredible speed. When he says you have the place to yourself, you really have it all to yourself. Never a knock on the door or intrusive behavior from either him or the other guests in the area. I would absolutely recommend this place, or any of Michael's, to anyone coming to visit Salem."
42818351,669611652984934054,2022-07-12,416918898,Wendy,This home is just amazing!  It was so clean and the sun room was a incredible bonus.  The owner Michael was so amazing!

The space is wonderfully renovated and sits in a quiet and cute neighborhood.  It takes about 2 minutes to drive into the shops and restaurants of the main city.  We enjoyed a dip in the swimming pool on a hot afternoon and made use of the new public tennis courts right across the street.  The space stayed cool during the hot days and felt very private and comfortable.

We appreciate your very updated methodology from the booking to the on site, to the entry procedure, and finally to the exiting process. Very ingenious!<br/><br/>We will definitely keep you on our Salem accommodations list for a return visit.<br/><br/>Again, thanks for the use of your suite!"

42818351,784219716491003021,2022-12-17,488750785,Alex,Great stay. Salem is an interesting place to say the least. But this AirBnb was quite and comfortable.
42818351,794334615989854996,2022-12-31,345192851,Kevin,The place is nestled down a quiet street. It was super clean and comfortable. Michael was on top of things communication wise. You can tell he really cares about guest satisfaction.
42818351,814597776347340500,2023-01-28,490972103,Alvaro,if I was able to check in on our agreed time it would have been perfect  but I had to stay somewhere else overnight because he had other guest in the house when he had said it be empty
42995714,627484365,2020-06-02,73120527,Jamie,"This was our first long term airBNB experience. My husband and I were extremely comfortable in how this home is set up. The fenced backyard is filled with gorgeous flowers and we enjoyed hanging out in the backyard quite a bit! Andrea even reminded me to check the strawberry plants for delicious strawberries, which I thoroughly enjoyed! Having an office space was amazing, my husband was able to work from the office  without issue. Fresh cut lilacs were in season and on the table when we arrived, such a nice touch. We were able to take some nice walks around the neighborhood and stores were close by. Could not have asked for nicer hosts. This was the best airBNB experience I have had so far!"
43402510,628569462,2020-06-08,43899254,Ann,Helen is a Dynamo and made everything great for my stay! Nice deck to sit in the afternoons!

43402510,684132040330338129,2022-08-01,460774396,Vijay,Host is very nice. Location is close to grocery stores and other things. This is a good option for long stays.
43402510,780550364459683125,2022-12-12,484765147,John,"Helen is great. Always communicates well and fast via text. She really cares about providing a good clean place. I felt at home.<br/><br/>The other people staying in the other room (at different times while I was there) were both very quiet. I barely saw them. We did share the bathroom between our rooms, so you don't get your own bathroom. But, again, they were always gone, it was hardly a problem.<br/><br/>Lily the cat is adorable.<br/><br/>The house is on the far side of West Salem, so you'll always be driving in and across the bridge. Not the end of the world, but not walking distance to downtown. Bus route nearby.<br/><br/>The room was quiet and secure (she gives you a key to the door, which is nice, though I ended up just not even using it, since I felt so comfortable.)<br/><br/>The kitchen is clean, and it's totally cool to come down and fix food. Sometimes Helen is hanging out on the couch watching tv, but she's fine with folks coming down. I think she actually likes having people around.<br/><br/>I'd stay here again."
43402510,803045238296403314,2023-01-12,237666442,Jeff,"Helen is a wonderful person and host.  The house was clean and comfortable, communication was great, and good location."

43582845,574670350995217536,2022-03-03,233174432,Stacy,"Cute cottage that meets the needs of a busy traveler. All available amenities were clean and modern. The bathroom is a bit small and the street lights stream in a bit. Also very close to an industrial area so you don’t really get a neighborhood “feel”, but I felt safe and comfortable."
43582845,581950915137659579,2022-03-13,395417566,Ryan,Really nice place in a great location. Brandon was super responsive and very helpful whenever something came up. If I ever have friends visit this will be the first place I recommend to them!
43582845,594992625027509313,2022-03-31,443702776,Oliver,Nice small house good for 1 or a couple. The location is in the industrial part of town but not far from stores and restaurants.
43582845,600113007295891988,2022-04-07,46255566,Kelsey,This house is perfect for a longer stay! I had enough space to set up a work station and was even able to do laundry. The living room is great for relaxing at night and watching tv and the kitchen was stocked with any item necessary to make meals if you choose. The neighborhood is quiet and within a few days I felt at home. Check-in and check-out was very simple and easy. There’s lots of local restaurants and stores nearby as well as some national chains. I had a very enjoyable experience here!
43582845,602202172999736865,2022-04-10,207596143,Linda,"Comfortable, clean and super cute place. Host was awesome. I would stay here again."

Additionally, the bed was quite comfortable and the linens (both bed and bathroom) were spotless and soft.  The location was  convenient to downtown and the neighborhood was quiet.  We slept very well.<br/><br/>I would also like to add that Brandon was very quick to respond to all my communications.  Though we didn’t need anything once we arrived, I feel certain he would be Johnny-on-the-spot should assistance be required.<br/><br/>I would definitely consider this place again should our travels take us back to Salem."

43582845,612370100015929012,2022-04-24,128912070,Courteney,"Brandon was a fantastic host. I don’t think I honestly wanted or needed for anything. The place is clean and equipped with anything you can think of.<br/><br/>Not that this is SUPER important, but the pillows and throw blankets he had available were AMAZING. I actually had to look them up to get some for my house haha. <br/><br/>It was the perfect little place to stay for a visit. Also was really nice that he had shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, because I totally forgot mine. Thank you!!"
43582845,613850771025217431,2022-04-26,155628816,Gable,"Brandon’s place was fantastic. Well stocked bathroom, comfy couch, big TV. I only stayed for one night, but could have easily stayed there long term!<br/><br/>One thing to note:<br/>    The garage included is fantastic, but a bit small lengthwise. My car (15ft 4in) fit, but only just. It’d be great for additional non-car storage!"

There are a few pots with lids, some simple cutting board mats and two ways to make coffee. The host supplied complimentary coffee as well.<br/><br/>Accommodations are fine for a single or a couple. The bed was quite comfortable - a nice foam mattress.  <br/><br/>The driveway can hold two cars easily and street parking is ample.  We didn't have any issue with noise -there is a fairly busy street two blocks a way but it was really unobtrusive. <br/><br/>Close to multiple supermarkets. A very short ride to downtown Salem.  Easy access to route 22 for a drive to Monmouth or Independence or Dallas OR (each about 25 minutes away).<br/><br/>The neighborhood is pleasant and mostly residential with some offices or commercial activity on the fringe (where the house is located) but I wold not call it ""industrial"" .  We felt very much at ease.<br/><br/>The hosts are very considerate - many small details are provide for to make your stay hassle free.  Overall a humble small house that will meet or exceed any reasonable expectations."

45791126,745643830,2021-04-04,16090695,Sarah,"One of the best Airbnb’s we have ever stayed in. Everything is nice - comfy beds with nice bedding, keurig works great, very cute neighborhood, great floor plan - just lovely. Like staying with friends. Our family lives in Salem and this will be our go-to place to stay."
45791126,746668691,2021-04-07,215294936,Paul,"Faith's house was easy to find, well located in Salem, and had a simple to use combination lock for the front door, nice security and no mysteries as to it's operation. The house looks almost new, with nice finishes and comfy furniture.  The kitchen is really big and easy to keep clean; we needed to make our own food so the kitchen was a must, and Faith's exceeded expectations. Great stay!"
45791126,750134462,2021-04-18,107838470,Mat,"This house is what I had always envisioned a traditional Airbnb stay to be. The neighborhood is very upscale, quiet and safe and just a hop, skip and a jump to Costco, the Lancaster Mall and pretty much anyplace you need to be in the greater Salem area. The home is beautiful and private. Everything is well made including all furniture and amenities which are top-of-the-line and comfortable. The kitchen is well stocked and spacious. The showers are great! Comfortable beds, you name it. Everything you could possibly need is there and we truly felt at home. Faith is a true Airbnb professional. Very quick to respond to questions and very welcoming. If we find ourselves back in the Salem area in the future, we'll be checking on availability at this house for a return visit. 5 stars isn't enough, book with confidence!"
45791126,754831005,2021-05-03,133747579,Ramona,"Faith’s home is beautiful, spacious and comfortable. It’s all that it’s described to be. And located in a wonderful community. It was close to the I5 making our commutes easy, and near all the needed resources for food and accommodations. We would definitely come back to stay and share it with all our friends 😄"

45791126,386238134691876667,2021-06-16,217076735,Mary,"Great place, very clean. The only thing is extremely long checkout directions including getting the laundry going."

We found our stay to be comfortable and felt like it was one of the best Airbnb’s we have stayed in.  My family of 4 was very happy.  The master bathroom is incredible and luxurious (heated floors!).  The home was very clean, which is so important to us.  The neighborhood is beautiful, we felt very safe.  The host was very responsive, I had a special request and she graciously accommodated us.  I would 100% recommend this location, just book it!  I wish there was more than one tv, that was the only thing that could have made it better.  Even so, I would still rate it 5 stars!"
45791126,415195109597148297,2021-07-26,203848454,Bob,Faith’s home was a great stay for us and bigger than expected.  Our family now has to reserve 2 hotel rooms whenever we travel.  This house is perfect for a family of 6 (or even more).  The price we paid was comparable to having to get 2 hotel rooms for the weekend but provides the atmosphere of a wonderful home.  The area is quiet and still within 5 minutes of anything we needed.  Great experience.

The kitchen offered basic cooking supplies which allowed us to cook more meals. The only downside was having one small tv in the entire house."

It's easy and quick to get downtown (10min). The house is very clean and modern. The kitchen is excellent and we were able to prepare a wonderful birthday dinner. The living room has a gas fireplace that keeps the entire area cozy and warm. It turns on and off with a switch and we all loved this feature. The master bedroom and bath are deluxe; VERY nice. The modern laundry room and third bath are on the side of the house with the master. On the other side of the house are three bedrooms and another beautiful, full bath. great accommodations for everybody and privacy too. This a great value and we noticed no shortcomings."

Other than what we think was a bird in the morning making a rattling on the chimney pipe we enjoyed the area. The house was clean, had what we needed plenty of towels and beds. Getting into the home was easy. The driveway was a little tricky with the angle and our larger vehicle but it worked. We would stay here again when we come to town and recommend this house to others staying in the area."

We had 6 folks and there was plenty of space and room for all of us. We cooked 3 of the nights and the kitchen was stocked with all the necessary equipment we needed (loved that the fridge had the water and ice dispenser). We had plenty of towels in the linen closet (I hate it when you get rationed out one wash cloth and towel per quest). We also appreciated the desk having multiple outlets so all of our electronics could charge in a central location. Thank you Faith for making our vacation so enjoyable.

It was the perfect location for our visit, just 2 miles from my daughter's house!  The kitchen had plenty of cooking implements, three choices for coffee production, (including the coffee for a few days)! <br/><br/>We had some trouble with the TV function, most likely due to our lack of experience with Smart TVs, and we don't have streaming accounts. However, since we were there for Christmas with the grandkids, we didn't need any additional entertaining!  <br/><br/>We will definitely stay at this accommodation in the future if it's available!"

46656862,734563689,2021-02-26,389511446,Jeff,Mina's home is 1930's vintage that she has put a lot of love and attention to and it speeks for itself.  Mina made me feel at home instantly and was very respectful. Verry good human. I would most definitely stay again.

46656862,740097247,2021-03-18,27383785,David,Minas place is great.. historic and quaint.. even better is the hostess.. she is the 'hostess with the mostess' awesome fun person that makes u feel comfortable and pets u do ur work but always attentive to any need .. I don't want to recommend this place because I want it to be empty so I can come back haha but it's a great place I will love it
46656862,742207952,2021-03-25,143081911,Aurora,"This is a real,old world home. Lots of privacy with your own entry, bathroom and bedroom with the run of downstairs. Lots of stores close by and 5 minutes from downtown Salem.  The hostess couldn't be nicer or more helpful."

46656862,641398749668907256,2022-06-03,60566034,Margaret,"Mina's room was in a great location, convenient to South Salem where I was taking a class. Her house is on a corner lot, on a busy street during ""rush hour"" traffic, but it was quiet at bedtime. She had coffee and tea available and a small refrigerator. The bath was outside the bedroom door, easy access. I loved the shower! The bed was comfy. I slept fine.<br/>There were several restaurants and a grocery store nearby...very convenient for grabbing a quick meal or a few groceries.<br/>Overall, it was a pleasant stay for my one night visit to Salem."

46656862,654357051435940136,2022-06-21,170107986,Stephen,"Great location in West Salem! From Mina’s we could walk over Union Street steel bridge, through Riverfront park and over the “taco” bridge to Minto-Brown Park and back. (About 3 miles). The space is adequate and comfortable, however no real kitchen facilities beyond fridge and microwave."
46656862,657307349298984621,2022-06-25,12548948,Kathleen,"Great little apartment.  Very private and well-equipped.  Good location and friendly host.  The air-conditioner was turned on for my arrival on a hot day. Mina is in the process of getting the house and garage painted and the yard landscaped and things are a bit untidy at present.  However, that's not a problem because the accommodation itself is super."

Even though I didn't talk face to face (which was perfect for me) I had the impression she would have helped with whatever I needed. 😀 Thank you foe a terrific stay
46656862,668956877568895272,2022-07-11,58240718,Greg,"Really enjoyed Mina's place! We were in town for a race and her close location to downtown was perfect. It was quiet, clean, and overall great experience. Her communication around check-in and during the time we were there were very appreciated. If you're needing a room in Salem, go with Mina."

46656862,686993223884315989,2022-08-05,173660818,Lance,I really loved this place and  thoroughly enjoyed staying here. Located in an older Victorian type home in a good neighborhood. It was always quiet and peaceful. The place itself is well appointed and Mina is a gracious host that is quick to communicate and easy to talk to. I will definitely be coming back.

She accepted a late check in and provided very descriptive check in details for my arrival. The room was super clean, the air conditioner was left on for us, and the bed was super comfy. Bottled water, snacks, tea, and coffee were provided and much appreciated. My only complaint is that I wish we could've stayed longer!"

Mina definitely went above and beyond to give that calm/cozy feel. The bed is super comfortable, plenty of blankets and pillows, a cute little TV, and the breakfast nook was perfect. 10/10."
46656862,738428681254264981,2022-10-15,211275698,Monse,"Great place to stay at, it was very clean and private. Nice amenities and treats. Good location to stay while visiting Salem."

46883743,727735583,2021-01-30,339282590,Sonal,"We were just here for a quick 1 night stop over in our long drive. It was the perfect spot for a restful night as it’s close to I-5 highway and saved us driving time. Also, for one night sleep, it was a prefect home - very clean, beautiful looking, nice mattresses etc which was all very useful and exactly what we needed. It also has a nice yard and fun touches like fish aquarium which we couldn’t enjoy as much because of lack of time but I am sure folks coming for longer, will utilize this and find it really nice to have a comfortable living in the house."
46883743,729270105,2021-02-06,192010253,Yeorgi,"Very nice and clean home, I highly recommend this house to anyone looking for a place to stay in Salem."

46883743,745074169,2021-04-03,2062386,Vithal,"The house is very new and comfortably housed our family of 2 adults and 2 kids. Bed, bathroom and entertainment was great. I liked that we could park in the garage. We liked it and will come back.  One area of improvement could be in the kitchen which was very basic with one pot, few pans and plates/cups/glasses. It missed basic stuff like salt/sugar."
46883743,748032029,2021-04-11,71116828,Natalie,"Thank you so much for everything! You’re Airbnb was absolutely perfect for my mom, kids and I! It’s absolutely beautiful and had everything we needed and more! 5 stars!"

46883743,750614276,2021-04-20,192739468,Carolyn,"Ashley is such a wonderful host, and her home is very comfortable. The hold does not have all of the kitchen equipment that one would normally expect in an AirBnb, but that did not put a damper on our stay."
46883743,752064399,2021-04-25,390214272,David,if your looking for a clean home away from home feel then this is the place for you.   Ashley is awesome!

46883743,389111367975886618,2021-06-20,389017504,Osvaldo,Ashley’s place was exactly what my family and I needed for a relaxing trip to visit family. <br/><br/>The open layout allowed for us to eat and hang out and enjoy each other’s company. The rooms were all clean and spacious enough! The extra bonus of the huge backyard was a plus with my toddler!<br/><br/>Will definitely look for this place again during my next visit!
46883743,396342941352848800,2021-06-30,106450817,Mario,Great house.  Comfy beds.  Very central to restaurants and shopping.  Will stay again for sure.
46883743,400015104782708806,2021-07-05,84596019,Thomas,Ashley’s house was great! Super clean. It was a great layout to have family over to visit during the day and after our kids were asleep. The only downside is that the kitchen supplies were limited. We had to borrow a few things from family.
46883743,407228906231710371,2021-07-15,6274668,Sheryll,"As others have described, this is a very nice home, but without some of the usual amenities one typically finds in a vacation rental. No top sheets, only a blanket on each bed. This is uncomfortable during summer heat and didn't feel good to our party.  The kitchen is missing a number of basics such as extra kitchen linens, collander and other tools. The patio has a metal bench, with no cusions, so too hot to sit on during the day. There's no outside table and chairs for the patio and no BBQ, making the outside virtually unusable in the evenings. We found it unusual that only the main bedroom has a bed for a couple, and the others are twin beds. As long as you are aware of what's offered, it's a nice place that works for a particular audience."
46883743,419636943941539125,2021-08-01,378736596,Cameron,"Great home, very clean and it has a great location in south Salem."

46883743,480480749270863145,2021-10-24,235547047,Lana,"A girls getaway to celebrate friendships of 40 years and a birthday! What a lovey home to come to at the end of the day and relax! The house is in an upscale, quiet  neighborhood with quick access to the freeway. The house is represented accurately according to pictures. We all slept soundly in the comfortable beds. Ashely was quick to respond to our questions through out our stay. We would recommend this house if you’re traveling to Salem in the near future."
46883743,484783410586751707,2021-10-30,427405558,Tru,"This was a cozy place. We were welcomed with a bowl of fruit, candies and house slippers. It was easy to get in the house and very convenient for my commute as my stay was business. I plan to stay here again in the near future. Ashley was a great hostess and was really promoted at answering my questions."

46883743,493549638565128833,2021-11-11,84385040,Amanda,"Comfortable beds and pillows but the house has bare bones accommodations otherwise. One 1/4 cookie sheet, one small sauce pan, no mixing bowls, etc. we were lucky we had aluminum foil in our rental car from elsewhere along our road trip so we could make dinner. <br/><br/>Location was quiet, easy to find and convenient for getting to and from the highway."

47091813,765478123,2021-06-01,292511516,Teresa,"I stayed here for 3 months and it was wonderful! Amanda and her family are incredibly kind and responsive with any needs or changes you may have! The apartment was clean, well stocked, and very cozy. Even with a long term stay I really never needed anything extra, the apartment has everything you will need for the most part! It sits is a very cute neighborhood in Salem and has easy access to groceries and supplies! I would recommend and stay here again!"

47091813,386235356173530364,2021-06-16,168909707,Sophorn,"We had a great stay here! The space felt very home like, and had great amenities and accommodations for the price. Amanda is very easy to work with and is extremely helpful. The kitchen amenities were great and we enjoyed being able to cook dinner instead of eating out every night. The windows don’t seem to open so you can get fresh air but besides that this place was 5 stars!"
47091813,391300530029702198,2021-06-23,22660327,Deirdre,"This is a spacious, well-stocked, and lovely apartment! Towels were super soft, and the bed was very comfortable. Cannot BEAT the location - walk to the Willamette Heritage Center, to the weekly Community Market, to Safeway, to cute restaurants...all from a quiet, tree-lined street. Was nice to meet Kevin in person, and Amanda was wonderful to communicate with. You need a permit to park on the street for longer than 90 minutes...hopefully they will have more neighborhood permits to share...if they do - be sure to return them for future guests!"
47091813,393527259051356457,2021-06-26,77340432,Devin,"Amanda was a fantastic host and this is such a great spot to stay in Salem! Amanda went out of her way to put an AC unit in the day we arrived because the weekend was going to be particularly hot. THANK YOU! <br/><br/>Hard to beat the location if you want to enjoy downtown Salem. Overall, a comfortable stay with kind and flexible hosts."

47091813,399243409682451176,2021-07-04,93897318,Victoria,"This charming unit was exactly what we needed for our stay in Salem. Check in was easy, with detailed instructions for everything, and great communication throughout our stay. This lower unit stays cool in the heat. Even though air conditioning was provided, it stayed at 70 degrees in 90+ degree weather. Many kitchen essentials, linens, closet space, and entertainment hooked up to the large TV, with fast internet for any other needs, were provided. Downtown was an easy walk, and has many shops and restaurants to satisfy anyone. Will definitely keep this place in mind when we come back. Thank you for sharing your space with us!"
47091813,401465941572482864,2021-07-07,62104080,Heather,Amanda’s place is fantastic! The location is fantastic and about 5 blocks from my office in downtown Salem. It was very clean and nicely done. Amanda is very responsive and communication has been great!

47091813,425346463407246237,2021-08-09,101852026,Barbara,"Good location in a quiet neighborhood -- easy access to downtown and nearby parks.  Comfie bed and pretty well-equipped kitchen.  This is definitely a daylight basement apartment with low ceilings.  If you're tall, it won't work for you.  Very responsive hosts.  Very clean and well-maintained."
47091813,552253707470196928,2022-01-31,18174016,Kevin,"Good location, has all the basic necessities. Quiet neighborhood. Also have a parking spot. This is a basement in a house with two other units so you will hear all the noises unfortunately."
47091813,595728605615954229,2022-04-01,430101424,Belveline,Host was always available when I had any questions or concerns about the place. very nice and friendly too
47091813,631908389888252674,2022-05-21,395208195,Erika,"Amanda’s property is absolutely amazing.  A super cozy apartment with all the amenities you could ever hope for, they have even installed 2 large water heaters in the basement to accommodate all the units so you will never run out of hot water while showering like most multi unit Airbnb stays.  The unit was immaculate upon our arrival and we could not in the month we stayed there find one thing to complain about.  We even brought our newborn son home from the hospital to this apartment and Amanda was more than happy to accommodate us.  Five stars all around.  If you need somewhere to stay in Salem, look no further."
47091813,701554098616890529,2022-08-25,271126658,Leticia,Best stay ever!!! Awsome communication  and accommodations!!!

47091813,723228127686617670,2022-09-24,36428254,Gary,"Place is very nice (for someone shorter than 6').  I did not see the information that the ceiling was 6'5"" and the shower was 6'.  Even with all that I enjoyed the space."
47091813,729770175924523829,2022-10-03,388860054,Kaleb,"Amanda was very easy to communicate with even when I had to change original plans. The room looked as it was described, very cute basement location."

47091813,733411200266180477,2022-10-08,426391081,Spencer,Hidden gem!!!!
47091813,738489806180245858,2022-10-15,11556541,Lj,"I stayed for a week at this basement apartment near the Capital. The pros are: includes kitchen, walkable to downtown and various eateries, and located in neighborhood of interesting historic homes. The cons are: no bedroom door so cannot be locked, windows cannot be opened so no fresh air, low ceiling (and especially low when taking shower), and during my stay, no extra supplies available as host out of state."
47091813,739206154975494014,2022-10-16,481009486,Paul,Great communication. Everything went smoothly. Everything was good.

Tressa's place was easy to find, had convenient parking by the front door, was clean and cozy when we entered, and had everything we could possibly need and more. She was very accomodating, and made our brief stay delightfully memorable. Will definitely come back the next time I'm in Salem!"

It was very clean, and had everything we needed. I would absolutely recommend this cottage."

47185169,433357057680948816,2021-08-20,360786611,Zoe,"This was a nice place to stay. The bed was very comfortable. The steps were steeper than normal, and didn’t have a stair gate at the top, which was a little scary traveling with a young child, but there was a good handrail. The kitchen had what I needed, and there was a nice screened porch at the back. It was a little tricky to find it, but the instructions provided were very helpful."
47185169,453652753414878937,2021-09-17,239156029,Michael,Tressa’s place is a great little cottage that was clean and very homey! We will definitely come back and stay in her Airbnb when we come back to Washington!
47185169,455057865422026346,2021-09-19,97454103,Gwen,"We absolutely loved staying at Tressa's place. She truly thought of everything you would need and it's one of the most equipped Airbnb kitchens we have experienced. It is exactly as described, has a dedicated parking spot, spotlessly clean, and a very comfortable bed. Although we didn't need anything during our stay we were confident that Tressa would have been of assistance. Highly recommended!!!"
47185169,460155470666217631,2021-09-26,285151238,Kathryn,This place was very cute and perfect for a couple! A little bigger and better than I expected. The alleyway is definitely a little tight. Would recommend to stay here.
47185169,465930851451857033,2021-10-04,195070585,Cyndie,"Tressa’s place was great! It was spacious than anticipated and was perfect for us. It was clean, private and quiet. The mattress was really comfortable. We would definitely like to stay here again when we visit Salem."
47185169,469644944569994990,2021-10-09,276927981,Caitlyn,"The cottage is a lovely little place to stay. Even though we didn't need much, it had everything we could need. It's a little tricky to find (especially in the dark), but once you arrive, it feels like a tiny home. It's easy to get around Salem from its location. We would stay at the cottage again, if the opportunity arises. <br/><br/>Also, it's no wonder Tressa is a Superhost: my boyfriend and I weren't able to make it for our first of three nights at the cottage due to me falling ill on the day we were supposed to travel, and she generously refunded us the first nights' stay. We highly recommend both Tressa and the cottage!"
47185169,471773128625969275,2021-10-12,41973583,Kimberly,"Cute and cozy. Couch was a nice place to curl up and watch movies. The loft bedroom was adorable and the bed was comfortable! Parking was a tad bit hard to find but other than that, no issues. Would stay again!"

47185169,476094091483745391,2021-10-18,74221562,Caryl,Very clean and located close to downtown.
47185169,478309286304753948,2021-10-21,270099889,Anna,"This is possibly the best Airbnb I've ever stayed in. 1) It was very clean - no one else's hair or trash was in the cottage! 2) The furniture was comfortable - comfy bed, comforter, and couch! 3) There were blinds/curtains on the windows! These 3 basic things have not been met at many other Airbnbs, so I'm very happy they were met here. I would stay here again."

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable, spacious, stay in Salem oregon."

47185169,588431676414654174,2022-03-22,156136413,Sara,"This is such a perfect place for 1-3 people who are staying in Salem for a short or even longer time. It's looks small from the outside but once you get in, there's a very comfortable couch, dining area, kitchen area plus upstairs is a whole floor with a bathroom, desk, and extremely comfortable bed. It's spacious and clean, and the heating works great on both floors. The parking space is very conveniently located right outside the front door, and as the place is located in an alleyway, there's no street noise. But you're also still just a 5 minute drive to the downtown area with lots of restaurants and shops. Finally, Tressa was lovely and very communicative. Don't hesitate to book here if you're stopping through Salem!"

47185169,628360552642525836,2022-05-16,195070585,Cyndie,We were frequent guests and love the place. Our son graduated from Willamette so we probably won’t be in Oregon for a while.

47185169,630524247807997376,2022-05-19,4829878,Nicholas And Patricia,"Tressa's cottage is cute and spotlessly clean.  It was a great place to relax. She gave us great info and a map finding the alley access.  The kitchen is well stocked but very small (one person at a time). The stairs are quite steep and hard to navigate, but the bedroom is large and the bed is very comfortable."

Easy access to Wi-fi and the TV was easy to figure out. I would definitely recommend Tressa and her cottage to a small party of 2-3 people. Very comfy. Good value for the price.

47185169,691431550627812623,2022-08-11,55030371,Abby,"This cottage provided a lovely stay for a week in Salem. Clean and well stocked with all you need. The location is tucked into a beautiful neighborhood. The 2 story set up is ideal if you are looking for a couple who both need to work from home. as there is a desk upstairs and dining table downstairs. The bed was very comfortable and that is usually what I look for when reading reviews. The kitchen has all the basics and a few extras, like a stand mixer. Tressa was very responsive with any questions. I will absolutely be coming back to this wonderful cottage!"

47185169,703717675963953935,2022-08-28,201925029,Shubham Chandra,"Place was well equipped with all necessities and very clean inside (from the outside it appeared a bit dirty due to spider season, but inside was very well kept and clean). The couch was perfect to just relax.  I think it's a great place for couples to stay and maybe even work for a few days. Host provided detailed directions and map which made the place easy to find.<br/>I wouldn't recommend it if you have small kids/infants due to steep stairs and because you have to be extra careful to avoid bumping baby's head due to low ceilings at some places."

I had to drive my bigger full-size quad cab truck and couldn't park right at the door, but that was really not a big deal.  Just found a spot on the street.    Tressa was great to communicate with, the cottage was very clean and well-stocked.  I plan on staying again."

A fullsize ironing board was such a welcomed surprise as most AirBnBs do not have those. Very private, very peaceful. It is an absolutely wonderful place to stay and worth every single penny."

They were there when I had questions (one was ""Can you be a witness at my wedding?"" asked the day before said event, and they were both there to help us celebrate), and they also offered me plenty of privacy. It was a great balance. The condo was clean, roomy and well stocked. It's a great location if you're touring Williamette Valley wineries and downtown Salem is just eight minutes away over the river. Can't say enough about my experience and the friendliness exhibited by Fay and Dan."

47958424,723314327222937038,2022-09-24,356790803,Sharon,"This flat was perfect for my rotation at Salem Health Hospital.  The location is perfect and the place is equipped with everything you need for an extended stay.  Very quite neighborhood and a beautiful park very close by. It was nice being able to park right next to the flat and not out on the street. Grocery stores, banks, restaurants, all very close by.  Would definitely recommend this property and host."
47987577,400042159886855811,2021-07-05,172843729,Jeannine,Looking for a small place to rest when you are not out exploring Oregon?  You found it!!   Amanda and Kevin were great!  I highly recommend this place for traveling adults but it may not be suitable for small children due to the creaky floors… but the house is over 100 years old with personality which makes it a cool place to stay.
47987577,419531778313580624,2021-08-01,407562934,Norma,100% recommend staying! Beautiful and quite neighborhood!! We definitely would stay again!!

47987577,520403829700767345,2021-12-18,358241354,Paige,"Great house I loved my stay! Host was very responsive and accommodating.  The place was very clean and bed was super comfy. The kitchen, bedroom and the closet are roomy.  Parking available. Safe, quiet and cute neighborhood. As stated up front the laundry is around back of house you have to go outside. so if you have a long stay planned be aware. But wasn’t a problem for me in my 3 month stay at all. The bathroom and shower are very small which wasn’t a problem either for me but just so you know. As stated there is a smart TV. There is no cable or local tv but you can stream if you have a Streaming service account. Highly recommend staying here a charming comfortable home, fair price. I would stay here again!"
47987577,528321977512400664,2021-12-29,24963228,Olivia,This was a perfect place to stay in Salem. The area is cute and centrally located. The house is super cute and cozy- a perfect place for our family to stay ( we have two small kiddos). We would stay here again!
47987577,602286229664864349,2022-04-10,45561173,Jocelyn,"Great location as a traveling nurse, super close to hospital and downtown. Big closet, lots of room for storage. Upstairs unit is perfect for night shift sleeping, and I thought the bed was very comfortable.  Had all the kitchen things I needed. Shared washer/dryer with other two units but I didn’t have an issue. A bit expensive but seems to be comparable to the market."
47987577,637077804139575416,2022-05-28,422424758,Kathryn,Super cute apartment really close to downtown.  The one downside is that the bathroom is pretty small.
47987577,661677453222661899,2022-07-01,23788553,Nicole,"Lots of space for just me, easy walk to my downtown building. Cute and clean. Wall unit worked well. Appreciated additions like a Brita pitcher and small coffee pot. <br/>At times wifi seemed a bit slow.<br/>Overall, very pleasant stay."

47987577,779054944278006917,2022-12-10,292568692,Camille,"Furniture not comfortable. They did state in review sofa not comfortable but bed was horrible. If ur a nurse, this isn’t a good fit for rest and relaxation. I worked nights and the host messaged me numerous times while sleeping, staying my car was in a different parking spot, my car isn’t here. Host even messaged me when I moved out. Place is very dated meaning not comfortable. I’ve never had a host message me telling me water will be turned off not telling me how to flush a toilet. Hard pass. If ur staying for a night probably okay any longer your back will hurt."
47987577,802266988761435287,2023-01-11,287660266,Daniel,"Great place to stay.  Amanda is friendly, responsive and accommodating .  <br/>Located in a nice neighborhood, the apartment is a short walk from downtown, so it's easy to get around and check out places."
48000304,733749592,2021-02-22,81939226,Elizabeth,This is a great place to stay! The location is convenient for guests to access different parts of the city. I stayed while an area power outage was going on. I still had a comfortable stay and the ability to use the stove top which is gas powered. The host was extraordinary! She met me during check in to walk me through everything in house.
48000304,736550304,2021-03-05,13975683,Carol,"I had a very special week at Sheri’s.  First of all, the house was immaculate, sizable, and very tastefully designed.  The price was remarkable for such a lovely experience.  Also, anytime I needed to communicate with Sheri, she responded very very quickly and always gave me informative answers.  I also appreciated the location of the house.  I could walk to a park, and then beyond the park to the downtown area.  Heading the other way, there were restaurants and a natural food store.  From so many perspectives, just excellent."
48000304,739483083,2021-03-15,129944245,Sharon,"Convenient Salem location in a nice quiet neighborhood. Fully stocked kitchen and comfortable beds were appreciated, as well as the big couch in the living room by the fireplace. Great stay!"
48000304,740352709,2021-03-19,389408053,Christina,"The house is in a beautiful neighborhood. Check in was easy and Sheri had great communication. The house design is beautiful. We enjoyed the nice lush lawn on a sunny day. The kitchen had everything we needed. This was amazing because we did all of our own cooking on vacation. I would definitely book this house again. I really appreciated the special touch she added, a bottle of wine with a congratulations of our anniversary. It definitely wasn't expected, made the place feel like home."
48000304,741812376,2021-03-23,159856487,Dennis,"Sheri’s place was a true home away from home. The space was filled with all the modern conveniences, clean, and sprinkled with personal touches. It had everything we needed and more. The space was large with ample seating and had a cozy fireplace to congregate around. Also, the location was perfect—centrally located, yet on a quiet street. <br/><br/>Sheri was absolutely amazing, incredibly kind and quick with responses. What a fantastic retreat!"

Its a great, safe, location near lots of good food. The house is older, but with nice updates, like a powerful showerhead and stylish furnishings. We loved the fireplace, which actually does a wonderful job at heating the living room. The office came in handy as well. I'd recommend this place to anyone and we'd love to stay again."

It was centrally located close enough to explore all Oregon has to offer from Multnomah Falls, to Cannon Beach on the coast and to Crater Lake. We also enjoyed a few fantastic new restaurants in downtown Salem. Would absolutely stay here again."

48138030,592094848749003697,2022-03-27,331812090,Rebecca,"Beautiful stay at quiet spacious 1BR.  Lovely outdoor space in great neighborhood with nearby walking trails & parks which we took advantage of stretching our legs in before we hit the road.<br/><br/>The ONLY thing we would have changed was very minor, but should know if you drive an electric car:  Both the other Airbnb's we stayed at were VERY communicative regarding the plugin for our electric car we were driving.  Since we were checking in later than expected at this place, I didn't ask regarding where to plug in.  But the other 2 were proactive in letting me know where and how to plugin to their places which I greatly appreciated so I was prepared when we arrived.  We didn't end up charging and instead had to power up before leaving at the Salem supercharger which added drive time to our trip vs just charging overnight.<br/><br/>Otherwise, very lovely stay, would absolutely stay here again.  Beautiful property."

Definitely will stay again."

It is immaculately clean, in an amazingly beautiful neighborhood, and very private.  She is such a great host, always checking to make everything’s ok.

However, she was incredibly responsive and helpful through the app. The location of this is perfect. I am a young woman, who was traveling alone and despite getting back to the location late at night both nights, I felt completely safe here. The home is beautiful, quiet, and cozy."

It's a nice big bright spacious private room with ample storage available for unpacking if you'd like. It was very enjoyable to walk by the lovely garden when walking to and from the private entrance to our car in the driveway parking spot right by the gate. The chicken coup outside is not too far from the private entrance, but the chickens were all pretty quite and unobtrusive. I only ever noticed a bit of quiet chatter from them if I walked outside. Comfortable bed, nice TV with Netflix, and I especially appreciated the water dispenser with a jug of clean filtered water. Also, the room just smelled really nice and clean to me; it was subtle, but a great enhancement to the overall feel and ambiance of such a relaxing place to stay."

48138030,690677151101321560,2022-08-10,388568554,Rachel,Nice place on the south end of Salem. My mom and I stayed over for one night while riding the Willamette Scenic bikeway. I would say if you are riding the bikeway that the last couple of hills to the house are a grind at the the end of the day. Either way it was clean and comfortable place with an affordable yard and sweet pup 🐶. <br/><br/>Debbie is a gracious host and was very accommodating with our unique situation with having bicycles. We would definitely stay again!!

Debbie’s place broke that cycle. Hands down, one of the cleanest, well appointed spaces I’ve had the pleasure to stay in. Like renters wrote before me, the bed and linens were fantastic! She created a very comfortable, cozy space with lovely, new furnishings. So much storage in the wonderful wall storage units, sweet table and benches to have some takeout or drink coffee, a warm electric fireplace and a  super shower. All in a spacious suite layout. <br/>Debbie is so friendly and kind and is incredibly responsive. Her home is located in a wonderful neighborhood and is a quick drive to town. So happy I gave AirBnb another try-thank you Debbie!"

48384939,743262610,2021-03-28,167652888,Emmaline,"Lily’s Air Bnb is great! There are amazing features that beat a lot of other Air Bnb’s in the area such as the nice shower, the Bluetooth speakers in the bathroom, the hammock on the porch and the giant king sized bed. Definitely recommend this Air Bnb!"
48384939,744091396,2021-03-31,117459402,Arielle,"Clean, cute, and comfortable! Loved my stay here!"

48384939,770189835,2021-06-13,128288440,Katie,"The studio was very clean and nicely decorated.  We enjoyed our stay with just a few items that should be noted.  The walkway to the studio is very steep, especially for those with knee issues and disabilities.  The second item was though there was a flat screen tv there was no access unless you streamed Netflix or something similar.  The other issue is the studio seems to be in a cellular dead zone and the wifi was unsecured.  Other then that the bed was super comfortable and the view lovely!"
48384939,386240145415634349,2021-06-16,118691908,Jenna,"A great, comfy, clean and private little getaway nestled among perfectly manicured grounds. A great stay."
48384939,389200485417805553,2021-06-20,76011294,Roberto,Lily was an amazing host and is very prompt in responding to your messages! Also this place has a nice backyard and little porch to sit outside and enjoy the views.
48384939,496491300143607878,2021-11-15,66804540,Mary Helen,The accommodations were as advertised and very clean . The studio is  actually more  spacious then l expected. The decor is modern and relaxing. Checkin was easy. Lily responded promptly to all my texts and was very gracious about my young grandchildren visiting. The location was great for our needs with a nice walking park and a creek right around the corner in a quiet neighborhood.
48384939,528305205076361786,2021-12-29,82031897,Shaun,Cute studio and nice neighborhood. Bed is really comfortable and studio is spacious. Lily is very responsive. Perfect getaway!
48384939,563858381534133317,2022-02-16,334483097,Óscar,"We had a great time I love the place I love the view, Unfortunately we couldn’t stay longer but thank you for having us"
48384939,566798424402266842,2022-02-20,372575963,Amelia,"This place was cute, neat, and served it's purpose for my husband and I for our weekend conference trip. Check in was easy and Lily was very nice and got back to us very quickly. The location was also good and not too far from town, but far enough that it wasn't in the heart of the city. We had a few disappointments though, the first being there was a lot of thumping upstairs that seemed to go late into the night and start early in the morning (if you're used to having an upstairs neighbor, it might not be too much of a distraction). Our second disappointment was that both the Bluetooth music feature and the TV did not work. We tired several times to find the Bluetooth network as labeled on the instructions, but none of our devices could locate it, making us wonder if the name had been changed but had yet to be updated on the instructions. The same thing happened with the TV. We followed all the provided instructions and downloaded the Chromecast app so we could cast our screens onto the TV, but it kept saying the TV was under a different Wi-Fi network, and that there were no devices on the Airbnb Wi-Fi it could cast too. We felt like the price was a bit high as well, especially since none of the electronic features seemed to work correctly -- the initial cost per night seems low, but the cleaning and services fees were pretty high. If we have to come back to Salem we will probably get a hotel next time, as it will be cheaper and also provide breakfast. However, if you like the experience of staying in an Airbnb and enjoy the aesthetic of a cute and cozy room, this place is right up your alley."

Then as we entered the unit it was immediately impressive, way better than the photos lead us to believe. The sofa bed was extremely comfortable, anything we needed was provided, and the place is close to a lot of great restaurants, parks, and museums. This has been our favorite stay so far!"

Very comfortable bed.  Spot on clean.  Great location to explore Salem and surrounding area.  Easy lockbox access just don’t lock the door by the doorknob as we did!  It’s easy to forget since this is how we lock our doors at home.  Great nearby breakfast suggestion is Patty’s Off-Center Pantry.  Enjoyed our stay at Grace House."

She thought of many nice touches and the area really felt homey and cozy. The location was central  and  perfect for day trips to many awesome locations.

48546846,441306941472536206,2021-08-31,276730902,Aude,"We spent one month in Kristie place. The flat was very clean, with housekeeping during our stay which we appreciated a lot. The backyard is really lovely. No need of AC during the summer, the indoor temp was perfect despite the hot summer outside. The flat may be more adapted for shorter stays as the kitchen is small, but we managed it. Kristie is a wonderful host, very welcoming,helpful and reactive. We really felt like spending <br/>time at a friend’s. We recommend this place."

The hosts communicate very well and the space is very comfy. it is the Basement so keep in mind you will hear anything going on upstairs. Everything is up to date and I absolutely loved that they had a washer and dryer in unit. made things so much easier during out stay. and thelocation is so close to many things as well!

48546846,652264140135507030,2022-06-18,48279764,Shea,"Salem is a great pivot point to the surrounding area and this is great for that.  We had day trips out to the coast, wine country, and spent a day downtown and the location is in the middle.  I would walk over to the river and the park most mornings and found Salem very manageable.  <br/>The venue is great for several reasons, some big and some small.  Having a parking space off street, fairly large space for what is essentially a studio basement apartment, large bathroom, modern decor, plenty of storage, w/d  and separate sitting area.  The space is comfortable for 2 to spend time and not be on top of each other.<br/>Some considerations that explain our 4 stars on value as opposed to 5:  It's a basement apartment so there isn't much light.  There are plenty of lights, but as a natural light person it did start to get to me a bit.  There is not a full kitchen.  It's the ""entire place"", which means different things at different venues.  There is street noise - while the location is in a neighborhood, it is on one of the main streets.  Again, overall we liked the place, but there are some nuances."
48546846,658013192259857302,2022-06-26,464649671,Henry,A wonderful place to stay! Very accessible and convenient location. All of the amenities you could ask for already provided and good communication from hosts.

The space’s layout was perfect for our stay and it was well-appointed with anything we could think of needing. Even in the dead of summer when days got over 100 we were cool and comfortable. Kristie was incredibly flexible and gracious when our trip’s dates had to be changed, as well."

Very comfortable all the way around - convenient parking, great King-size bed, great large screen TV and an amazing shower.  While we didn't use it, the washer/dryer was appreciated also.  we also appreciated having both a freezer (for ice) and fridge - very functional small kitchenette.  Nice coffee shop w/breakfast sandwiches three blocks away.  Cute neighborhood to walk around in - felt very safe.  Short two mile ride to restaurants downtown and conveniently located to several vineyards (we enjoyed Willamette Vineyard)."

The desk is an awesome addition for anyone traveling for work. The house smelled great and the linens were fantastic - two things I'[m really big on. I slept like a baby and would definitely stay again. <br/>I didn't get a chance to really explore the area, but the house is very close to a cool strip of shops and restaurants.

Instructions were very clear and had no problem using the common space. The Keurig coffee machine is very good, however didn't have easy access to cream/sugar/sweetner, as the main fridge was out of service and had to go to basement and get it.

48551936,566068069327284265,2022-02-19,627214,Andrew,"The host is gracious and accommodating, but there are a few things that aren’t obvious in the listing. The first is that the property is under renovation, and it is a work in progress. This is made obvious by the new fridge with labels attached in the living room, and cracks in the plaster in one of the upstairs bedrooms. The second is that the neighbors are obnoxious. The report of a diesel pickup starting up at 3am may not be what you bargained for. Bring earplugs. The third is that ultra-Christian politics are abundantly in evidence on the property. The wifi router name is JESUS-SAVES. Whether this is good, bad or indifferent is a matter of personal preference, I wasn’t entirely comfortable with it. The fourth is that there are more house rules than you would expect. Shoes are forbidden inside, which you wouldn’t know until you have seen the front entrance, in daylight. Consumption of any alcohol on the premises is forbidden, which you wouldn’t know until you see the litany of house rules posted in the bathroom. Sorry, beer lovers. The place does smell clean, in a perfumey sort of way. It smells cleaner than it really is. You get the feeling that the housekeeping folks have a lot on their plate, and hose the place down with Febreze and call it good. At worst, however, it is a vastly better value than any of the local hotels. It is warm, comfortable, and affordable. On the balance, I recommend Nick’s place."
48551936,576203543691037826,2022-03-05,447846640,Heriberto,Great place
48551936,597199831519449451,2022-04-03,329515605,Nick,"Great location, clean, spacious, quiet and awesome place to stay! I will be coming back the next time I am in Salem!"
48551936,602205733502481281,2022-04-10,191257962,Christian,The stay was comfortable and clean. Check in and check out were easy and quick. The outlets stopped working during the visit and the bedroom lights similarly stopped working. Otherwise a good time.
48551936,606576729348458940,2022-04-16,82907193,John,A nice room (and a half) just off the kitchen on the first floor of a house.  Nice and quiet.  Very convenient to Willamette U.
48551936,609507969907734658,2022-04-20,10217981,Char,"Comfortable, quiet home with very responsive hosts. You'll enjoy your stay."
48551936,612398413150521352,2022-04-24,70425672,Brittany,"Loved the character of this older house, settled in a beautiful neighborhood. Great landing spot for a solo person, ample parking and generally quiet!"
48551936,622478855632585310,2022-05-08,384956411,Teresa & Jim,"Great house, clean, comfortable, good location."
48551936,626831343473020191,2022-05-14,457149637,Haylee,"Great place, would definitely recommend."
48551936,803036031499467059,2023-01-12,462272588,Greg,A very comfortable room with access to kitchen and laundry. Quiet neighborhood. Needed to stay longer; hosts were very accommodating.
48564869,765497129,2021-06-01,138013653,Tricia,"Great space.  Well decorated, comfortable, and well stocked kitchen with everything you need to cook comfortably.  Very clean.  Neil responded very quickly with every question that we had."
48564869,432594614489118126,2021-08-19,380053480,Kamaree,Neil was very responsive and tried to fix anything that went wrong in a timely manner. We had an ant problem but that was quickly fixed! The apartment is very clean and comes with almost everything needed for an extended stay.
48564869,454351635950564119,2021-09-18,154748813,Dave,"This unit is really great as a home base for traveling around the area. We stayed here a month and we were more than satisfied. Everything in it was like brand new and extremely clean. The kitchen was well-stocked with cooking items and cleaning supplies. The mattresses and pillows were super comfortable and we slept great. The unit has some artful touches, so it felt homey, rather than sterile like many hotels. Neil is very responsive (although we didn’t need to bother him too much as everything we needed was there in the unit). As the listing says, it probably isn’t well-suited for little ones that crawl or walk, due to stairs and sharp corners, etc., but was just fine for our 5 month old, as he isn’t moving around yet. We felt very comfortable and well taken care of here. Would definitely recommend."
48564869,490685260066614959,2021-11-07,6570440,Laura,"Perfect host! Great communication and service. The place is perfect, just as described. Safe and quiet area. Highly recommend."

48564869,656593178995270893,2022-06-24,94664086,Stephen,"a very clean and quiet home near the heart of Salem. Fast internet with a working space provided. the beds could be a little more comfy but we are spoiled at home with an over the top soft mattress. communication with the host was flawless, anytime an issue arose we were notified promptly and it was addressed in a reasonable amount of time."
48564869,687801500608350549,2022-08-06,16645197,Leo,Comfortable stay.  Very accommodating host.
49034912,511637514193999292,2021-12-06,38915303,Gregory,"Would highly recommend this spot, especially when the farm stand is open! The hosts are easy going and helpful with awesome restaurants in the area and open with lots of ideas about anything you could want to do in Salem."
49034912,526198608993632305,2021-12-26,31321786,Christine,"Kayla's spot is even more beautiful than the pictures (which are gorgeous themselves!). It is a relaxing & quiet little haven which was convenient for us as we saw family in Salem and Portland. The space is cozy and calming and was the perfect nook for us to curl up in between family gatherings. Also very convenient for groceries, activities, etc. in Salem. We appreciated how communicative and responsive Kayla was and had the great luck of getting to meet both Kayla and her partner, Robert, as well as their pups (who were super adorable and friendly). Kayla had left us thoughtful, high-quality surprises (food, tea, milk, coffee/espresso) in the kitchen which was well stocked with the basics (minus burner stovetop) and all we needed for our stay. We also loved that you could order food/drinks from the Airbnb which was a unique touch. And on top of all of that, we were greeted with homey touches like sweet scents + Christmas decorations. Excited to return!"
49034912,527573500744989515,2021-12-28,155444654,Alicia,This place was great! It is subterranean a bit so slippers are helpful for the cold floors. overall fantastic!
49034912,528304840264846407,2021-12-29,13391943,Bridgette,"Such a charming space. Very comfortable bed, everything you need for a nice stay."
49034912,531229443607079417,2022-01-02,147802306,Caroline,"My good friend Caroline and I had an enjoyable stay at The Garden Flat at Botaneity. We were a bit frazzled upon arrival and Robert was more than kind to remind us it was about to be a new year and not to stress. Upon entering, the aroma of the place had us smiling big as it smelled like a piece of heaven. The kitchen was full of a variety of cookies, teas, hot chocolate and more complimentary goodies with upon request a s'mores experience and other food available for only a slight charge more. The TV had Netflix and Hulu which was appreciated after a day at Newport to come back to the place, make popcorn and relax together. There were countless lights, a heater, plenty of blankets, books and other misalanceous decor to take in. The fireplace made the trip in itself! We highly recommend playing around with the changing colors of the fireplace as that was one of our favorites from the trip. The bathroom was big yet comforting with plenty of towels and wash clothes. While we don't know Kayla and Robert personally, from our brief interaction and seeing them throughout our stay, we felt like we were always in good hands and welcomed at the place. They have two dogs which made us feel the love even more. They will be lighting the pathway in the coming time to make it easier to navigate the steps back to the place. There was only one minor manner that was discussed privately where we saw room for improvement to hopefully make your experience even better than ours. Please don't be afraid like we were to park in front of their house on the dirt path as that is what is encouraged by the host. It is a left turn after entering and is a quicker route to the place compared to parking straight ahead on the left. The common areas were inviting with gorgeous photos (which some of which are for sale we believe!) and cozy rugs. All in all, we could not recommend more to stay here if you're visiting Salem or the surrounding areas. You feel as if you're at home when staying here. They even make their own wine and have it available upon request for purchase. It doesn't get much better than that! These are genuine and heart warming individuals who have poured their all into their Paris inspired place. I hope you'll choose to support them just as we did. Thank you Kayla and Robert!<br/><br/>With all our love,<br/>Benjamin and Caroline"
49034912,534133334580674105,2022-01-06,251432196,Amber,"This was such a luxurious little chateau stay with easy access to town, downtown, and the highway. As soon as you park, you’ll be met by aromatic evergreen and crisp Oregon air. Kayla has thought through every element from the overall aesthetic, blended textures, and soothing pallet to the soaps, scents, and soft linens. It’s a serene little hideaway I would suggest for couples or a mother-daughter trip such as ours. 🤍 “Aimer!”"
49034912,542071592532016501,2022-01-17,232149916,Chelsea,"Absolutely the most beautiful, relaxing and aesthetically pleasing place I’ve ever been. Kayla  has thought of everything that you could possibly need for such a perfect experience."

49034912,553643904965969941,2022-02-02,284473220,Susan,Nice space. Comfy bed. Very convenient location. Appreciated the extras.
49034912,562367979962144846,2022-02-14,55461410,Sheena,"What a lovely and inviting space. The furniture and textiles are beautiful and thoughtfully curated. Diffusers are placed throughout the rooms, and it smelled wonderful. It was a bit cool in the evenings, but with extra blankets and the provided space heater I was warm and cozy. A previous reviewer recommended bringing slippers, and this was a great idea. <br/><br/>I encountered Kayla and Robert a few times, and they were kind and welcoming. Kayla is quick to respond to any questions or concerns."

Exactly as described , great location, and honestly a very safe place , which was important to me since I was traveling alone.<br/>The best part , the bed was so comfortable,  You  really don’t realize how important this is until you have it."

Kayla's communication was top-notch - she accomodated us so graciously and we were thrilled to be able to stay here during our son's robotic tournament at the fairgrounds. If you're looking for an upscale stay - this is it! Super fun and a great place to make some memories. Thank you so much!!

We had such a great experience staying here, and really enjoyed Kayla's farmstand with fresh pastries and coffee in the morning."

49034912,645130690452666730,2022-06-08,205367110,Sherri,Kayla was excellent @ response time and communication. Space did not work for us due to a few issues. However the host handle the graciously.
49034912,647894459186749954,2022-06-12,50468261,Gabriella,"Kayla's rental was even better than it looks in photos! It was nothing short of amazing. The space is very well designed, offering a very cozy stay with all the essentials you need. It is also much more spacious than it appears in the photos. <br/><br/>She added very thoughtful touches, such as coffee and gf/df treats, which came in handy due to a late arrival and not quite having our bearings first thing in the morning. She and her husband also run a small shop and have their own wine label that we were able to enjoy while staying at her property! <br/><br/>Overall, we had such a lovely experience and would love to do it again!"
49034912,649318250056638728,2022-06-14,120410982,Tazzi,"We had a wonderful stay! The space was beautiful and comfortable. The bed was a bit soft for our tastes but we were still comfortable. There were lots of outlets for us to plug in our medical devices and our electronics. The space was cold but there was a space heater and electric fire place. We loved the chickens greeting us in the morning. We were greeted with soft light, beautiful soft scents, and soothing music, and a sweet treat (which seemed to be homemade).  Great thought and care went into this space. We would love to come here again."
49034912,665259425990098657,2022-07-06,444962205,Susan,Pretty much everything we expected. An absolutely gorgeous place!

49034912,668945477560307667,2022-07-11,40316382,Petra,The garden flat has an incredible personalized experience. Thoughtful touches are all over the space including a menu of food options from their property and some fresh fruit left on the table. Kayla even left us with a bag of dog treats so we could become friends with Franky and Sam during our stay. Our expectations were surpassed in every way and we couldn’t think of a better place to stay while visiting the area. Big thanks to our hosts!
49034912,673253082288308871,2022-07-17,370608476,Kaley,Stay here!! My husband and I picked this place to stay for before and after our wedding! It is the most charming and romantic Airbnb. It was so clean and well stocked of everything. Couldn’t have been a more perfect place!

49034912,679725939542667051,2022-07-26,457430695,Lynda,A most enjoyable unique place to stay with such kind hosts.
49034912,697866650669565414,2022-08-20,65606245,Farley,"Stayed here a few nights while dropping my daughter off at college and hope to book it again anytime I come back to visit!   I was surprised that it was significantly larger than I had anticipated from the pictures.  The bedroom and kitchen are both decent-sized rooms and there is also an entry area and sitting room with desk and reading chair/ottoman, plus a large bathroom.  Everything was clean and the decor is well-done and makes it feel homey without cluttering spaces you might need for your own things.<br/><br/>While it is in the basement so, as Kayla notes, there will be foot traffic (human and doggy) overhead, I didn't find it disturbing.  However, If you are a very light or late sleeper, it's something you might want to consider.  I was concerned that it being a basement would make it somewhat dreary but was extremely pleased to be very wrong about that.  Most walls and floors are painted white and several windows let in the external light.  Best was the lighting in the apartment--there was a lot of bright overhead light you could use in every room if you wanted, but also options for lower level lighting, as well as two small reading lights on either side of the bed (a feature I think every bedroom should have but so few do.)<br/><br/>I didn't have any issues, so we didn't need to communicate much, but Kayla was very responsive with check-in and check-out communication."
49034912,702305891184033451,2022-08-26,138945438,Robyn,"Absolutely charming!!! This space is absolutely beautifully appointed, quiet and close to anything you need/want. The owners have thought of every detail to make it comfortable and a bit luxurious. They ""warn"" you about their fur puppies, but they were so quiet and unassuming. The pictures are completely accurate. Definitely would stay here again."
49034912,705139169989116323,2022-08-30,106257,Rene,"Gorgeous Airbnb, beautifully designed, actually bigger than the pictures indicated. Friendly hosts and gorgeous dogs. Would happily stay again any time I’m in the area. Thanks for having us!"

We loved making friends with the chickens, Sam & Frankie. The space was even a bit bigger than we thought. We will recommend it to anyone we know headed this way! Thank you for the amazing hospitality."
49034912,734916666475153409,2022-10-10,20119634,Jennifer,This was the perfect spot for a relaxing weekend in wine country. Beautifully thought out space with sweet little details. The host was very responsive and communicative.

49034912,744235291133783517,2022-10-23,69080485,Dev,Kayla’s place is very beautiful. Simple decor that still feels warm. The place is very bright for a basement and has the essentials of what you need for a short stay. Close to downtown salem with a five min drive. Far enough from the city so you have some quiet.
49034912,752976907791998919,2022-11-04,4168744,Claire,"The Botaneity basement is beautiful. Every detail is perfect. I would highly recommend staying here for a cozy, peaceful escape central to Salem and wine country."
49034912,760215567206427409,2022-11-14,8711434,Tyler,"Impeccably curated, great zones to work / relax in the space. Beautiful light coming through in the morning and close to downtown. Kayla was great and communicative. We couldn’t get the hot water in the shower to level we like, and it would be great to have the ability to cook food in the kitchen as they offer ready made mixes. Great stay and would certainly come back."
49034912,768995540737717394,2022-11-26,191114263,Karen And  Jim,"Kayla’s flat is adorable, with nice touches throughout. Communication is great and she is very timely. You have a very safe and cozy feeling when you stay here!"

49034912,790713528879442116,2022-12-26,176055210,Cydney,"This is the PERFECT spot for a solo traveler or pair of travelers in Salem.  <br/><br/>I arrived after dark & was having difficulty making my way to the apartment door.  Robert came down to guide me, making me feel welcome right away. <br/><br/>While it’s a basement apartment, it doesn’t feel dark/claustrophobic. Lots of natural light; once the sun sets, there’s recessed lighting throughout & plenty of floor & table lamps. The space was  incredibly warm for having concrete floors & throw rugs in a few spots as there are space heaters in each living space.  Even with the December cold, I felt warm and cozy.<br/> <br/>The décor made it feel like a French chateau.  The place is stocked with lots of goodies & extra toiletries.  Since it was Christmas, I didn’t get to see the winery, but I would definitely make the trip back down for it.  It’s a beautiful property set off from the road. I can just imagine how nice it would be to do a wine tasting in their workshop in the summer.  <br/><br/> Many thanks to Kayla & Robert!"
49034912,799354459770065087,2023-01-07,168234440,Cassie,Kayla was super helpful and accommodating for my stay. The place is absolutely incredible! Immaculate vibes for sure- definitely worth it!
49034912,805187486217570213,2023-01-15,21507930,Betty,I live just 15 minutes from this space and this is the second time I’ve rented it to just have a weekend staycation away from my busy household and just relax.  I love this space!!!
49034912,821892655804946123,2023-02-07,101163289,Debra,"Lovely lower level apartment, tastefully renovated, with a decent amount of light for a basement. Despite space heaters, we found it cold and drafty so it may not be the safest choice during wintertime.  Outdoor stairs are a little hard to navigate in the dark or in wet weather."
49034912,826882741936889243,2023-02-14,447902055,Carolyn,Wonderful little pied-a-terre! Felt like Paris! Warm and cozy this winter. Can’t wait to experience it in the summer with a glass of wine outside!

49922598,444965133601153195,2021-09-05,146054005,Lacy,Our stay here was wonderful! Dilani was such a kind host! Everything was clean and exactly what we expected. I appreciated that there was air conditioning and that the house was well stocked with essentials. The location is great with it being just a 5 minute drive from downtown.
49922598,490602575266115834,2021-11-07,2093213,Shawn,What a spectacular place!  And the special touches are a great surprise like a fully stocked refrigerator and pantry!  Will definitely be staying there again!

49922598,526925465284737145,2021-12-27,136814316,Carrie,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We stayed over Christmas and there were even some Christmas decorations. We had plenty of room for 5 adults. The only thing  to me aware is that there is only one TV I’m the house.  My teenager used the TV room as his bedroom, which wasn’t an issue during Xmas, but could have been an during another timeframe. We will definitely stay here again."
49922598,540648388475719505,2022-01-15,26606089,Nicole,Evolve is very easy to work with. The house was perfect for my crew traveling for work.
49922598,574676714846492749,2022-03-03,17042930,Veronica,"The Diva's Den was a perfect home away from home for our family of 5.  We were in Oregon visiting family in Portland and Salem and came across this house and so glad we did, it is just a street down from both my mothers-in-law and also my sisters-in-law house, so it was absolutely perfect! The home itself is very comfortable, clean, and well set up. The TV room was great for our daughters and those who wanted to watch TV away from the living room where family was having conversations. This is a very cute and nicely decorated home, it made we want to come home and decorate mine a little cozier! The amenities where a huge, unexpected plus, the host has a well-stocked kitchen, with the basics such as spices, oil, butter, etc, but went above and beyond by purchasing a few items for us before we arrived, such as breakfast items consisting of bacon, sausage, eggs, yogurt, coffee, creamer, bread, orange juice, and a bottle of Oregon Pinot Noir and chocolates!! The bathrooms had shampoo and conditioner, I had brought some so didn't need it, but it just shows the thoughtfulness put into making her quests feel comfortable and at home. The Host, Delani (I believe is her name) checked in with us via text and made sure we had everything we needed.  She has brochures on restaurant and winery recommendations as well as things to do in the area. Downtown was very close, maybe 5 minutes if that. Just down the street and walking distance to Safeway, this home was very convenient. The outside back yard is so nice, we only wished we were able to make use of it and BBQ, but it rained the entire time we were there.  We will definitely be back in the future as long as it's available. Thanks Delani!"
49922598,600088965941401962,2022-04-07,450741459,Merry,"We liked our stay for the most part.  We were happy with the hostess, her kindness and generosity in providing food for us and making our lengthy stay possible.  We liked the full kitchen and would have liked some cotton wash cloths and a drainer for the dishes.  Some utensils were missing like large spoons and spatulas.  Loved getting the variety of coffees and gluten free/lactose free food.  Unfortunately we were not able to enjoy the lovely back yard do to business and weather. <br/>The two things stood out as negatives and those were the comfort level of the beds (may be just our special needs since we are seniors), and the smell in the house.  This is a subjective thing, as we are very sensitive to the floral scents of detergents and cleaning supplies.   Overall the stay was nice and very homey and the hostess went above and beyond to be helpful and gracious."

49922598,795744470576263387,2023-01-02,120600268,Dan,Danila is one of the kindest and most responsive hosts I have ever had and I've done airbnb a lot.  She bought a coffee grinder when we texted her that we had gotten some whole bean coffee for Christmas and was completely responsive to our needs.  And her house is REALLY fun with plush and interesting furnishings and decor.

50119734,768950633572906535,2022-11-26,145183743,Roger & Rufina,The home had a very well-stocked kitchen and we were able to prepare meals for a family without needing to purchase anything but food.  A really special touch was a full water cooler for our use.  We had plenty of room for everyone and the beds had cozy soft blankets.  Check in and check out were very easy.  It was a very quiet neighborhood and conveniently located near downtown.

The house was lacking nothing that we needed. The very comfortable beds with real comforters on top made for a great nights sleep. We will be back next year!
50349038,519585697839393274,2021-12-17,159260763,Briana,"Me & my husband traveled to Salem to work at the local hospital. Originally the plan was for 3 months, but we ended up staying almost 6 months - I don't think we could've picked a better place or host. Neil's place comes with all the comforts of home, and was clean, well decorated, and convenient. The unit is centrally located to everything in Salem. Multiple grocery stores, eateries, and attractions nearby. PDX is about a 50 minute drive away and made traveling to surrounding states for business super easy! Neil's communication skills are flawless - quick, flexible, and efficient! Throughout the stay we had no concerns or problems and would gladly stay at Neil's property again if ever in the area & would highly recommend to anyone needing somewhere to stay in Salem. Overall & easily Neil is one of the best host I have encountered and owns one of the best Airbnbs I have stayed in!"
50349038,573977258980281847,2022-03-02,432871618,Tania,"Perfect!!  This beautifully decorated home was an awesome place to start our new lives in Salem.  The home is clean and comfortable.  Our host Neil is very thoughtful with the many amenities stocked in this home.  We were able to do everything we needed as if it were our own home, and not have to run to the store to buy extra things.  The home had all the appliances, kitchenware, bedding and towels, cleaning supplies and full size washer and dryer, so we didn't have to worry about anything!  The services included with the home included Smart TVs, High Speed Internet and Home Security, which kept us entertained and secure when we stayed indoors.  <br/>And last but not least, Neil was a fantastic host!  He made sure we had open communication from check-in to check-out.  From giving directions to the home, helping replace a broken appliance, to making sure to ask how we are doing, and if we needed any suggestions for fun things to do in the area, he was always there when needed.  We were very fortunate to be able to call this place our home away from home, even if for just a short time."

50447645,425442362107437927,2021-08-09,104561782,Beverly,The Garden Cottage worked great for our stay in Salem. Clean and comfortable.  Convenient to  main streets. Quiet neighborhood. Nice step-in showers. Large refrigerator/ ice maker.  We thoroughly enjoyed staying in Angela's house. Definitely will stay again.   Enjoyed the fresh bouquet of Stargazer Lilies.
50447645,450025041725332001,2021-09-12,385907976,Judith,The Jefferson Cottage was absolutely amazing! A cute spacious home away from home stocked with everything you could possibly need!

As well as some snacks and a list of local recommendations!!!  Staying here maybe it possible to cook at home nearly every evening and truly enjoy time as a family together.  <br/>The bed was soooooo comfy!  I usually have back issues when I stay away from home, but not here!  <br/>There was body wash, and tiny shampoos, etc left for us.   Oh, and curly hair ladies….there is an awesome diffuser hair dryer!    <br/>WE HIGHLY recommend this property.  The owner was fantastic, the home is fantastic, and the location super central. Give this home a 10 out of 10 !"

We enjoyed the wonderful yard and quiet neighborhood.  Being an older crowd, we had some issues with the stairs.  They are very steep and might not work for every group."

When we arrived, the house was decorated with Christmas decorations. There was so much care from our host that I can't express in a short review how personal our stay became. Thank you Angela for taking such great care of us."

50447645,556612227345823715,2022-02-06,15489109,Sonya,"The Jefferson Cottage is absolutely fantastic! We booked a 3-night just under a week out due to an unfortunate family emergency in the area. Angela was so friendly and warm and the check-in process was easy and seamless. The cottage is outstanding - welcoming and cozy - and the perfect place for our last minute weekend. We arrived to find a bottle of wine and snacks, which we eagerly devoured after our drive! The cottage had everything we needed from coffee to toiletries. The layout was perfect for two couples, allowing us to each have our own bathroom and bedroom on separate floors. There was also a cute extra bedroom we did not use at all, with two twin beds. The living room on the main floor had comfy seating and a fireplace. We did not use the basement rec room at all, but we peeked down to check it out and it is appointed with games, books, a comfy couch, and a nice fireplace! The cottage had a home-y and welcoming feel and all the modern necessities. Overall we had a wonderful time at the cottage, which was so appreciated during a stressful family situation. Check out was easy. I would highly recommend the cottage and would certainly stay here again the next time we come to town!"

50447645,605166641151059499,2022-04-14,133024123,Audra,"Wow. We were charmed by Angela’s place the moment we pulled up the driveway and saw her tulips and sweet garden. The house was wonderful and sparkling clean. Angela gave clear instructions and such a warm welcome. She even keeps gardening shears in the kitchen, so guests can clip a bouquet of blooms from her yard. We loved walking the vintage neighborhood. We had chilly rain (and some snowflakes), so it was awesome to have the cozy gas fireplace in the evenings with a cup of tea or good coffee (provided by Angela!). There was a bedroom and bath on the main floor, which was great for my mom so she didn’t have to go up and down the stairs. We’d never spent time in the Willamette Valley before, and this was the perfect base. So easy to get to Riverfront Park with its carousel, downtown Salem (delicious lunch at the Wild Pear) Silverton, the Oregon Garden, Silver Falls State Park, and Wooden Shoe Tulip Farm (spectacular!). Honestly, we can’t wait to go back. And we would DEFINITELY book this cottage again."

The kitchen has most of what you need to cook, and there are grocery stores nearby for anything you might be missing. I'd highly recommend this house."
50447645,622483797087298236,2022-05-08,421151183,Colleen,"Was very excited to stay here! Beautiful property and listing showed 3 separate bedrooms, two with queen beds and one with two twins. There were three of us, so three separate rooms was perfect! Unfortunately when we arrived, they had locked one of the queen bedrooms up "" since they only host people listed"". We had brought an unexpected guest child due to unforeseen circumstance. I texted host upon arrival since situation happened that day. We weren't notified of locked bedroom prior to entering the house. I asked host if door could be unlocked she responded she couldn't come unlock until after 8pm the last evening of the stay(which honestly is pointless by then). I ended up sleeping in the twin room with my teen since my adult daughter is too tall for twin bed. Unexpected kid had to sleep on a sofa. Dead flowers in kitchen upon arrival. We still tidied up, washed all the towels, ran the dishwasher, took out the trash and recycle despite our lack of beds we fully paid for. This place would have been decent if the bedroom had not been locked. Disappointed and will not refer any of their properties in the future."

It was clean and had everything we needed.  The beds were so comfortable!  The landscaping was beautiful and the neighborhood was quaint and quiet.  Overall, a very nice place to stay."

50447645,692098480108011645,2022-08-12,121568450,Kathleen,"We loved this home in a beautiful neighborhood! So well taken care of, and the attention to detail was spot on. Close to many services and amenities. It was a perfect space for our group of four - the three bedrooms on two levels was great for privacy as well. The lower level family room was just perfect for watching movies and playing games. We most definitely will stay there again!"

50484701,419623636601003381,2021-08-01,227516459,Elena,"Everything was perfect, we very much enjoyed our stay. The bed was perfect, the kids loved having a tv to watch during our down time or to watch movies at night. The location and parking where great, we had the shopping center literally around the corner. We will stay or look for this place if we decide to visit Salem again."
50484701,429673504913680251,2021-08-15,6670029,Gargi,"Carole’s place is wonderful! It’s beautiful and spacious, with all the amenities one can think of. The bed was one of the most comfortable I’ve ever slept in. The host left snacks and some wine for us, which we really appreciated after a long day out. One of the days, we locked ourselves out (our own stupidity) and Angela was very prompt in opening the door for us. Overall, very safe, convenient, comfortable and close to restaurants and bars. We highly recommend it!"
50484701,431900411865792870,2021-08-18,188889712,Amber,Great place! Will definitely stay again. Even accommodated a last minute booking request late in the evening without skipping a beat. Thank you!

50484701,449290790851518196,2021-09-11,56293018,Karen,"Had a wonderful 4 night stay in this well appointed, comfortable, conveniently located apartment.  Some of the prior reviews have mentioned street noise, but after about 10 or 11 p.m. it is fairly quiet through the night, and picks up the activity again about 7:30 a.m. on weekdays and remained pretty quiet until about 8:30 on Saturday.  <br/>The location is wonderful if you want to get out and walk, shop, go to restaurants and experience the area.  There is fabulous walking along the River and over into Minto Island.  The restaurants in the area are plentiful and varied from fine dining (Rudy's Steakhouse), to sushi, Thai, pizza (A Slice of New York Pizza just around the corner), bakeries, etc.  While maybe in past years this area might have been sketchy, it is certainly experiencing a rebirth and is quite vibrant - the exception maybe is the Salem Mall that seems to have had better days.  Yes, some interesting individuals now and then, but what city doesn’t have that, and it felt very safe.<br/>The apartment itself was really clean and well furnished.  The kitchen was well stocked with cookware and essentials (thank you for the wine and chips!),  as was the laundry and bathroom. It allowed us to travel lighter than in some places.<br/>My husband was in awe of the shower!  He’s 6 foot 2 and usually has to scrunch down in a shower, but the head was up high and adjustable for me.  The shower also had nice power and controls.  It’s great to start out your day with a pleasing shower!<br/>We appreciated the brochures and information about local areas to visit and not left unnoticed was the pride of ownership and respect for the apartment with coasters left in many places and with leg covers for the chairs to prevent scuffing the floor.  These little touches demonstrate the care for this historic apartment/building.  <br/>As others have mentioned, the communication has been quick and thorough and it was easy to get access to the apartment and to park in the public parking less than a block away (with street parking also available for up to 3 hours)."
50484701,450785692298964246,2021-09-13,84818903,Marilyn,The views from this AirBNB are amazing....huge 8' windows overlooking downtown Salem.  I wish I had known about this property on previous visits to Salem

50484701,561723372059177090,2022-02-13,26303385,Andrea,"A great apartment in the heart of Salem! Fantastic location—walking distance to restaurants, bakeries (yummy cannoli and coffee nearby!) and adorable little shops. A beautiful park with children’s playground is right down the street and street parking was readily available during non-peak hours. During our stay (over a weekend), the street and nearby businesses were bustling at dinner time until about 11pm, and then very quiet until late morning. The home was outfitted with all the necessities and was very clean, comfortable, and plenty spacious for our family of 4. Our hosts were generous and left a welcome gift and even delivered a fun surprise for our young kiddos to enjoy during our stay! This is a sweet spot in a sweet little city."
50484701,563852016028278362,2022-02-16,97828466,Margaret,"Great spot in Salem with good amenities within the apartment and great experiences within walking distance. The street was a bit noisy in the evening, but that could have been because I stayed over a holiday so there were more people out than usual.  I had a spot of trouble getting into the apartment at first, but Carole took care of things and had great communication with me throughout the visit. Would stay here if I'm in the area again."
50484701,575413257477155846,2022-03-04,68416926,Richard,Great place well appoint and centrally located. It has everything you want. The front bedroom can be a bit noisy but a white noise app on your phone fixes that. The back bedroom is quiet. It is a great value and I would repeat.

There’s the minor inconvenience of the 3 hour on-street parking only but that is out of her control. The home was nice and homie. Perfect place to stay with coffee stands, restaurants, bars within walking distance."

Lots of shops and eateries within walking distance and also very close to the Riverfront Park and Minto Island Park for a nice evening stroll. The loft was clean, stocked, had secure entry and just one other occupied loft across the hallway. Parking was not a problem.

There are so many restaurants to choose from. We even got to watch a Mardi Gras parade from the window on our second night. Super memorable and would highly recommend.
50484701,838580883845170455,2023-03-02,44439178,Nicholina,This place was just what was described and just what I needed for a midweek stay for work.  Fun being able to hang around downtown and then be right at home after a great dinner or a pint at one of the breweries!
50599685,396426023451880820,2021-06-30,6548794,Elizabeth,"My husband and I stayed at the Loft for 4 nights this past week. We are working from home in Portland and when the PNW heatwave struck, we looked for a lovely spot with central air to avoid the heat with walking distance to vegan restaurants, space to accommodate two remote workers who need great wifi and space for yoga! The Loft was all those things, plus comfy beds, incredible amenities (gorgeous kitchen with full cooking set up -- we ended up making more meals in than out because of this beautiful kitchen!) and the space was gorgeous beyond my expectations -- the photos do not do this historic space justice. We loved staying at the Loft and took walks along the Willamette River and enjoyed the downtown eats! Highly recommend Slick Licks for vegan ice cream! :) Carole was an extremely responsive host and was wonderful to coordinate with, there was free parking and check-in/check-out was self serve. We can't wait to visit again!"

Host was very responsive to all communications. One caution-don’t leave anything valuable in your car. Our window was smashed but the car alarm scared them away before they could grab anything in the vehicle. An annoying footnote to an otherwise delightful trip.

It is fabulously conveniently located in downtown Salem, with a terrific café on the corner. The street is a bit loud with traffic at times, one might sleep better in the bedroom closest to the bathroom. We so enjoyed exploring the town and the waterfront.

The location was exactly what we wanted so we could get around by foot downtown, but with parking available.<br/>We only needed a two rooms, but this has great entertaining space if you are getting together with others for some games or dinner. The kitchen was perfect for hosting and we will select it again if we do that in the future."

50599685,768937081735823328,2022-11-26,29602107,Dave,"Right in the heart of downtown Salem is a sophisticated, charming loft worth your investigation.  City noise was not an issue.  The elevated kitchen is unique and a great idea for the space; well equipped, easy to use.  Beds are comfortable with plenty of blankets.  Furthering the loft motif, the furniture and decorations fit perfectly.  The floors are truly beautiful.  The site pictures are a true depiction of what you will get; not just well staged photos.  Don't click further, this is the place to stay in Salem.  We will be returning."
50664432,404567467715202334,2021-07-12,216641665,Tai,Nick left us without access to his listing and never responded to messages and phone calls. We were lucky another host was willing to accommodate so late at night.  You been warned.
50664432,660977159943873810,2022-06-30,462272588,Greg,"Nice and comfortable. Very quiet location, centrally located."
50664432,668895058563775307,2022-07-11,62435363,Daniel,"It was good for the money. I stayed there last year and had a great experience. This year was a bit different, provided feedback to the hosts, hopefully they will implement improvements and you will have a great experience as I did last year."
50664432,679113504575097877,2022-07-25,145045803,Sheli,Thank you for a clean space and excellent communication. We appreciated our stay!
50665003,397789395713081596,2021-07-02,390543057,Amber,"Not a good experience. The check in time was 3:00pm, i was not able to get into the room until 7:00pm. i asked for a refund, and the would not give me the refund and instead made me wait 4+ hours past the check in time to even get into my room which i found very inconsiderate. Also, the AC in the room was broken, and given the heat wave we’ve been having of over 115 degrees, it was extremely uncomfortable and hot the entire stay. Unfortunately i would not stay here again."
50665003,400020354936157016,2021-07-05,31000604,Natalie,"Potluck rooming with 4 beds upstairs, 1 master downstairs in a large historic home with charming interior.  Big bathroom upstairs.  Roomy kitchen / living room/ dining.  Fridge out of order, would need to go downstairs to use (luckily didn't need a fridge or the kitchen).<br/>The woman who keeps the home tidy was very friendly.<br/>I stayed weekend of the 4th, hot days, and the hosts were really hard to get ahold of.  Checked in 3rd eve... messaged on Abnb and left voicemail regarding a non-performing AC unit.  Hadn't heard back from them by message or phone until the next afternoon when I inquired again.  I cut a bit of slack for the hosts being out of town on a holiday, but... this is a business right?  <br/>However, did allow me move to a new room with a working AC unit for night 2.    Was a pleasant stay otherwise."
50665003,664563245967867246,2022-07-05,454417968,Jonathan,My stay was extremely comfortable. Nick and Julia we great hosts and are very communicative. This was my second time staying here and I would gladly book again.

50673630,408045216757543106,2021-07-16,340861,Kelly,"I really cannot say enough about Jean. She is the consummate host. Being at her beautiful Salem home had the feeling of staying with your favorite aunt but without any downside. The accommodations are lovely, everything is spotless, and Jean provided us with various daily treats. She even serviced our room daily which I didn’t expect at all but which was a delightful surprise. The location was perfect for our needs and you can walk to the amazing Word of Mouth Bistro. Also there is great parking that is gated at night. A note for anyone mobility challenged, the space is up a rather long set of stairs. We will definitely be back!"
50673630,631213729503944870,2022-05-20,361259130,Weston,"This was my second stay at Jean's home, and it again, was wonderful."

Great beds and excellent location for visiting my son at Willamette It is across the street from a high school - but it was the weekend so there were no students around. The neighborhood was very cute and the kitchen had everything we needed. We would definitely stay there again.
50877729,468184833022910328,2021-10-07,387019587,Wynter,Very convenient and cozy location!
50877729,470262205969391334,2021-10-10,36830766,Mike,"Great location! Blocks from  restaurants, bars, shops, Riverfront Park. Loved the bed, shower was great and there was pretty much everything you could need. It is a 100+ year old building and the heater does not work great so it does get cold. Bring a sweatshirt, use the blankets or portable heaters provided and you will be fine. Also, this building is downtown so you can expect to hear cars and people throughout the day and night. If you come with that expectation you will enjoy the space and location. Carole was quick with communication."

50877729,602940588138286181,2022-04-11,63616033,Genevieve,"We stayed in Carole's loft for two weeks while our home was undergoing repairs. It was a wonderful experience and was just what we needed for our little family. Carole was a fantastic host and was super quick to respond to any and all questions.<br/><br/>The loft had absolutely everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We especially loved having a washer/dryer and dishwasher in the unit. The space heaters kept us cozy and toasty. It was fun to be downtown and run out for coffee and pastries at the lovely cafes and bakeries that are in the vicinity. We enjoyed taking the baby for a walk at Riverfront Park which is a block away.<br/><br/>Thank you, Carole, for letting us make the loft our home for a few weeks."

The bedrooms were cozy. Each had a desk and adjustable lighting . The table was in the nice big kitchen which had everything needed to cook.  Carole is a great communicator and reached out for any questions or needs we may have had. Warning you must be able to climb the stairs.

Everything was as described. Lots of amenities to make our stay even easier, and an amazing Asian market on the corner to boot! Beds, towels and kitchen utensils were high quality. The location could not have been better for us as we were visiting our son, and we felt very lucky to be able to stay so near to his apartment. Jessica's place was perfect for our needs and we would definitely stay again."
50919816,574719912551816464,2022-03-03,136490433,Abraham,Beautiful. Incredibly easy to relax and disconnect for some good R&R

50919816,607305887181950560,2022-04-17,4264131,Aba,"Jessica's place is an excellent home away from home. Very cute and warmly decorated, but also lots of very functional and thoughtful details. We would definitely consider staying here again!"

50919816,697225322660161076,2022-08-19,390496724,Arleigh,"The inside of the home looked exactly as expected. Jessica has done a wonderful job with decorating this home, which we appreciated thoroughly. She communicated quickly when issues arose. It was odd to have neither a television nor a dishwasher, but those are small in the grand scheme. Our largest concern was that prior to arriving at the home it’s difficult to tell the neighborhood it lies in. We did not feel safe due to the types of individuals walking past at all hours of the night. Men on bikes sat outside watching us unpack."
50919816,703667562489087772,2022-08-28,331032479,Samantha,It was awesome!! Super cute and decorated so well!

50919816,709552875664432026,2022-09-05,84553153,Ray And Stella,"When I got there, I was pleasantly surprised by the updated interior.  It looked fresh and well thought out.  Plenty of dishes, pots, pans and yes, a toaster!  I should have asked beforehand, but after having arrived late in the evening, I didn't consider to plan breakfast.  After all the listing said breakfast was included.  I just figured I had not found the access instructions yet.  So I messaged the host. I got the reply well after normal breakfast hours the next day. There were supposed to be some oatmeal packets in the basket with the tea and single use coffee.  There were none.  But I did not message the host and report it.  Breakfast was already over.  I had found more things that I did not like and that was just the topping.  In all, good for a couple or small family to stay while doing other things, as long as you don't want to watch TV.  Use the chain on the bathroom door or it will wander open. Have fun watching the squirrels play in the trees of the back yard and the children in the school playground on the other side of the chainlink fence."
50919816,737065306468165630,2022-10-13,64946539,Leslie,"This is a sweet cottage, nicely decorated and comfortable. It was perfect for my home base while taking a workshop at the Kroc Center. Jessica's response time was quick and helpful."

50919816,771126766881504223,2022-11-29,39981274,Holly,Jessica is an exceptional host and incredibly responsive and proactive with communication. We had everything we needed and it ended up being a great launching pad for downtown activities and heading out of town for bike rides and hiking.
50919816,850055072012496688,2023-03-18,178966797,Ryan,Jessica was excellent at communicating and checking in on us. Thanks for the stay

Had just enough dishes, pots and pans so that we were able to cook some meals at home. We were close to a grocery store and downtown and could safely walk many places. The beds were comfortable, sheets and towels amazing. Glad to have a coffee maker and toaster. I would definitely stay here again if we come back to this area."
51004299,465945559056446223,2021-10-04,30533641,Samuel,"This is a great little place, easy walk to Willamette U, and downtown.

51004299,493587520415819097,2021-11-11,76092549,Marti,"This is an older house that has been well remodeled without losing its historic charm such as the many built-in cupboards and fireplace.  The location is very convenient. It's within walking distance of a grocery store and many of the local attractions. The place was very well equipped with almost everything we needed, including a washer and dryer. Wi-fi worked well & was easy to connect to. <br/>This is a great place for a stay in Salem. We'll try to use it again the next time we're in town."

51004299,557304368093368316,2022-02-07,150474854,Kanye,"Carole is very communicative and hosts a wonderful spot to stay. It's very clean, great location, and has everything you would need during a stay!"
51004299,571143955687405164,2022-02-26,243022838,Yesenia,"Carole was very kind to let us book this place super last minute. Spacious rooms. Beds were comfortable. We did see little bugs on one of the beds but we think it was just due to it being near the window. Doors may open unexpectedly probably from it being an older home… Was a little spooked when reaching out to host after hearing 3 loud thumps on the roof we got the response of “if you’ve got a ghost it’s new to you. I certainly hope is not wanting to stay! 👻😜” sooooo we’re sorry if we left a ghost there. Read upon another review someone was in the basement upon their arrival thinking she had the place to herself. Would not recommend staying here alone. But if you’re a heavy sleeper, a man, this would be a nice place for you :) We were not able to stay there another restless  night but Carole was generous enough to give a refund for the remaining night."
51004299,576868059906155249,2022-03-06,401153706,Cayce,"All in all we would stay here again!<br/>The house was lovely, and the neighborhood was also lovely. We had a little bit of trouble finding where to park (it was dark when we got there) but that was a maps thing and had nothing to do with the property itself. If your GPS tells you to go turn on 14th st go to 13th instead.  The house was great, there were some additional condiments in the fridge and washer and dryer in the basement, and a really fun guest book."
51004299,581232969571577234,2022-03-12,85388545,Kristine,"This was a great place to stay for our visit to Willamette University.  There was a short walk to the grocery store, to a great breakfast spot (the Sassy Onion), campus and downtown Salem.   We didn't have a car and we didn't need one. The house was a cosy, homey place to come back to at night.  I enjoyed all the period cabinetry - fun doors and doors in the kitchen and the bathroom.  Fantastic shower!  I hope we'll stay here again if my son decides to attend the university."
51004299,587060110907537093,2022-03-20,26250784,Katie,"The house itself is great. Location couldn’t be better - close to downtown with lots to do in the area. The only bathroom in the home is upstairs.  Coffee is provided, but other pantry items are scarce. Thankfully there is a grocery store two blocks away! Our only minor issue is the parking - the street parking in the whole neighborhood is permit parking only. We had 2 cars but Carole was only able to provide 1 guest permit. When I asked about public street parking nearby, I never got a response. Thankfully, we didn’t get a ticket, and I’m not sure what we would have done if that happened."
51004299,592782606008079838,2022-03-28,289240986,Sonia,"Love this place … clean , cozy and quiet … walking distance to Willamette University, downtown and grocery store around the corner and of course the beautiful capital."
51004299,607973428226360862,2022-04-18,32922979,April,Great location. The place was comfortable and had everything we needed. <br/>Thank you!
51004299,622529163734081532,2022-05-08,148923655,Nancy,The house was clean and quiet and met our needs well.  The location was ideal for visiting Willamette University and downtown and convenient to stores and restaurants.  The beds were comfortable and the host was responsive when we had a question.  The only issue we encountered was that the kitchen did not have sufficient equipment to prepare simple dinners.
51004299,628361262345330785,2022-05-16,9281127,Elizabeth,Super centrally located but quiet and easy parking due to dead end street. <br/><br/>House is lovely- lots of vintage charm and clean and well appointed - everything we needed for our stay.<br/><br/>Highly recommend!
51004299,632626703301648894,2022-05-22,94719967,Victoria And Mike,"This is a great place! The home is spacious, clean and bright. You are able to walk to the downtown area for shops and restaurants. Carole is amazing, easy to reach and a very attentive host. I highly recommend staying here!"
51004299,638442085972261669,2022-05-30,35890228,Kristine,"This is a good base to explore Salem, it is maybe a 10-minute walk downtown. The property was little older than I was expecting but it was clean, has a brand-new shower, and the beds were very comfortable. Carole was extremely helpful throughout our stay!"
51004299,642851674882756477,2022-06-05,460780109,Gabriel,Very beautiful place and great price too<br/>We had a great time here

Angela is a fantastic host, great with communicating and very accommodating. The location was great, near stores and restaurants, very convenient."
51004299,665952623042423666,2022-07-07,132212554,Michael,Charming and tastefully appointed home in a great location.  Quiet street.  Very clean and comfortable.
51004299,682665757336198267,2022-07-30,8736170,Mary,"This sweet house has been carefully updated without erasing its period charm. We found it close to groceries, restaurants (Word of Mouth!!!yum) and liquor stores. It was close to downtown for shopping or eating. House was clean and well equipped. And we very much enjoyed the air conditioning as it was a HOT one in Salem."
51004299,715991015784888574,2022-09-14,52677259,Wendy,Lovely quiet house in Salem. Older building but everything was clean and in good repair. Will definitely stay here again next time I’m in the area!
51004299,720314043506340064,2022-09-20,16835424,Jack,"I came out to help pack up and move my son. Packing and moving is never fun, and normally arduous, so having a quiet place to stay at the end of each day was really important.<br/><br/>Well, this place for the bill perfectly — a bedroom for each of us, a quiet neighborhood at the end of a cul-de-sac, with a grocery store just a block away.<br/><br/>I couldn’t have asked for better, and the host was remarkable in every way.<br/><br/>This one made my Favorites list."

51004299,741354156530021907,2022-10-19,90863480,Alan,"The house was very comfortable and well maintained.  The kitchen was nicely outfitted with lots of pots, pans cooking utensils, cutlery,  glass & dinnerware.  Coffee was readily available - both drip and Keurig -  as well as various other useful kitchen condiments.  The location was excellent for our purposes and Angela (the host) was very prompt and helpful in responding to a couple of inquiries we made of her.  She did an excellent job taking care of the house and the guests.  We were most pleased with our stay.  Thanks Angela!    Alan and Sharon"

51004299,851495055447204172,2023-03-20,65065730,Thanh,"Clean and charming Airbnb within walking distance to Willamette University, restaurants, and parks. Bedrooms and bathroom are upstairs. Laundry machines are in basement. The permit parking only applies to weekdays. There are plenty of street parking spaces without permit restrictions near. We had a very nice stay. Thank you Angela."

51019464,844327500391050970,2023-03-10,63803861,Yoshi,"Angela was a wonderful host. She was responsive to all of our needs. If there was something that we needed, she did her very best to accommodate us! The place is nestled in a quiet and small cul de sac. Neighbors are pleasant. The house is spacious with a cute patio. Nice study area. Plenty of space! Extra linen was provided and she even has a host of games for entertainment! Would recommend to any travelers in the Salem area!"

51021341,566745216799973893,2022-02-20,112609265,Fisher,"What a fun and unique place to stay in downtown Salem. This rental has safe, private parking and a full kitchen and bathroom. Lots of room for two people and it's close to downtown restaurants and bars."
51021341,605135374526700185,2022-04-14,101425427,Stephen,"Amazing location in downtown Salem. Close to everything you need and a has an available parking spot. Very clean, and comfortable. The hosts were great and communicated well with great instruction for checking in easily."

51021341,622524229535508507,2022-05-08,65065730,Thanh,"The location is smack downtown. Park, shops, and Willamette U are just a few blocks away. Expect traffic and people noise even at night. Parking is secured behind a gate. It’s a clean, spacious and comfortable unit. Carole is wonderful. We slept well and ate well. Did not do any cooking."
51021341,624717143331616393,2022-05-11,30453956,Irene,"Great location, in close proximity of the University. There a tall flight of steps up to the unit, so be prepared to carry your bag up. Besides that, check-in was very easy and we enjoyed staying at this apartment!"

51021341,628365991477753740,2022-05-16,115435671,Maureen,"My second time staying at the loft. Love all the space, Netflix on the TV in the cozy livingroom, lots of light and closet space in the bedroom and the fabulous downtown location where you can walk to great cafes and restaurants. We visited Archive coffee, Tap Root and Epilogue and loved them all. Definitely recommend."
51021341,642813664511286876,2022-06-05,19259786,Julie,Fabulous and perfectly located for our trip. Very comfortable and welcoming.
51021341,647834664973291662,2022-06-12,8927541,Brian,We rented both of the Tiger Station lofts and it was the perfect situation for our larger group (with one baby in tow). So cool to stay in downtown Salem! We could walk everywhere and trust that logistics would be simple.
51021341,655850776569557442,2022-06-23,36830766,Mike,"We had a great stay at the Lofts! The location is awesome!! Short walks to so many restaurants, bars and shops. We also loved being 1/2 block away for runs and after dinner walks through the 3  connected Riverside parks. Secure parking was a plus to leave the car and explore on foot. Angela is a quick communicator and great host. Definitely recommend the Lofts if you are coming to Salem."
51021341,657996351660904560,2022-06-26,523523,Wendy,"Easy check in with helpful directions, dedicated parking spot and well-stocked unit.<br/><br/>Lots of nightlife in the area and a nearby train. Pack earplugs if you are a light sleeper.  <br/><br/>Excellent shopping and restaurants all within a short walk. <br/><br/>Unit is clean, comfortable, tastefully decorated and secure. All expected amenities and quite a few nice extras are included. GREAT Wi-Fi- helpful when working on vacation. Looking forward to returning."
51021341,663135394828332448,2022-07-03,7729654,Sarah,The perfect spot to explore downtown Salem! Great space overall and would totally recommend to friends
51021341,668860326558936813,2022-07-11,36808096,Kelly,We were in Salem for the Ironman race and the location couldn't have been better.  It is situated by the Riverfront Park and all the restaurants and shopping.  The place is very comfortable and nicely decorated.  Large bedroom with a huge closet. It was great having a washer and dryer in the unit and when I accidentally left some special items in the dryer they even mailed them back to me.  Thank you for the great stay.
51021341,676865570340704822,2022-07-22,107801423,Mackenzie,"Such a unique, historical, and fun place to stay in downtown Salem. You are so close to wonderful food and shopping, all while having a ton of privacy. The space was so spacious and comfortable."
51021341,688512770487991850,2022-08-07,54517935,Laura,One of the most communicative host I have ever had and extremely great location :) the overall stay was very comfortable and we would definitely come again.
51021341,700815041537615724,2022-08-24,15399936,Jenny,"Angela answered the phone immediately when we had trouble figuring out where it was (our fault, we’d been driving for 10 hours and didn’t see the clearly labeled door in front of us) and was super accommodating when I needed to check out a bit later. The location is great, lots of restaurants nearby and right by the waterfront park. Easy 10 minute walk to Willamette. Very clean and comfortable!"
51021341,710240995905594108,2022-09-06,248908778,Septa,We absolutely loved staying at the Tiger Station loft. The large windows and ample space made the place feel so comfortable and relaxing. The proximity to tons of local restaurants and bars was also fantastic. We walked everywhere! <br/><br/>The biggest plus was probably the fenced in parking spot. Our vehicle felt so safe!
51021341,718893297885441137,2022-09-18,8370397,Jo,"Awesome location, large apartment with ample amenities. Highly recommend!"
51021341,729807177809728090,2022-10-03,76092549,Marti,"The Loft was very convenient for us, and it was great having a washer and dryer.<br/>The stairway is steep and long, about 20 steps up. <br/>The description we read said there are two bedrooms. There are two beds, but one of them is in the entrance  hall, and someone in the bedroom has to walk by it on the way to the bathroom. We only used the bed in the bedroom, so this was not an issue for us. But it may be for others who need to use both beds."
51021341,731282073130640685,2022-10-05,231376344,Michael,"Great, cozy apartment in the heart of the downtown area. Tons of great shops and food to walk to. Loved it."

51021341,737723450613381234,2022-10-14,22410989,Alexander,Angela was a great host! Very easy to communicate with and she was accommodating. We had a really great time staying in this apartment. The location was really amazing with over a dozen restaurants and cafes within 1 to 3 blocks. The space was also very clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay there again!
51021341,739236132294584760,2022-10-16,81573760,Eireann,"Lovely place to stay, great location, and big apartment! Just fyi, (we did not check the pictures closely enough) there is only one bedroom. The other bed is in the living room."
51021341,832709702347102684,2023-02-22,29134945,Molly,Angela was such a great host! She was very responsive to any questions. The apartment is super cute and felt even bigger then the photos. It was also a convenient walk to the convention center for me. Angela was also sweet enough to let me park my car there past checkout which was very kind!
51022955,422444716012702141,2021-08-05,101852026,Barbara,"The bunkhouse is a gem -- very comfy and cozy and in a truly lovely location.  The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom is spacious.  There is nice outdoor patio with table and chairs for dining.  As advertised, there isn't really a kitchen per se.  If you can make do with light meals/salads/sandwiches, it will work for you.  If you like to cook (as we do), it doesn't have cooking facilities beyond a toaster oven and microwave.  We were treated to fresh figs from the garden!  This would make a fabulous place for a retreat or romantic getaway."
51022955,425386474519922632,2021-08-09,248735976,Ana,The Bunkhouse was a great place to stay. Away from the crowds and cozy.  The view was amazing.  Enjoyed having coffee and dinner on the porch.  Carole was great at accommodating and communication was excellent.
51022955,427510376154963439,2021-08-12,402317927,David,"Very professional and Courteous, highly recommend!"
51022955,443538850145912052,2021-09-03,77806316,Mary,Quiet and cozy
51022955,447800896577745378,2021-09-09,63661080,Katy,"This place is charming and on a large, peaceful nature reserve. I enjoyed the restful 3 days I spent here. That said, there were a few unpleasant surprises: <br/>* The listing mentioned there were roller shades on the windows, however there were no window coverings at all. The bunkhouse is on the first floor on a shared property, so privacy was not guaranteed and there was no way to completely darken the room for sleep.<br/>* A large guard dog lives on the porch of the main house. It ran at me barking on the first day but luckily was on leash. No harm done, but that's the kind of thing I'd expect to be mentioned in a listing."
51022955,449971992580127326,2021-09-12,344458783,Aaron,"Pretty cool spot for adventure if your an outdoor person, you can leave your stuff and explore and come back like nothing. Safe little get away but only one thing is there is a big window in front of the bed which is kinda creepy but other than that it was a lovely stay . Would come back!"
51022955,481173222872616593,2021-10-25,89024208,William,Rustic in a unique location. Very good communication by the host. Best to arrive in daylight.
51022955,483400936551683017,2021-10-28,13281397,Nyla,"This is a pleasant hideaway in an area you wouldn't know about but which is actually quite close to town.  Some folks have written about the exposed windows.  It's fine.  This is a private property, gated even, and being able to look out on the grounds is part of the charm.<br/><br/>The bed is comfortable.  The hot water plentiful. The quiet, broken by birds and the wind, healing.  Forget trying to use the internet.  Sketchy isn't the word for it.  It simply isn't there.  But if you are able to unplug or use your own hotspot (which is what I did) you'll be fine."
51022955,486277474183518052,2021-11-01,422426405,Holly,"I enjoyed the cute, homey bunkhouse, and the surroundings are absolutely beautiful."
51022955,490678466765895363,2021-11-07,79166844,Laura,you are not walking to anything and you are not cooking anything.  it is charming and quaint and I really liked it.
51022955,492131745881284471,2021-11-09,245508447,Chandra,Had a great time and it was a really great location. Fair warning though there is a giant window without blinds that face the house on the property. A little chilly the first night because the fireplace takes a while to warm up the space but once it does it’s super warm and cozy. The heated blanket also helped but we didn’t see it until the last night. Other than that the property was very beautiful and totally encapsulates what I wanted to show my boyfriend for his first time coming to my hometown. I definitely recommend this place for nature lovers!!
51022955,497153888323993845,2021-11-16,207658069,Heather,"Comfy bed, beautiful grounds!"
51022955,505142064617395558,2021-11-27,52133264,Mrs,"This is a beautiful rustic country setting, and the grounds are beyond beautiful, perfect for us.  If your a everything must be perfect kind of person, then this place isn’t for you.  My husband was training for a Ironman race and found the trails next door perfect for biking and running, I’m unable to walk much and found the stream and birds wonderful to watch from the front porch."
51022955,537014744241352737,2022-01-10,432563459,Guy,"beautiful property, I visited in January and got to see all sorts of wildlife out on the river"
51022955,540593170470008588,2022-01-15,439295425,Natalie,"The area was beautiful, and it was a nice place to stay for a few nights. However, the internet connection was absolutely awful - we couldn't use it at all - and there are no curtains on the massive bay windows that face the house, taking away the illusion of privacy. The guests are also required to wash their own dishes at the end of their stay, which is odd considering the $50 cleaning fee, and also meant the dishes weren't very clean before we even used them. Lastly, there's a door off the bathroom that leads into a storage room and visibly towards the upstars, and it doesnt lock. We could hear people moving around upstairs and in the room and that made us a little uncomfortable. Otherwise it was a nice stay."

There are definitely curtains in the bay window, and the bay window doesn't directly face the main house, as mentioned by a few other visitors. The internet is a little slow, but it works just fine for sending emails and quick web surfing. The dog mentioned in one of the comments does bark, but Peaches gets used to your presence after a day or two and stops barking. She's a good pup. I loved the grounds, the landscaping, the yard art and statues, and the morning fog. Great place."

The location is great with quick access to beautiful Minto Park for a walk or bike ride. If I had any questions, my host was quick to respond. If your up for a cozy - rustic adventure, this is a great place."

House smelled like a cellar, dank and musty. Shower needs a non slip mat. Angie is difficult to please, argumentative and non welcoming"

Older home with narrow floor plan. Tight stairs to the second floor.<br/><br/>Livingroom and kitchen was excellent and modern.

Everything  was spotless. Neighbors were friendly. The only (minor) issue was that we were there in the summer and the upstairs bedrooms didn't quite get full AC. But the fans were very helpful.

51104836,670315064804991690,2022-07-13,348478755,Kim,"By far, the nicest place I’ve stayed and Debbie is an amazing host.

51104836,853747633973971819,2023-03-23,3464931,Amanda & Tasha,"In a pinch, we needed a night to stay in for a procedure. The initial listing had been booked while in communication about the listing’s location (important for us for what we were in the area for), she offered another listing that wasn’t open at the time. We were grateful that Debbie was willing to open up dates for that listing. <br/><br/>Check in was super easy, we were greeted by the pups and a kitty. She was very friendly and accommodating giving us house rules when it came to the pets and we were sure to ensure the pets safety during our stay. Her space was beautiful and super clean from the common areas to the listing of two rooms with a Jack and Jill bathroom joining the two rooms. The bathroom had two doors that opens to each room so privacy is still present should you book the rooms with intentions of having two separate sleeping arrangements. I am unsure if the the doors locked from the bathroom. The beds were comfy and one of the rooms had a tv with a couch.<br/><br/>A perfect Airbnb."

The place is beautiful, great for dogs, and very comfortable. The neighborhood is great for walking (you can walk to Safeway and a bar), it was super quiet and also close to I-5. I worked while I was there and wi-fi is strong and reliable. You also have your choice of many streaming services on TV!"

The place is super clean with plenty of space and while we can only speak to the master bedroom, the bed/pillows/bedding was super comfy. For TV viewers, there was access to Netflix, prime video, Hulu, etc… There’s also a great workspace with 2 monitors for those on work travel.  Very easy checkin process and our host was very attentive throughout the stay. We would definitely book this place again."

We left a night early as soon as we were able to secure alternate accommodations for the weekend. Traveler beware!

This Airbnb was the perfect location for those wanting to be within a close drive to the venue but have all the comforts of home.

It was a perfect location, we even hit the Willamette Vineyards one day (10 min via Uber!). Very close to shopping (.8 mile) and restaurants. Ray’s home exceeded our expectations. It was extremely clean, beautifully constructed and nicely decorated. Kitchen has almost anything you need/want (we even made a roast in the Instant Pot one night!) if you prefer eating in vs out. Master bath/shower is awesome and beds were very comfortable. Beware, drive is pretty steep, but there is alternative parking on the street that is flatter. We would go back to Ray’s place in the future, should we return to the area."

Just a note for anyone traveling with an older dog., The stairs are not carpeted and are manufactured wood so they are slippery for paws be prepared You may have to carry fur babies up and down the stairs"
51268205,689954360953755415,2022-08-09,125079165,Stephany,"Our stay was amazing! The townhome was very spacious, clean, check in was smooth."
51268205,705815576319203903,2022-08-31,454940268,Ginger,"We had a fantastic relaxing stay, just what we needed. The place was roomy, beautiful, and clean. For our needs we were centrally located to all the places we needed to go. About 10 to 15 minutes from Downtown Salem and Willamette University. Loved having a kitchen and washer & dryer. Seating out on the back patio area would have been nice, to be honest it was too hot most of the time to have been able to take full advantage of that. Communication with Ray and Tammy was easy and they were very responsive and helpful. The place is close to grocery stores and basically anything you might need to stock the pantry. The place was as described in the advertisement. Except I wouldn’t say the 3rd room has a twin bed I would describe it as a full size bed. There is a TV for streaming and a few card/board games. Dinning room table fits 6 easily. We can’t wait to go back.<br/><br/><br/>Things to do:  <br/><br/>You must go and visit the Silver Falls Park, pack a picnic lunch and plan to stay all day, it’s incredibly beautiful and about a 30 minute drive give or take. The Gordon House (Frank Lloyd Wright last house he designed) was the next stop, and then Willamette Valley pies was the last stop on our way back to the Air B&B, and well worth it, for a piece of pie.  We got an apple hand pie, Marion berry (Blackberry) hand pie, and a slice of Strawberry Rhubarb pie, they were all delicious..<br/><br/>The Yard food truck park was also a wonderful find lots of different types of food, wine, beer, and full bar. <br/><br/>Cozy Taverna is a wonderful tapas restaurant with a full bar in Downtown Salem everything we ate there was amazing. The goat cheese dumplings were to die for, you well need some garlic bread to sop up the sauce you will want to get every last drop. Squid ink pasta you must eat it all there, we had some leftover and reheating it later just wasn’t nearly as good as it was fresh.  Flourless chocolate cake and the French Toast Desserts were heavenly. We did have some of the French Toast dessert leftover which was very yummy for breakfast the next morning. <br/><br/>Wild Pear is a small little cafe also in Downtown Salem it was great for lunch with a variety of food. My husband had a roast beef and blue cheese sandwich with fries, our daughter had the veggie wrap with half/half sweet potato and regular fries, and I had the heirloom tomato sandwich with the steak chili soup. We were all very happy with our meals. <br/><br/>Sassy Onion was a great brunch spot walking distance from Willamette University/Willamette Heritage Center. There our daughter had the berry french toast (blueberries and strawberries), you can get it with just one type of berries if you prefer. It did not need any syrup, but they have maple and marion berry if you have a sweeter tooth than us. I had their biscuits and gravy with bacon (reminded me of my Granny’s). My husband had the mess in a skillet (you can get it as a burrito as well) he had left overs (which is not like him), that was okay because I got to finish it off the next day for breakfast and it was delicious. <br/><br/>Roger that Barbecue was another great eatery. Check for their operating hours, closing time occurs when they run out of meat or at the posted closing time which ever happens first. They have a two meat combo with the choice of two sides. One combo feeds two people (trust me). My husband didn’t believe me or the staff and insisted on getting two combos and we had lots of leftovers. But there was no complaining about that since the pork ribs and beef brisket was amazingly delicious. The ribs fell off the bone and you didn’t need a knife to cut the brisket. I suggest you get the beans as one of your sides. The kick it up corn was mild with not much flavor, fries and tater tots were good. <br/><br/>We went to a couple wineries while we were visiting as well, both very lovely. Bethel Heights Vineyards and Bjornson Winery.<br/><br/>Bjornson we sat out on the balcony with beautiful views and stayed there for about 3 hours enjoying the tasting, views and meat and cheese plate we ordered. <br/><br/>Bethel  Heights we sat inside (Because the shaded spots outside were taken).  Not certain if they offered food or not, we had just eaten so we didn’t ask. We stayed for about two hours. Worth a call to ask about food or if you can bring your own. <br/><br/>There are many more things to do and see lots of good food around and of course a trip to Portland is only about an hour away. <br/><br/>Hope everyone who stays here enjoys it as much as we did."

He has been the most gracious host for any location that we have stayed.  We almost always use Airbnb when we travel so we have a lot of experience with hosts.  Ray is the BEST.<br/><br/>If you want a great place to stay and a great host to work with, this is your place!"

51268205,845744490594539886,2023-03-12,83526082,Jill,"The place was as described.  The yard was small and nearly completely bark dust, which was nice as it prevented mud, but tracked in if you BBQued, so be prepared to sweep if its dry or damp mop if its raining.  Ray and Tammy were responsive and very accommodating.  Their instruction book held all we needed to know.  Lots of children in the neighborhood who were very friendly as well."

Personal parking space, private entrance through a tranquil little garden area, cozy neighborhood vibe, and a very clean and comfortable space to work and relax in for the week. Had all the necessary amenities with some awesome extra perks, having dedicated laundry for the Airbnb on site was great too. Can’t do any better for the affordable price point too, highly recommend!"

The neighborhood was quiet.  Everything worked and was as expected. <br/><br/>Having a glass of wine upon arrival by the pond was the perfect respite after a day of travel. As was the last cup of coffee this morning!<br/><br/>We’ll be back again!!!"
51332824,437027939608966573,2021-08-25,30023569,Cheryl,"Hidden Treasure was a travelers treat!  I was dropping off my daughter at Willamette University.  B & B was located about 10 minutes away in the hills of Salem.  The neighborhood is quiet and really pretty.  Good to see more of Salem’s neighborhoods.  Don had everything covered for our visited.  He  went above and beyond to make us feel welcome, safe and comfortable."
51332824,448617459479186906,2021-09-10,416739712,Tyler,"This is a great place to stay for a resonable price. Just across the river from downtown its a quick drive to anywhere in Salem and the surrounding area. My only complaint, which is no fault of the owner, would be that there are a few quite steep hills to get up to the house. The owners are friendly and checked in through airbnb or in person when we saw each other outside."

(With things like coasters and super soft tissues in every room, throws to snuggle up with, coffee and oatmeal… the list goes on!) Super easy parking. Felt so safe and secure with the locking system and motion light. Truly an incredible value. We will never stay anywhere else in Salem. Hidden Treasure is what this is. The best of Airbnb in this little hideaway."

51332824,510931613223901834,2021-12-05,82565166,Kris,"This quaint little spot in west salem was like having a hotel suite! Everything was very clean. The living space has a gas fireplace that makes the time there very cozy. They have lots of movies and books to enjoy as well as satellite tv.  The bathroom is spacious with everything you need in case you forgot something. Kitchen is well equipped for dining in if you choose to do so. It wasn’t quite warm enough for us to enjoy the nice little outside area with a small water hole and trickling water that I totally would have enjoyed sitting by while reading a good book, but if I’m ever in the area in warmer weather… I look forward to that quaint spot for all guests."

Beautiful setting, comfortable bed and furniture and a great little kitchenette that had everything I needed. One note for temperature sensitive folks is that the temperature is not adjustable but there is an extra fan, space heater, and fireplace to adapt as needed. I found it quite comfortable and the bottle of wine was a lovely gesture!"

Incredibly spacious and comfortable with so many great amenities and attention to detail. We visit family in Salem at least once a year and have stayed in many Airbnbs all around town, but this one definitely ranked one of the highest. The only wonky (and very minor) thing is that the hot/cold settings are backwards on all of the faucets. Not a big deal once you realize it, but it always threw me off when I went to brush my teeth... The patio  with the charming pond/foundation is such a wonderful space to relax in!"
51332824,715334473727701146,2022-09-13,185175057,Tamera,"Don was a perfect host, warm and welcoming. This is a gem of a place- having all we needed for a lovely private retreat. We appreciated and enjoyed the quality of the amenities as well as the accessibility to town and country. We’ll definitely use  this  cozy, well situated home for our out-of-town guests."

51332824,737795491649613079,2022-10-14,147769623,Kineret,"Our experience was a bit mixed. We were greeted with a great wine bottle, that was definitely a great treat. The place was spacious and cozy, and met most of our needs. Nonetheless, the internet reception was bad most of the time, and some of the utilities (towels, for example) were worn out, others of bad quality (garbage bags, toilet paper). In addition, there were no toddler accommodations available for our 4 y/o."

Me and my family are on a road trip from Whibey island to Redding, CA we thought we could drive straight through but it’s a little harder with kids. So it was a last minute stay which she had no problem adjusting it for us and for that we are thankful! Her husband offered us coffee in the morning is was pleasant stay for last minute and very roomy for our family of 4."

The tent and accommodations were exactly as described. I really enjoyed talking to her about travel experiences and other topics. Her kids are great and so is their sweet dog too. This is a great place at a great value in the Salem area for anyone needing to pay less money than a hotel costs. I would definitely recommend it to anyone needing  a place to crash. :)

51909986,810950002531827362,2023-01-23,26771675,Nickle,"The view of the river was very cool. I could sip on coffee (provided by the host) and look out at the greenbelt and water flowing by. The town is very walkable and I took a foot bridge over the water, and found McMinnimans to have some dinner.  Then I walked downtown which only took 15 minutes. The place was clean and well stocked full of anything you needed for a long stay."

52354445,671114143435369934,2022-07-14,54753319,Candace,Our stay was excellent! The host was very responsive and the location was a perfect home base for our group in town for the Ironman.  The description of the property was very accurate and we found it to be  a good value.  Very clean and well stocked!  Even enough room to comfortably store our bikes for a week! Thank you!
52354445,672588014757353676,2022-07-16,346128721,Holly,This was a clean and easy place to stay.   It was fun being right on the creek and hearing the water running.  Host instructions were also easy to follow.  Our only complaint was the shower was slow to drain… seems to be old water pipes.
52354445,680447413356421439,2022-07-27,117951908,Ethan,It was a very nice stay. We were in and out because we were only in town for an event but it was in a central location and the space was comfortable.
52354445,683406485258675104,2022-07-31,139541922,M,"Creek view and quiet upstairs unit made for a nice stay in downtown Salem. Amanda was great to work with, quick to answer any questions we had."
52354445,689931482233364485,2022-08-09,131709680,Beverly J,"This apartment is a wonderful Airbnb to stay in. It’s roomy, very clean, and well supplied with towels and dishes. It also has a creek running along the back of the complex. I loved being on the porch watching the water. We heard it at night while we slept. It’s close to the downtown area and the Saturday Market.  Excellent hosts."
52354445,692120756449955444,2022-08-12,12711872,Lisa,"If you like being near water, this is a rental you should definitely consider! The sound of it was so relaxing and there's a great covered balcony right over the creek. Very clean space, quiet complex, and super comfortable. Would stay again! Thank you!"
52354445,692868255284287862,2022-08-13,213333791,James,pretty cozy spot especially with the creek flowing right there from back patio.
52354445,695021977284099125,2022-08-16,61366509,Cloé,"We had a nice time at Amanda's apartment. It is actually much bigger than it looks on the photo. There is everything you need to feel comfortable, with a nice terrace that is above a river which gives a sweet sound at night. Amanda was a good host and is easy to communicate with."
52354445,696467162596570461,2022-08-18,25364222,Rob,Really enjoyed the stream while drinking coffee. Very spacious and would stay here again!
52354445,698662579490101646,2022-08-21,196212224,Cassandra,"The beds were SO comfy! The whole placed was clean and well maintained with nice dishes, coffee maker and much more.  The river running was very pleasant.  Our host had great communication and you could tell she really cared about our experience."
52354445,700797945267791911,2022-08-24,5167676,Annette,"The apartment was older, as stated but clean and well-stocked with some nice extra touches like makeup wipes, lotion and coffee. The sound of the creek outside is wonderful and our apartment was quite private with a nice view, being at the top floor end. The only issues that would keep me from renting again were the cigarette smoke from the full-time tenant below- which could be smelled from inside the apartment, and the homeless group camped out on the sidewalk less than a 1/2 block from the apartment. I know that goes with being in downtown Salem and comes with the territory."
52354445,704361731634137900,2022-08-29,369177984,Gabriel,"Amanda is a great host; thoughtful, communicative, and responsive. My stay at her quiet creek side get away was a very pleasant, relaxing experience."

52354445,792170028099629857,2022-12-28,270811651,Louanne,Thanks Amanda for a comfortable convenient place to stay on our trip to Salem. 👍🏻💕

52354445,797225010431680612,2023-01-04,195745433,Laura,"My partner and I absolutely loved this apartment. We will definitely be coming back for future stays in Oregon, hopefully for longer stays!<br/><br/>The sound of the creek right outside the balcony is really soothing, it’s a great place to get some fresh air throughout the day. Check-in was super easy and smooth, and Amanda was responsive and helpful. We had everything we needed in the apartment with extra linens and towels to spare.<br/><br/>We wouldn’t necessarily recommend to wander around nearby alone at night, as it’s a pretty active area where some people are unfortunately having to live outside. Just an fyi. But everyone we came across directly there was very friendly and respectful!<br/><br/>Heating was easy in the winter. We were a 10 to 15 minute walk from everything we needed to access downtown. Can’t recommend enough as a more affordable but still quite cozy stay in Salem."
52354445,797934244716601230,2023-01-05,451398290,Ayden,"Amanda was a lovely host to a lovely place. It was private, cleanly, comfy and overall just a great place to stay"
52354445,807358553321607437,2023-01-18,489029461,Briany,"Enjoyed my stay, everything was close by and the area felt safe despite being downtown. Most importantly, our host was very welcoming and attentive during, before and after our stay. Definitely would book again."
52354445,809598065465251349,2023-01-21,50692685,Audrea,"Great place to stay while my husband had to work in Salem. I work from home and was able to work here while my husband was down here for his work. <br/>Super convenient location, easy check in and great communication with owner. <br/>This is an older property but mostly updated. Bed was super comfortable and going to sleep with the sound of the creek is wonderful. Looks exactly like the photos, everything you need for a comfortable stay. Definitely recommend."
52354445,811019364328738993,2023-01-23,294407144,Patricia,"We enjoyed our stay! Honestly one of the cleanest Airbnb's we have stayed in :) <br/>Easy to find, covered parking, and a balcony that overlooks a creek. Going to sleep and waking up to the sound of the creek was divine!"
52354445,814575348480478622,2023-01-28,50692685,Audrea,Very nice place to stay. This is our third time staying at one of Amanda's properties. This is a very nice unit. Looks exactly like the photos. Very nice with the river running on two sides of the unit. And super comfy bed. Plus the location is super convenient. Would certainly recommend to anyone looking to stay in the Salem area.
52354445,816045675035234014,2023-01-30,395374577,Ellen,Amanda and Brenda were super communicative! We loved that we could bring our animals. What a perk! I’m glad we finally found a weekend when they weren’t booked!
52354445,818231843764542975,2023-02-02,430233376,Lillian,Super easy to get to and get around from. Loved being able to hear the water at night.
52354445,818916636970759110,2023-02-03,161298361,Natalie,The place was as described and a good value for a two bedroom place. Convenient location and easy check in. Thoughtful toiletries and supplies were provided. The bed was comfortable. Not a fancy place but very functional and the creek was a nice addition.
52354445,832682725417630046,2023-02-22,349333516,Crystal,"Quiet, clean and comfortable! This little apartment was within walking distance to where we needed to be downtown for business. Private and all around wonderful. Thank you!"
52354445,834145892023638880,2023-02-24,133451070,Katy,"I always enjoy staying at this location.  this was the first time for me in this particular apartment, though.  I found it to be just as nice as the others but even more private.   I appreciate the parking set up and save money by leaving my car here and walking to work.   I recommend any of the apartments at this location, but I will be on the lookout for this specific one in my future stays."
52354445,834921697054790145,2023-02-25,206981397,Brent,"Amanda was a very responsive host - there was construction scheduled for the unit we booked, so she was able to arrange another unit and kept us in the loop the whole time. The place was easy to find and instructions were clear.  The running brook was louder than I expected but it was quite pleasant to listen to at night!  Thank you, Amanda!"
52354445,843606866864769543,2023-03-09,142307475,Erik,Visited Salem for work. This unit was exactly what I needed.
52354445,850045625603482180,2023-03-18,139893381,Patty,"Located in a very close proximity to services, shopping in downtown Salem.  The water was delightful off the balcony as there had been lots of rain which made for roaring rushing water background noise.  Access and parking are good, everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful.  If your looking for a great location to enjoy Salem from this could be a great pick."
52354445,855127435773045437,2023-03-25,445609639,Nolan,"This place is amazing. Loved being by the creek. Outdoor space looks right over it. It’s close to town, and we walked everywhere. We traveled with our lab, and Amanda was very accommodating."

The beds were comfortable, and everything was clean. Aimee was an excellent host, I would recommend this stay to friends or family."

53256374,496392830888516161,2021-11-15,49123402,Shelby,"If you are a four star hotel person, this might not be your spot. It is a quirky spot in a 120 year old house. But if you want space and a great value with everything you need, you will be pleased. Easy location to get to downtown, hospital, Willamette capital, and major Salem arterials. Really comfortable mattress. easy parking. <br/><br/>You can hear some normal noise from other unit in building, and may hear a train, but we had a nice quiet stay. Amanda was great with communication."
53256374,530526904542703830,2022-01-01,189555132,Ariel,"I stayed here for a full month while in town for work. This is a wonderful place. It is incredibly spacious, cozy, and has a lot of great touches. My favorite part was the full kitchen and the giant couch."
53256374,595735456627870686,2022-04-01,179847840,Taylor,"Located in a quiet, quaint neighborhood with blooming flowers and friendly neighbors, this historic home was just what we needed for our Salem stay. We stayed for 2 months and worked at the hospital, a 4 minute drive. It is a spacious 2 bedroom apartment with a large kitchen and easily accessible laundry in the basement. The fireplace/furnace was our favorite feature! Parking was not an issue on the street or shared driveway. Continently located minutes from grocery stores, restaurants, and wineries. Only 30 minutes to waterfalls and 1.5 hours to the coast! Great stay, Amanda was always available for questions and left the kitchen stocked with coffee and teas."
53256374,663053618273954637,2022-07-03,433162715,Jamie,This place was in a great location and a very good neighborhood. Amanda and Kevin were very mindful of my work schedule when doing repairs on the space above me. Amanda was always quick to answer any questions. I highly recommend staying here.
53256374,749310174497332265,2022-10-30,25702844,Chris,Perfect location for a concert in downtown Salem. Walking distance to the Elsinore and near by bars / restaurants.<br/><br/>Apartment was clean and comfy. Just what was needed.

Cynthia is easy to communicate with and quick responds, my folks enjoyed their stay, comfortable bed, at a quiet neighborhood near by Bush park, great for neighborhood walk. When I picked my parents up, they already wanted to be back next time when they’re in Salem again."
53546584,526105035642632738,2021-12-26,123682310,Stanislav,"Lovely stay in a cozy authentic style house! Located close to the city center and two blocks away from a big park. Very pleasant and welcoming host with a cute and super friendly cat. The room was spacious for two people, clean and warm. It is on the first floor as well as the bathroom. One can tell that it was very well sanitized and cleaned extra following some strict COVID protocol. Since it was Christmas, Cynthia put the fireplace on, which gave this house some extra charm. Big living room with a nice comfortable sofa was offered to us as a place we could hang out in the evening and watch some TV. All in all, we found good value in this place and, certainly, won't hesitate to stay there again in the future!"

It's obvious that she's put a lot of thought into making her guests feel welcome.

Double bonus: the great Mexican restaurant just a few blocks away."

The blinds kept the sun out and we had a great sleep in a comfy bed. The bathroom is outside the room but the host is very respectful of space and was open to allowing access to her kitchen and refrigerator for storage. Good neighborhood.

The room was of good value and clean. If you don’t like cats, Ember will make sure you do by the time you leave. She had quite the personality on her and is so sweet. Just ask my GF.

The room itself is spacious. Enough bed to stretch out, a big desk to work at, and a good closet. The Internet is plenty fast for streaming, so I imagine that Zoom calls would be fine. The house is cute. I really liked how there are grab bars in the bathroom. It's a nice, thoughtful touch for those who may not be the most steady in the shower or getting up from the toilet. Cynthia is friendly and very helpful, too!"

I noticed the iris artwork on the walls and she told me they were her favorites.  what caught my attention was the way the light was captured. gorgeous. I hope to take a class with you.

Expect nothing but the best because that is what you will definitely receive. I was in the area on a travel nurse contract and I was more upset I had to leave such a peaceful place.

I appreciated the room's natural light and view of the tops of the surrounding trees. The location was excellent; about a walkable mile from downtown and half a mile from a grocery store. Tauren and Mikos were great hosts; great communication and very accommodating. This is the place to stay in Salem 👍
54093080,763900397914216977,2022-11-19,395943021,Nakia,I stayed here on a travel assignment for 3 months and it was absolutely peaceful and made me feel very safe. My room had a beautiful view over looking a garden which was great to wake up to. The house is kept tidy and the roommates were all very pleasant and easy to get along with. Most of them worked at the hospital I worked at so it was great being able to live with like minded professionals. If I ever come back to Salem I will definitely request to stay here again and again 😊

54093259,652247633968957819,2022-06-18,446720888,Santario,This place is literally a hidden gem! The location is great. The owners are amazing. If you are worried about shared housing don’t be! Most here are nurses or in the medical field and always busy so you rarely see anyone in the house. Everything you need is here and if it’s not the owners will get what ever to make you comfortable. The place is always clean and everyone is respectful.
54093259,772540531372473279,2022-12-01,75654248,Tyler,I’ve stayed at a lot of AirBnb’s and this has been my favorite. Highly recommend.

54093296,596427599171421934,2022-04-02,126145881,Missy,"This was the perfect place to stay while in Salem. The house was clean, spacious and everything you could need was provided. Although the common space was shared with others, there was plenty of storage in kitchen for food, etc. and the space was well thought out so that you can spend time with other people staying there or find a quiet area for yourself.  Tauren was very responsive to any needs that came while I was staying here!  I’ve stayed at several air bnbs while in Salem and this was the best one by far!"
54093296,683348617096950162,2022-07-31,10158270,Evan,Tauren has created quite the place here. The home is gorgeous and super well done. Tauren is very responsive and a great communicator.
54093317,596373146603978709,2022-04-02,388156130,Wendy,"This is a beautiful, clean home. I travel for work and stayed there for a few weeks. There are a lot of things to do with hiking, and being  an hour from the coast/Portland, shopping and restaurants. Tauren takes the time to make sure you are comfortable and keeping the place in tiptop condition. Kings donut (get there early) and Word of mouth restaurant are worth going to. Also the tap room is a unique experience with good food. I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Oregon."

The beds, in particular, were super plush and comfy, which makes for good nights’ sleep after days of traveling. The kitchen and bathroom were well stocked, everything was in working order, and having a washer and dryer was a huge plus after a few days on the road. Check-in and check-out were super easy, and the hosts were unfailingly communicative and responsive with instructions and questions. We had a great stay and would recommend the place to anyone."

54095800,668920640263703359,2022-07-11,156111640,Sarah,"Renae's place was exceptionally clean, affordable, and conveniently located to downtown. We were in town for the Oregon Ironman- we had plenty of space for our gear and a full kitchen for our meal prep. The space is extremely close to a very busy road which made it incredibly disruptive and hard to sleep. Make sure you bring a noise machine and/or ear plugs-- despite us both being very sound sleepers, it was extremely difficult to block out the constant traffic even into the early hours of the morning."

Your place is peaceful especially that I am sleeping during day time. It is also clean and it seems all is brand new.  I was able to cook and lundry my clothes too. These are two plus factors for me in renting an accommodation coz not all offers the same.<br/><br/>I would surely recommend your place for a place to stay and I would surely comeback and rent text time.

54298325,617424111045128670,2022-05-01,179413718,Humberto,"I stayed in room 3 at Oleg's place from April 27th - May 1st. I booked this stay last minute because I was going to be doing wild fire training near Salem.<br/>On arrival I was expecting to find a stay that would be part of a house where the owners were there too. My expectations were not accurate since I did not really plan in a timely manner. The house is shared by othet guests staying there. So, the atmosphere is more like staying with roomates from college vs staying with a friend hosting your stay. <br/>Quiet hours are from 10 PM to 7 AM. I was not aware of this the first night but Oleg did a great job of communicating that to me. When I arrived there were two other guests staying there. <br/>We all pretty much minded ourselves. Despite my best efforts to be respectful. I found me being to loud at times for one of the prior guests. I did my best to enjoy my stay while still respecting other's enjlying there's Overall it was great place to stay if you need somewhere to lay your head at night. It's well cleaned. Has a washer and dryer. A kitchen with basic cookware, ample parking, and is located in a quiet safe suburbian neighborhood. <br/><br/>I would go again if I just need a simple place to stay. :))"

The house is so spacious and was perfect for our Bbq dinner we hosted as a rehearsal for our wedding. Everyone loved their comfortable rooms and each one had a bathroom to get ready in.

It’s in the basement of their home and they were there to greet us w their two beautiful babies.  The bed and pillows could be more comfortable for our liking, but it was only one night so it worked!"

Loads of extras and Tiffany was great to communicate with. <br/>I only slept there one night so I didn’t utilize all of the amenities.

The kitchen is small and not very functional for more than a day or 2. But the projector and fireplace are downright fantastic! Love the funky decor and all the bedding is so comfortable. Very nice neighborhood. Would come back again for a movie night!

I was 10 min from the hospital I worked at so the location was great! It is a basement apartment so it could be a little noisy if you work Night Shift, but other than that there were no issues! Compared to my friends renting in salem, it was slightly more money each month, but nothing major. I’d say it was worth it. Hosts are very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again!! I can’t say enough great things about it."
573939723498729158,618956068322847579,2022-05-03,422466584,Kelly,"This was one of my favorite airbnbs that I've stayed in. Rachel put together a truly cozy place that was fully stocked and with many added details that were thoughtful. For example, there is a sound machine in the bedroom that plays nature sounds, there is a heated blanket. She included games, books, and even feed for the birds and squirrels outside. It was fun to watch the critters eat from the bedroom window or living room. Rachel also communicated well about any questions we had. Great location, very quite at night good neighborhood for jogging. Thank you!"

It is also very comfortable.  The bed is very nice, the shower is great with plenty of hot water.

583694758993198434,693502660098492749,2022-08-14,894209,Jinny,"Roddy's is a fabulous place to stay. We were in Salem with other family members  for our son's wedding at a nearby winery. There is a ton of space and it provides plenty of privacy for those of us who go to bed early. The loft area upstairs was perfect for our bouncy, not so quiet grandkids. There was lots of space for us to congregate in the open kitchen and dining area and the unique plumbing and lighting fixtures were one of the highlights on our stay. Check in was simple. I would definitely choose Roddy's place again."

It is in a nice neighborhood and had plenty of space, and the hosts were incredibly kind and responsive to our needs. Having said that, the house did not appear to be clean on arrival (dirty linens/bedspreads, fingerprints on counters/tables, crumbs on the floor, cobwebs, etc. , and has some updating that needs to be done. The cleaning crew also crossed paths with my family on the day of checkout and were extremely rude and aggressive towards my mother for simply standing on the porch."

This is a great place for families or a group of friends to gather. The hosts are amazing and very quick with communication. This is one of my favorite homes to stay at in Salem. Batman fans will appreciate the Batman bedroom. The basement has a really fun big room for families to hang out in.

The house is very nice but there’s a lot of holes and chipped painting. The air mattresses were also no where to be found.

583694758993198434,790650531946588639,2022-12-26,391402395,Wendy,"I'm sorry to say there was not heat in the basement to heat two bedrooms, one bathroom and a main room.  That left the bottom half of the house unusable during Christmas.  One burner on the stove didn't work.  Kitchen not stocked for 10-16 people.  Sidewalk icy when we arrived - very slippery.<br/>Roddy did give me a bit of a refund which helps but it is obvious  the house is not monitored to be sure everything is ready for guests."

583694758993198434,850099627438951589,2023-03-18,58221333,Stacey,Roddys place didn’t come without some downsides. For one. There is no actual designated work space so if that is a requirement there isn’t one at this time. Maybe one will be added in the future. <br/><br/>This is definitely phase 1 of a luxury home but the host has other homes that are luxurious and beautiful and I have no doubt this one will get there in time. Also the host is amazingly friendly and gracious. And when any issues arose the host took care of them quickly. <br/><br/>There are toys for children to play with which was a really nice thing to see. My son loved the train track and called this “Batman’s” house our entire stay.

Perfect for a family of four to stay for a couple of days. There was a safeway close by so it was helpful. Price was also reasonable. The environment with garden and flower beds added to the tranquility.

The place was open, neat and clean! Convenient to downtown Salem and destinations around the area.<br/>My sister and I went for a walk about the neighborhood the 1st night it looked a little sketchy, but most houses around were well kept up and we did feel safe.<br/>Bryan had plenty of plateware, silverware, pots and pans to use with a full kitchen. He also had a dishwasher and all supplies needed to use. He also has a washer and dryer with supplies! What else can you ask for. The shower had good pressure and the beds were quite comfortable.<br/>We did make a few suggestions for him for future guests, and he said he would take this into consideration, so he is open.<br/>I would highly recommend Bryan's home! He had a nice backyard and a little barbecue to enjoy outside privately as he had the means to do so!"

There were games and books available and signing in to our streaming accounts was seamless. My friends stopped at the outlet malls before arriving and we stopped on our way back. It was a perfect 30 min drive from Silver falls, our true destination for our trip.  Such a comfortable and relaxing home to return to have that 7 mi trek! Lol loved it!"

My girlfriend and I especially enjoyed sitting on the back deck/patio for morning coffee and an evening drink - the views of the surrounding hills were very beautiful!  We were very comfortable here - it was cozy and felt just like home!<br/><br/>Mark & Svetlana were absolutely amazing hosts - they were very quick to respond to all our questions and also very accommodating. The entire house is very well stocked - we had everything we needed.  Looking forward to staying here again soon!"

This condo has a Roku TV.  Be sure to bring your personal ID/Passwords for Providers or Networks that you might subscribe to such as Direct TV,  ESPN; Prime TV, Dish, etc.  We didn't have that information with us.

(There we’re five of us total) the kitchen had everything we needed to cook and the couch was super comfortable! We did have a slight issue with the internet connection but we had brought a lot of video games and board games to play so it wasn’t a huge gripe for us. The hosts were very responsive when I had any questions which is always wonderful as well.  Thank you so much for having us!

594312136958704712,734119533895841863,2022-10-09,64153086,Karen,"Your place was impeccably clean and comfortable.  I thought the mattress in the larger back bedroom was much more comfortable than the mattress in the Master.  Since there was plenty of room even though there were only two of us, we spread out which was wonderful.  Thank you."

It was clean and the layout was perfect! <br/>This is a 5 Star Airbnb. <br/>Thanks for making our time in Salem so nice Until next time. .....
594312136958704712,754440626937768951,2022-11-06,92354958,Peggy,Perfect place for a girls weekend…decorated so nicely with such a nice selection of coffee pods and teas. Our hosts were super responsive.  <br/>We highly recommend staying here and visiting the nearby Willamette valley winery too!

594312136958704712,791450480409418478,2022-12-27,58202916,Brenda,"We spent a wonderful Christmas week at Mark and Svetlana’s with our adult children.  Despite some pretty dicey weather, the place was warm and cheerful with a good vibe coming from the electric fireplace and the big windows.  The furnishings are tasteful and the decor welcoming.  We really liked having enough space for us all to feel comfortable.  Two full baths and a powder room were perfect.  As it was the holidays, we did lots of cooking and the kitchen was very well fitted with nearly every gadget imaginable.  They even had an immersion blender which was handy as I made a big pot of soup to keep us warm and cozy.  We frequently visit Salem and would happily stay here again."
594312136958704712,792895425429428236,2022-12-29,116083228,Casey,Really enjoyed the stay.  Place was very comfortable and convenient.  Would definitely recommend and would choose to stay here in the future.  Thank you

There are common walls on either side but we never heard the neighbors it felt very private. We will for sure look for this place again when we go back to Salem.
594312136958704712,839307896991837365,2023-03-03,21265177,Paul,"Our stay at Mark & Svetlana's South Salem townhouse was nothing short of perfect. We stayed there for 6 weeks after our baby was born in Salem Hospital. It was a long time to be away from our own home in the UK, and also such a precious time for our new little family, but we never felt like we were 'away' or missing any comforts. We felt so comfortable and 'at home' - we didn't want to leave! Mark & Svetlana also went above and beyond as hosts - and it all started with the most beautiful welcome gift for our new little bundle of joy. They were so thoughtful, kind and helpful. They were quick to respond to any question or need we had. Their home is beautifully furnished and has all the amenities you need to be more than comfortable. The area is peaceful, calm and clean. The neighbours are also super friendly. There are all the stores and shops you need close by. We cannot recommend Mark & Svetlana's home highly enough!!!"

594378636886993787,689188280483039540,2022-08-08,119547070,John,"Really fun spot right in Salem. The place was nice and clean, parking is abundant and downtown Salem is a quick 5 minute drive down the road. <br/><br/>Ellen was very helpful and quickly responsive when we had questions. We would go back! It worked perfectly for us attending a wedding at a nearby vineyard."

This place is spacious, has everything you need, and is so fun in its decor that you will feel transported. The location is excellent, within walking distance of the capital, downtown shopping, museums, public gardens, restaurants. Full private yard is a real treat, we spent hours sitting outside. There’s always a shady spot. Oh and the host is phenomenal!!"

594378636886993787,849377382885624298,2023-03-17,44439178,Nicholina,"This was a fun little immersion into a whimsical world during a real-world work week.  Parking is off street and free - - the main road a block away didn't really make itself known at night - - and walkable to downtown in 20 mins or less.  I like the natural light in the reading nook, as well."

The place is in a great location, a very easy walk to downtown. We would certainly stay here again if we find ourselves in Salem in the future."
594378674176058095,668147548375324267,2022-07-10,355552609,Doug,"Place was conveniently located within a mile of my event and near the best restaurants in Salem.  The setup of the rooms were perfect and the kitchen had every item that I needed and more.  The place was sparkling, temperature was easily controllable, ceiling fans in the kitchen and bedroom an added plus, and the décor was functional.  Thank you for a great experience and I will be back next year!  Ellen also reached out to ensure that I had no issues (of course, I had none!)."

594378674176058095,677661049100718214,2022-07-23,32788337,Frances,"This was a lovely apartment in Salem and we had a great stay. <br/><br/>I felt like it was expensive for Salem but maybe that's the going rate? There aren't many options for accommodations in Salem and they are all expensive, so I can't imagine any being a better choice than this one."

594378674176058095,787850761524489806,2022-12-22,15932662,Andrea,Such a cute lil cozy place! It had everything I needed and more! I especially loved the artwork and the makeup remover in the bathroom! Nice touch!

She reached out to me to offer extra nights when they were available.  The property was clean, easy to acccess and very organized.  I would definitely return to any of Ellens preoperties in the future. Thank you!."
597102190121690062,657304652253172136,2022-06-25,50448507,Krissy,"Beautiful, updated, large apartment! We could have easily stayed much longer, as there is a spacious living room to enjoy in addition to the basic space needed. The shower and the kitchen were both large and brand new. Everything was clean, check in and out was very easy, and our host was very responsive. The bed was very comfortable. There were extra towels provided, which was nice. The only thing I would emphasize is to make note that it is indeed below another apartment."
597102190121690062,658060573592657117,2022-06-26,346826852,Alana,"This was a perfect place, close to downtown Salem. The host has amazing communication skills. It was nice because I was able to do my laundry before flying back home and there was detergent provided. I would definitely book here again."

The  place was nicely decorated and spotlessly clean and was exactly what we needed for our stay for the Ironman race, as it was super convenient to the race location.  For others, it's near downtown Salem and so would be very convenient for any visit.  The kitchen had the perfect amount of supplies for 2 people and a little dining area with a table for 4, and the AC was great to have during the hot summer.  There's a dishwasher, and washer/dryer, as well, and so it has all the comforts of home.  It was also nice to be able to login to our personal accounts on Netflix and Disney Plus on the TV in the living room.  The home was much more spacious than you can tell from the photos, and the design makes a really good use of the space.  We will definitely be returning in future trips to Salem!"

Everything one would need for a long or short term stay. Clean, neat and tidy, quiet, not overly cluttered with furniture and other items like some airbnbs we’ve stayed in. Construction of this unit is top quality. Bed was so comfortable with European style bedding which is so much nicer than tangling top sheets and blankets etc. <br/>would have loved to stay longer"
597102190121690062,693601358271696509,2022-08-14,1521953,Bini,Clean and fully renovated place. Exactly as described and very comfortable stay. Thank you!

597102190121690062,697941981506311356,2022-08-20,4681289,Karen,"While we were generally satisfied, the home could have been better equipped in order to make our stay more comfortable. The biggest issue for us was the fact that the thermostat was set in such a way that the air conditioning could only be set for a maximum of two hours and then it would kick off. This meant that during the night the air conditioning would turn off automatically and we would wake up because it was too warm. So we ended up waking up several times during the night to set the ac for another two hours."
597102190121690062,698646762154725103,2022-08-21,222217769,Phillip,"Sparkling clean, on a hot day it was nice and chilly AC worked great! Owner was beyond kind and was very patient with us and friendly! Would recommend."

597102190121690062,774781826836473663,2022-12-04,428838116,Amber,"Really enjoyed staying here, it was perfect for what I needed. Michael was super helpful and clear, the place was clean and had everything I needed, and it's an ideal location for anybody with business at the state buildings or downtown. I didn't find many other clean, modern options in this price point so this was a great find. has a great modern thermostat - so many air bnbs I've stayed at have ancient heating systems and it was nice not to spend the trip fighting with temperature inside. Shower has good water pressure and there was little to no noise that transferred from the adjoining apt. Thank you Michael! Would stay here again."
597102190121690062,796521794439715563,2023-01-03,457483899,Mattie,"Great place to stay for a visit; bit of a walk to things if it is raining but not too bad in fair weather.<br/><br/>The space was larger than expected from the photos and definitely felt new and clean.<br/><br/>Main reason I knocked it down to 4/5 is I had wanted to work a few days remotely here and there was not a dedicated workspace, only a kitchen table with dining room chairs which is not the most comfortable for extended hours. Also the wifi was spotty and far slower than 1Gbps as advertised. I think I clocked it in at about 80Mbps which would be fine by me if it were consistent.<br/><br/>Honestly a great place and I would recommend it if you are not planning to work remotely here."

597152408679630910,644290190997811316,2022-06-07,371578570,Cindy,"This place was cute and comfortable.  The view was nice.  The parking was very tight with so many surrounding homes and apartments.  This place really isn't for dogs.  Many stairs that my dogs and I slipped on when it was wet outside, no place to walk them that was safe.  The description was incorrect regarding bringing dogs so I let the owner know, and she changed it."
597152408679630910,647885206589795192,2022-06-12,460258568,Brandon,"A wonderful private and cozy retreate, right in the heart of the the city. We found it very charming and slept woderfuly there."

We found Jolie’s home beautifully decorated and had everything needed for my family. The backyard was my favorite part of it. Loved our stay and would recommend for any family needing a getaway."
597152408679630910,672575283860328381,2022-07-16,164201259,Cheryl,This was a great stay. The house was very clean and more spacious than I expected it to be. And I loved having a place to sit in the shade by the creek on an afternoon when I was tired. The space is the entire upper floor of the house and is completely self-contained with its own entrance. There are other renters downstairs — but we barely saw or heard them.
597152408679630910,687774481012657799,2022-08-06,429469229,Pranith,"Nice and Cozy stay, the host is very responsive. Good stay for 2-3 people, for more people it gets congested. The second room is small, so it will be comfortable for one person. Having a washer, dryer and centralized air conditioner would be great for longer stays."

597152408679630910,745727941952692261,2022-10-25,431593091,Jenna,"Jolie was easy to communicate with and the house was great. Parking was pretty right with two cars but we were able to make it work. Although you have the place to yourself, the outside space is shared and the home is attached to an downstairs renter; it was completely fine for us but something to be aware of if that isn’t comfortable for you. We didn’t use the outside space because it felt a bit awkward with it being shared and such but I’m sure we would have been fine to. Overall it was a great spot and the host was very responsive to messages."

The couch and bed were very comfortable, it’s location was close to lots of things in the area, and our dog loved looking out the window to watch the creek go by in the back. We will definitely try to stay again!"

We had a minor issue and our host was very responsive to our needs. We also unexpectedly had to extend our stay and Jolie was quick to respond and approve our request which greatly reduced our stress. I would stay there again.

This was a great place for our little family of three (incl. a two year old). We brought our own pack and play, and the rest was ready for us when we got there! Jolie provided some recommendations for food nearby that were spot on."

597774178813498790,666772452913462684,2022-07-08,11254097,Kim,We were in town for an event at Willamette University. This spot is close to campus. The space was comfortable and tastefully furnished and it was easy to park. The one thing that might not be to everyone's liking is that it is about a block from train tracks so you will hear trains pass by.
597774178813498790,668885064992904006,2022-07-11,54109328,Cathy,"What a cute place! Plenty of room for two people (possibly even 3 or 4) and only a short drive to downtown Salem. One should know that the train runs right by the place. It wasn’t an issue for us (I enjoy the sound of trains), but for some light sleepers, it might be a problem. Michael was very attentive and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again."
597774178813498790,676835744236135821,2022-07-22,6596385,François,Tastefully furnished and decorated. The pool is cute and welcomed after a hot day touring the local wineries. Everything is new. Great value for what you get.
597774178813498790,678341284818137317,2022-07-24,16490280,Waleed,"This is an excellent stay for two people. Easy parking and check-in along with a clean and updated interior. As other reviewers have pointed out, this Airbnb is right next to the train tracks. You will hear cargo trains pass at least 3 or 4 times per night. If you're a light sleeper, definitely bring ear plugs. Apart from that, it's a quiet and peaceful neighborhood."
597774178813498790,679076478976093733,2022-07-25,221265306,Brennan,Loved the space and the area. Super clean and comfy. Michael is great. Perfect spot to stay for a vacation!

597774178813498790,683442145667980888,2022-07-31,166253372,Paige,Awesome place to stay! A lot of room for two people. Everything’s updated with a nice kitchen. Michael has great communication and is on top of check-in and check-out instructions. The pool was perfect for the hot weekend we were there. Would definitely stay here again!
597774178813498790,713812878119050242,2022-09-11,131375687,Anna,"I am a student who was on rotation in Oregon for six weeks and I couldn't have asked for a better place! Just being a single room place the high ceilings and open design make the place feel much bigger. It has everything you need to fully unwind after a long day and a nice full kitchen to prep for the week. I also thought it was styled really nicely, way better than a hotel room. If you need a place to stay especially for an extended time don't skip over this one! Michael is also there whenever you have a question and always willing to help in anyway he can. Great experience."

597774178813498790,735632260943716981,2022-10-11,34071371,Stephanie,Michael’s space was perfect! It’s updated and modern and has just the right touch to make it feel warm and comfortable. The shower was lovely! The kitchen was lovely 😊 and the cold water in the fridge was a fabulous touch! The way that the windows face (I’m a fan of a fresh breeze) make for a perfect breeze and the rustling of the leaves on the trees was delightful to sleep in. The best part was the train coming through it reminded me of my childhood (it came through in the early evening not midnight just an fyi). Michael was communicative and the keyless entry was superb! I will most definitely be coming back again. Thank you!
597774178813498790,737756318069060807,2022-10-14,45037393,John,Excellent apartment. Spotlessly clean and very comfortable. Close to downtown.

The couch & tv were perfect for lounging. I didn’t use the kitchen as I was only there for a short overnight but it was spacious and inviting! I was making my way from Los Angeles to Seattle, and Michael’s loft was only a few minutes from I-5 which was ideal for me! When I had questions, Michael answered incredibly fast, and was so kind when my tired brain asked dumb questions. I highly recommend this place!!"

We got to walk to the Elsinore Theater from our Air BnB with no issues. Overall, pleasant stay because everything you need to do is there. You can wash your dirty laundry, shower, cook, and sleep!"

My brother wanted to buy the place to live in. <br/><br/>He was also incredibly responsive. We had a small hiccup when we arrived at 5 am and he replied right away.
597774178813498790,845745132874801640,2023-03-12,210200689,Laura,"We came for a weekend long JROTC competition at North Salem High School. We were delighted with the fact that it was a 4 min walk to the school and even in the dark we felt safe walking because the neighborhood was nice, quite, and safe feeling. Airbnbs sometimes have a few items you might need if you have forgotten them, but Michael's place was surprisingly generous with provisions! It was so clean it felt like we were the first people to ever use it! The bed was SO comfortable! The pool looked inviting, and in warmer weather, I'm sure it would be a really nice added amenity! I highly recommend staying here!"

The ease of getting around downtown by foot from here was great. Diana gave clear and timely info on being in the space. My only caveat is that if you are not used to the sounds of living in a downtown building, then there might be more ambient noise than you are used to. That said, we would happily stay there again."

Apartment is in a large building complex so expect to hear apartment noises (not for light sleepers). Overall enjoyed my stay here and would be happy to return.

599149964482178933,758848673032554286,2022-11-12,21013401,Ginger,"Great location for a few night stay. This apartment puts you right in the middle of downtown for shops and restaurants. Being that it’s November it was a little chilly and drafty in the apartment. There were extra blankets which helped a lot. The downside of being central was the street noise of party goers smoking right outside at 3:45am which is not the owners fault but could get annoying with nightly disturbances of yelling, the elevator going up and down and flushing through the exposed pipes.  It was spacious and clean and had soaps and some kitchen items like coffee which was very nice."

599149964482178933,824741914345847072,2023-02-11,18069019,Beth,My husband and I wanted a place to stay in Salem after dinner out at a local restaurant so we could avoid an hour commute home late at night. This place fit the bill. We found free parking 2 blocks away and could walk to/from the restaurant. It was clean and had everything we needed (can’t speak to the kitchen other than using the coffee maker in the morning).  Some other reviews complain about noise. The apartment is next to the elevator and you can hear it from the apartment but it was not constant and it did not bother me. We would stay here again.
599149964482178933,827650856095056840,2023-02-15,350621656,Marcela,This is the cutest apartment! The location couldn’t get any better. It was so quick getting to many places downtown by foot. The apartment is really roomy and cozy. Loved the big windows. I recommend this stay!
599149964482178933,828429310139894707,2023-02-16,323395873,Tim,Great place to stay for exploring downtown Salem. We were here for a concert at the Elsinore Theater. Walkable to all the cool places. Neat industrial feel to the place. Very clean. Expect some plumbing noises as pipes are exposed and early morning light coming in the windows. Minor things. Would stay again for sure
599149964482178933,831296234422965426,2023-02-20,78924747,Amber,"Diana's apartment was just what we needed while in Salem for a sports tournament. Time away from the teenagers with easy access to great food, drinks and coffee. We were able to walk everywhere and even when we had to drive everything was close in proximity. I was worried that the apartment would be loud but it wasn't, we slept great on a very comfortable bed without any outside noise. It was the prefect place for my husband and I. I must also say that Diana is amazing, we desperately needed a later checkout, she was allowed us to stay well beyond checkout time. Not to mention one night our daughter had to stay with us, as we traveled over a day earlier, and we were only booked as a 2 person. So friendly, informative, and flexible which we cannot thank her enough for!"
599149964482178933,834929370792395869,2023-02-25,20739170,Jeff,"Great urban stay.  Apartment is located near great shops and food. Apartment is airy with a unique ""New York loft"" feel. We only stayed one night but would definitely return again. Thank you."

608221513985952006,827620885533042207,2023-02-15,109871205,Harald,"Before all: Annie is a great host - super friendly and responsive. Since she does not live in town, some independent trouble-shooting is at times required (we encountered a few hiccups during our 3-night stay), but communication was always easy and swift. <br/><br/>The rental is immaculately clean, the beds are wonderful, the single AC/heater (once up and running) easily warms the whole apartment, and the kitchen (although in need of some TLC) provides not only all needed utensils but also spices and lots of cleanly packed (non-perishable) food supplies left behind by previous guests - a very welcome surprise. Parking and access (especially with luggage) are not great (during our stay the two stalls in front of the gate were always occupied by the vehicles of guests in the neighboring unit) but not a serious problem.<br/><br/>For longer stays, Annie's place offers a nice combination of comfort and quiet; for short-term visits, however, the high fixed fees drive the total per-night cost up quite a bit."
608221513985952006,851543055571015376,2023-03-20,37108167,Sean,Great host and the location made commuting around Salem very easy. Very responsive and easy to communicate with.
615341342147571495,668152704624745597,2022-07-10,23918018,Kevin,"Our stay at the Capitol Cabin could not have been better. Heather was a wonderful host. She communicated promptly and clearly and made the whole process very easy.<br/>The house was impeccably clean, set up with top quality amenities and kitchen ware, with fun and interesting mid-century decor throughout to complement the architecture. We really appreciated the thought and care that went into creating this beautiful home. Definitely one of the best (of many) Airbnbs we have been to over the years. Thanks again for everything, Heather!"

Get your groove on in this retro house that features the best parts of the 1970's (not the ugly stuff). So cool! Would book again. So many food choices within walking distance. Easy check-in and out. Heather is an actual super host.

Her place is spacious, with a beautiful interior, walking distance to just about any need you have and most of all it has central air. Ahhhhhh!"

You can tell the amount of care and thought put into every piece, from the pretty wallpaper in the bedroom, to the functional kettle. And the plants around the house gave me so much joy, I want them all! Also, for an Airbnb it is very environmentally thoughtful, and the host has made a big attempt to reduce waste as much as possible."
615341342147571495,694287681720700337,2022-08-15,65065730,Thanh,The home is beautiful with luxury beddings and modern furniture. The kitchen is very well stocked. We rested well and prepared many home cooked meals there. Yes I recommend. Yes I would like to come back and stay longer next time.

615341342147571495,700770736755533466,2022-08-24,1304381,Angela,"Really a perfect place to spend our last couple of nights with our daughter before moving her into Willamette! Located in a sweet little neighborhood about 10 min. south of campus, this unique place is one of the coolest airbnbs I’ve stayed in! If you appreciate retro 70s - MCM you need to book this place! From the dishes, to the gorgeous plants everywhere, we loved it all! Heather was super responsive, comfortable beds and bedding. The AC and good coffee beans were an added bonus!"

The neighborhood was quiet and within walking distance of a nearby pub & grocery store. So happy we found this place and would go back again!

Heather is a fantastic host and I wouldn’t hesitate to re-book."

Easy, beautiful, and a good spot to unwind after spending time at the hospital (which was only 10 minutes away). It's also gorgeous, has a well stocked kitchen, and is near a health food store and good Thai food."

Location was great, cleanliness was great, decor was a great throwback with modern conveniences, kitchen was stocked with everything you could think of, beds were comfortable and the house temperature was perfect!  The house is smaller and more than 4 people would be a little cramped, but very much the houses of that era.  If I had any opportunity to go to Salem again, this place would be at the top of my list to stay!  The host was communicative every step of the way but never intrusive!"
615341342147571495,834128452325102382,2023-02-24,33526643,Nicole,"Highly recommend and will definitely be back. Heather's place was immaculate and so comfortable. I have very sensitive dust mite allergies and did not react at all the entire duration of my stay - she keeps it sparkling clean, even below the surface. She was a great communicator and did her best to be flexible with me during a recent winter storm. 10/10!"

616749636817529939,668905686700654161,2022-07-11,189756808,James,I think the room was fairly priced and located in a good spot in Salem for easy access to food and stores.
616749636817529939,673316101224508677,2022-07-17,18776980,Johnny,"A good accomdation for a single person looking for simple, no-frills room. In room microwave and mini-frige adds great convenience. My concern is that the description of this not quite accurate. The place advertises for a private bathroom and room air-conditioning which are both not true. I had to share bathroom with someone else and the room has no air-conditioning. Also, the room cannot lock from inside, which could be a concern as well."
616749636817529939,688476191796278598,2022-08-07,247558635,Darby,Good place to stay when there are limited options and price is cheap. But be aware the host might not ever respond back to your messages.

She was so welcoming and went above and beyond for anything we needed. The room had everything you needed and more, mini fridge stocked with water and yogurt, microwave, coffee maker, king size bed, beautiful bathroom, communal living room, kitchen, and washer dryer. This place had everything and more that we needed. We enjoyed it much more than a hotel.<br/><br/> Definitely recommend staying here if you are looking to visit Downtown Salem and want a nice clean and quiet place to stay. We look forward to coming back!"
627040863803737509,671835030258321189,2022-07-15,167063307,Teigan,Huge thanks to Viviane who was there for every step of the check in process and had the cleanest house! The pictures on the Airbnb post and where I stayed were inaccurate due to remodels going on. The amenities were still fabulous and I loved having a granola bar and oatmeal in the bedroom so I didn’t have to go out for food when I woke up!! So thoughtful.
627040863803737509,673212300689201663,2022-07-17,148393238,Holly,"Viviane’s home was gorgeous. Wonderful hospitality, comfortable and beautiful accommodations, and great location. Couldn’t ask for better!"

There is a massage chair in the room that I got to enjoy after a long day! Viviane is so sweet and is continuing to upgrade the house as well as the backyard! Would have stayed longer if I could. Great place to stay while in Salem.

The house is always clean and she provides you with everything you need. She basically has it set up like a hotel room for her guest. The price is really good for what you get. You have your own microwave, t.v., and fridge. She does allow you to use her kitchen and Fridge. She only ask for you to clean after yourself. Overall great place"

I normally just need a place to crash overnight on business trips and this house met all my needs, with a mini-fridge and microwave in the room. It really calms me to sleep under a ceiling fan so I was thrilled by that little extra. The short time there was so nice I am staying again next weekend when I come back through the area."

Her home is located in a beautifully manicured neighborhood 5 minutes from downtown Salem!  It has a gorgeous recently renovated kitchen, a large main sitting room overlooking the beautiful garden and the backyard. The house had full laundry service and a She is such a kind, hard-working hostess who had snacks, waters, a mini fridge and a microwave in my room. She even had fresh fruits, oatmeal, yogurt and bananas for us. The bathroom was stocked with soft towels and the bed was so comfortable and felt like I was sleeping on a cloud.

I work night shift so I have to sleep during the day. Master bedroom was clean, bathroom was clean, bed was so comfy. I like how there was a mini fridge and microwave in the room. Very convenient. Viviane was very welcoming. Quick response to text messages. I didn't take advantage of the kitchen but maybe next time when I'm back for another assignment. I enjoyed sitting in the back patio when the sun was out, drinking my morning coffee when I'm not working. Easy check-in and check-out. Her home was my home away from home on assignment. Thank you!"

628202912314539345,774078383485405714,2022-12-03,435791366,Colin,"Everything was great! Definitely a little further away from interstate five and I anticipated. However, the neighborhood is peaceful. It’s a house that has a total of three rooms that are rented out through Airbnb. The shared bathroom is all the way on the other side of the house. So you have to go through the living room or kitchen to get to it. That wasn’t a big deal. The Only thing I struggled with was the strong laundry perfume scent of the sheets. The smell of them was so strong that it actually woke me up a few times Throughout the night."

632033859737692079,676154582412545680,2022-07-21,70280536,Patricia,"The Koi Condo is stylish & charming with personal touches and unexpected amenities like snacks, hot chocolate, cotton balls, & makeup removal pads. The backyard is an enchanting & idyllic oasis, including a visiting tuxedo kitty and bistro lights at night. The photos & posting are accurate except for a couple delightful additions like a fire pit with cute Adirondack chairs and a microwave. Communication from the host was clear and thorough. Keep in mind, it is a BASEMENT unit next to a creek with all that entails: low ceiling, uneven flooring, a surprisingly loud sump pump in the bathroom, a toilet requiring single ply toilet paper, exposed plumbing in the laundry room, and the occasional insect. The bedroom is very cozy, as pictured, with comfy linens and no windows. The occasional footsteps from upstairs could be heard. The sofa converts into a small twin sized bed. Even with these small inconveniences, we enjoyed our stay. P.S. Sybil's down the block is great for breakfast, especially during their 40th Anniversary celebration with 1980's pricing."
632033859737692079,684813049353712725,2022-08-02,460916465,Christopher,"it is a lovely downstairs apartment with all the amenities one could ask for. we really enjoyed our stay. the owner is very considerate, friendly and easy going. we had absolutely no problems and would definitely stay again."
632033859737692079,708711950262167061,2022-09-04,121743250,Rachel,"My husband and I stayed in this adorable airbnb for over a month, and it was such a wonderful place. The small touches (like snacks and toiletries) and the super responsive host really made the stay amazing. The view from the window is truly incredible. <br/><br/>It's worth noting that the noise-level from upstairs dramatically depends on the guests staying there. We were there awhile, so several guests came and went. Sometimes we barely heard them, other times it was super noticeable. Obviously, the host has no control over this - it's just something worth knowing. <br/><br/>The kitchen sink is also super teeny, but we were able to make it work even though we cooked 95% of our meals at the airbnb (just be super patient ;)). <br/><br/>Also, word to the wise, be suuuuper careful stepping out of the shower. It's much higher off the ground than it seems. <br/><br/>Definitely recommend this airbnb and host if you're in and around Salem."
632033859737692079,714573590936130028,2022-09-12,140865350,Andrea,"Our stay was honestly perfect! A friend and i were in town for a wedding and we loved the feeling of coming back to a cozy spot! Also loved all the amenities they had, this place was so well equipped! Overall, a great stay!"
632033859737692079,726170162517715805,2022-09-28,71894933,Kai,"This is a relaxing, cute little space. It was perfect for me during my work trip. Spend some time in the hammock watching the squirrels above you in the trees - you’ll be glad you did!"
632033859737692079,728331574300830570,2022-10-01,190269745,Rachel,Nice place.  Good value
632033859737692079,729092849306685541,2022-10-02,66233100,Laurie & George,"The place is cutely decorated, but it was very closterphobic. There is no window in the bedroom, and many locked entrences that made me feel unsafe. We also encountered many spiders."
632033859737692079,731995725863652325,2022-10-06,182553020,Cyusa,Jolie was very nice and her hospitality is amazing!
632033859737692079,732682505318887148,2022-10-07,419852803,Amanda,"Great cozy spot with a fun vibe and unique river view! Kitchen is dialed in and has everything you could think of, situated in a fun corner with plenty of great places to grub nearby within walking distance in case you didn't plan on cooking."
632033859737692079,734159911694723202,2022-10-09,538217,Erin,"Amazing location and back yard.  Just a few minutes from Willamette University.  Funky basement apartment with ample room.  Nice amenities.  Upstairs neighbors were pretty loud, but turning on the box fan helped a lot with noise level.  Sump pump is super loud, don’t be startled when you flush (or shower)!   Looking forward to staying again."
632033859737692079,784880605941882753,2022-12-18,173750759,Marcella,Jolie's place was cute and relaxing. The backyard was so lovely and a beautiful space to hang out. Jolie was also extremely responsive to any and all questions I had during my stay!
632033859737692079,789953082866064605,2022-12-25,490491985,Amy,"We loved everything the place. It felt right at home, very cozy like described. We would be coming here again for sure."

638534831759766829,734085488763698228,2022-10-09,887506,Michael,"Perfect self-contained stay for work. Unit had everything I needed, laundry room was shared and coin operated but machines worked great. The standout was the host. Victoria was extremely accommodating and responded right away to any messages. She also went a step beyond and mailed some affairs back to me that I had absent-mindedly left behind. If I'm ever down in Salem for an extended stay again, she'll be my first call."
641487920022488174,656559882188726884,2022-06-24,616523,Ankit,"Great communication, great host! lovely  room that has everything you need."
642268829856491847,734082179690670178,2022-10-09,33043818,Nissa,"This is a lovely accommodation! Jillian’s description of the home and the amenities is quite accurate.<br/><br/>Exceptionally clean home. <br/><br/>Kitchen was well stocked (we did cook dinner and had everything we needed) and there were thoughtful touches such as spices, sweeteners, coffee and tea; appliances are all new and the double oven is great (used it!). Living room area is comfy and has a large TV; dining area will seat six comfortably. Bedrooms and bathrooms were lovely; plenty of towels and again nice touches such as quality soap, room spray, Q-tips and cotton rounds. Do note that the primary suite bathroom is open to the rest of the room (as noted in the listing) so there is no door to close that off from the rest of the room.  <br/><br/>The home is on a fairly well-traveled street (also noted in the listing) but it didn’t bother us at all and it’s great to be just minutes from a great grocery store, Dutch Bros, plenty of other food options etc. We utilized street parking right in front of the home but there is back parking too if preferred. A/C worked well, all lighting was good, and I really appreciated bedside tables with built in USB ports and extra AC plugs. <br/><br/>All in all: Jillian has done a lovely job as a host and we would stay here again any time and would recommend to others as well! Thank you!"
642268829856491847,736321292698010311,2022-10-12,240130955,Sarah,"Jillian’s house is well appointed. She pays attention to all the small details. USB ports in the nitestands, lots of blankets and pillows, towels and washcloths. <br/>I was somewhat apprehensive about the street parking but it was not an issue I felt my car was perfectly safe. The owner does live in the property but wasn’t intrusive at all. You can see her play with her pup in the yard which as endearing since I always miss my own dog when I travel. Would definitely recommend and stay here again!"
642268829856491847,739152691448343197,2022-10-16,218097132,Angela,"Jillian was a great host. She communicated well, and met all expectations. I even forgot a couple important items, and she messaged me right away to let me know. <br/>The house is beautiful. She has done a lovely job of decorating. Everything was well thought out and extremely organized! She has labels to help you find your way around the home. There were several convenient items which made our stay very smooth!"

That shows a lot of effort a detail. <br/>It was like I’ve been there before.<br/><br/>Jillian was a great host with great choice in family games!"

Her house is super clean and the layout is awesome. Very spacious bedrooms with comfortable beds and cozy bedding. The kitchen had everything we need to cook meals and even had a lovely little coffee bar. This is a gem of a listing in West Salem, you won’t be disappointed!"
642268829856491847,766729787304924344,2022-11-23,166462794,Marlaine,It was a perfect place for my family to stay at during their Thanksgiving visit.   I would totally use this place again!
642268829856491847,771186554768274147,2022-11-29,33312357,Robert,"Our 5 night stay at Jillian's home was perfect.   She has setup a very nice home with everything in cabinets clearly labeled, light switches labeled.   The home is remodeled nicely, very well done.   Comfortable, and good value for our stay.    We had no complaints at all.    We'll very likely stay here again when we visit family in West Salem again next year."
642268829856491847,779110661383193994,2022-12-10,41777516,Amy,"Jillian is an excellent host. Her place has everything you need for a comfortable stay in Salem. It is quite lovely inside, and her taste is superb. She goes beyond in providing every kitchen and housekeeping item that you could ever need. (The only things missing are washer/dryer, and this is disclosed in the listing.) I had to work while I was in town, and she has two excellent dedicated work spaces available. I highly recommend her place."
642268829856491847,793659287530485998,2022-12-30,63511723,Tina,We had a wonderful Christmas celebration here for our family who traveled from three different states. Jillian was proactive with weather warnings and offered a free night if we were able to travel early and avoid the freezing rain. Her beautiful place represents her caring demeanor with high quality snacks and coffee/ tea options. She even set up a real Christmas tree to complete our celebration. <br/><br/>The place in West Salem was ideal for us to visit our local family members and easy to find. Great location with hilly streets to get a good walk or run. Kitchen is well stocked with everything I needed to make meals. Bedrooms are roomy with bedding options for all sleep preferences.
642268829856491847,800856640020339174,2023-01-09,11138052,Gabby,Our stay was perfectly fine. The coffee bar was great.

Home was clean, easy to find with plenty of parking. Location was perfect for our needs in West Salem. Our family settled in and enjoyed playing games (that are provided) and spending time together. Definitely would recommend this place and Jillian as a host!"

My issue with many airbnbs is that the living room furniture isn’t comfortable. Also, her attention to giving you a healthful stay is reflected in her choice of soaps, organic treats, spices, coffees… We look forward to coming back."
642268829856491847,818909652502852113,2023-02-03,30502342,Chris,"If I could give a hundred stars, I would. We have stayed at many airbnbs, and this one is exemplary!  So much care has been taken to ensure comfort."

I was visiting for a business trip, and having coffee and a bowl of oatmeal in the morning was a real treat. The neighborhood is busy, but once inside, the place is peaceful, and private. The jetted tub was a real delight! She also has some really nice artistic decor. Over all, great value, responsive host, and very pleased. Thanks Jillian!"
642268829856491847,843562148102478194,2023-03-09,27864478,Kenadie,"We had an amazing stay at Jillian’s place! Exactly as described. It was well cleaned upon arrival. Jillian was very communicative throughout the entire time from booking-checking out. It was a nice central stay for us while exploring around Oregon. <br/>There is plenty of storage if you have an extended stay. Kitchen had all utensils, cookware you could think to use. As well as a few different coffee options, tea, and common spices. <br/>We all felt this was a great deal and we would definitely stay again, and recommend to others! <br/><br/>Of note: the mattresses are all pretty firm/hard. We didn’t mind, but just to be aware."

All the kitchen drawers and cabinets are labeled - no hunting for supplies. Comfy stay and would highly recommend.

643423043957099940,645718389157325521,2022-06-09,462643557,Elizabeth,Yvonne's rental was a one night stop on a long road trip and it's exactly what I needed. It was so quiet in the neighborhood and the frog sounds at night were such a welcome change from the noisy city I live in. The bed was comfy and the room was so dark at night I could sleep soundly. The home is large and well decorated and I had access to all the amenities to recharge. Parking is easy and I felt safe as a solo traveller in the neighborhood. This is a great value and I hope to make Yvonne's place a stop whenever I am in Salem.
643423043957099940,661711085467969819,2022-07-01,59823032,Janelle,"Yvonne and her family were so warm and welcoming.  The house was secure,safe and beautifully decorated.  I felt really at home in my little room.  Since I was working nights the curtains were dark enough and the other residents were quiet enough to make for good daytime sleep.  Would 10/10 stay again!"

643441015195418684,668202712973305493,2022-07-10,50483247,Miriam,Yvonne rents several rooms out in a nice house that is fully equipped. The other tenants were very respectful and one gal was down for the same triathlon race that I was so it was nice meeting her. There is a backyard with some chairs where you can read which is quite nice.

647232541551978262,738484321304710854,2022-10-15,190133683,Anne,"This spacious apartment in downtown Salem is a perfect place to stay long-term.  I stayed in the two bedroom apartment on the second floor, both which have large windows that provide lots of natural light. The furnishings are new, attractive and comfortable.  Some great features of the apartment are a full-size washer/dryer, a very well appointed kitchen, and two attached private decks for outside seating.  Of course, one of the best things about this apartment is the location.  It is right in the middle of downtown Salem, close to restaurants and coffee places, shopping, the convention center and one block away from miles of walking trails along the Willamette River and Minto Island Park.  Within a half a block is an excellent coffee shop called Isaac's that features great coffee drinks and the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had!  I highly recommend this apartment."
647232541551978262,759500887850760569,2022-11-13,41414835,Steve,"The condo is very nice inside, clean, and well equipped. the location of very convenient to downtown Salem, but it is on a narrow and there is no view except for the alley.<br/><br/>Angela was very accommodating and made sure everything went smoothly. I would definitely stay here again."
647232620270342292,668899489014884233,2022-07-11,262062889,Tammy,Wonderful location!  The space was clean and quiet.  I would stay here again if I am ever in Salem.

647232620270342292,719647560180104844,2022-09-19,115684007,Jim,Nice location in Salem off of Commercial.  Quiet downstairs area going through the garage.
647232620270342292,744241959909371639,2022-10-23,107925563,Colleen,"The location was great, the unit was clean, and the sauna was a bonus. However, it's awkward when so many of the promised appointments (the heater, the WiFi, and the television) don't work and you have to address them with the property manager, as well as AirBnB. <br/><br/>Initially, the property manager came over around 6pm on Friday and we tried to get things working. We were unsuccessful in fixing the problems. No service workers were available to fix the heater, and I was promised a space heater the next day, and they would also attempt to fix the internet. <br/><br/>The property manager delivered the space heater the next day. I was away from the unit and simply asked them to leave the heater in a safe place outside my door and that I'd bring it inside when I got back to the unit at 6pm that evening.<br/><br/>They sent me a note via AirBnB messaging stating they were troubled that I wouldn't give them access to my unit, and that they thought it was strange. I messaged them that I didn't know, nor did they tell me, that they needed access. I called them trying to get clarification and they became angry telling me that they'd bent over backwards for me, and that it's been extremely inconvenient for them trying to fix these things, and I should have let them in the unit when I wasn't there.<br/><br/>They made me feel that these problems were mine and that I should just deal with it. I checked out at 9am on Sunday morning. The bad energy from this experience really tainted my entire weekend. A more understanding attitude by the property manager would have done so much to make this better."
647232620270342292,750064603737845087,2022-10-31,371457952,Jennifer,"It's a lovely place to stay. Everything you could want, including sauna (!), and the cheerful yellow door welcomes you in!"
647232620270342292,763148995314165997,2022-11-18,472395249,Rebecca,"We came out for a family emergency and the hotels in the area were sold out or costly during the weekend we were arriving so we decided on Cindy’s nook.  This feels like a little cottage away, but close to restaurants and stores.  Prefect for the two of us and what we needed.  Angela was a great host, very responsive.  The kitchenette worked perfectly for us, as we weren’t cooking meals.   It was so comfortable and cozy, much better then a hotel so we canceled our hotel room and extended our stay."
647232620270342292,774039820752605351,2022-12-03,193570778,Joseph,"Don’t pass this up. <br/>Super cute, well decorated and a great location in a nice neighborhood. <br/>Prior to checking in Angela sent a video showing how to use the keyless entry which was brilliant and super helpful."
647232620270342292,790650471068500391,2022-12-26,193570778,Joseph,This is my 2nd time staying here. <br/>I’ll book again anytime I’m in the area.
647232620270342292,824709052678211157,2023-02-11,36794905,Ashley,"This space is super cozy and immediately feels like your own little space. It is basically a finished basement, with a private entryway through the garage. It has a small window so there is opportunity for sunlight if you want it. My stays felt really private and quiet. There’s a little fireplace that keeps the place warm and the floor is carpeted which feels really nice. If there were people staying upstairs during my stay, I never heard a sound. It’s right off a main St. where a lot of grocery shops and restaurants are and probably about 5/6 mins from the hospital. Unsure of airport but I would recommend a car.<br/>This place is most appropriate for singles, couples and for families with small infants who cannot crawl around and make messes and get into things yet (unsure if kids allowed though) <br/>The host is very clear with instructions, I was sent a step by step video and they personalize the key pad code just for you so it will be difficult to forget. <br/>I Would 100% recommend to others"
647232620270342292,831952809168517245,2023-02-21,105134302,Roberta,perfect for my visit

647232620270342292,842145890555377284,2023-03-07,81509838,Rebekah,"This was a wonderful space. Just as an FYI, the ceiling was a bit short in parts for my 6'8"" spouse, but he was able to stand up fully in most of the space. Our one disappointment was that the sauna did not appear to be working at the time of our visit, but otherwise, the space was clean, comfortable, centrally located, and in a quiet neighborhood."

651626098802980554,750750521005685952,2022-11-01,454417968,Jonathan,Alisa was an amazing host. Check in was smooth and my stay was very comfortable. Grapes are grown on the property and the hosts did not hesitate to share constantly. I would love to stay here again. The location is perfect.
651626098802980554,758827667502165296,2022-11-12,484765147,John,"I call this place the House of Lost Men. It's three small rooms in a row, the owner doesn't live there, though there are two cats. Fortunately the other two guys were quiet: one loud person could make this place not-so-great. The owner Elisa communicated well, and fast, and checked in on the place a couple/few times a day. Good location in West Salem: near Safeway, and restaurants, and a nice cafe to hang out in, and pretty quick drive into downtown Salem, and/or heading north or south on 99. The room is small: the bed takes up most of the space. The bed was lumpy and sagged at the one corner, so I felt like I was sleeping with my head below my feet sometimes. it's also squeaky: I felt bad for the other two guys staying there every time I had to get in or out of bed. The room on the end also had a super loud squeaky door. I had my own bathroom across the hall, which was nice. No outside lock on the door: I could lock it when I was in, but when I left it remained unlocked. The kitchen had everything, and I hardly saw the other two guys. This felt more like a european hostel room rather than, say, a bedroom.  I don't know, I'm kind of new at this. The room was smaller than I expected. Elisa and her son were nice. Airbnd seems to think and 'ok' rating is a bad thing, but...it was ok."
651626098802980554,809577273722028818,2023-01-21,134152879,Ying,The place is so clean and well equipped! It is private and comfortable. The host is very nice and stayed up for me to show me around even when I arrived at 2am in the middle of the night!
651626098802980554,837061956828215403,2023-02-28,61282095,Alex,"Alisa and her family were great. The place was lovely and super convenient with a grocery, Cafe, and restaurants/bars, gas station, auto mechanic, massage place, book store, and all kinds of stuff within walking distance. Super convenient for bus routes, and close to downtown, right off the highway."

It was really clean, had even a pitch filter! Super easy to access did not had any issue at all. I loved this place a lot, it’s super near to the park where the river is and you can walk everywhere. People is so friendly! Diana was very polite even when my bf forgot some shoes I got him for his birthday. She let me go and take them after we check out. I recommend you to get pizza from the place down the apartment, it’s so delicious! Love this place and will definitely book it again when I come back to salem. Thank you Diana!"
652918240358369342,676187256818232542,2022-07-21,136106820,George,"We were in Salem for four nights. The studio apartment was perfect for what we needed. The location is fantastic. In the heart of old downtown, within walking distance of a dozen great restaurants. An easy drive to the coast or hundreds of wineries. We will definitely stay here again."

Check-in was very easy, the studio is in a great location, yet in a very quiet building. You're walking distance to fabulous restaurants and shops, and there is free 3-hour street parking, making it easy to explore the area by car if you wish. I would definitely stay here again!"

652918240358369342,714604648531439230,2022-09-12,478330215,Benjamin,This location was so fun and the apartment was really clean and well decorated! The host was very communicative and helpful!

652918240358369342,808786879187712030,2023-01-20,17984324,Jennifer,"Right downtown, easy walking to everything. Place was clean and simple. No immediate outside windows, so if you are claustrophobic, might not be right for you. I didn't have an issue with that. I would stay here again. The parking is a little odd, there is a garage nearby that you can park overnight."
652918240358369342,810938810062233307,2023-01-23,127072959,Amber,"Such a cute little spot! Was perfect for us as a couple. Check in was super easy, and we got parking right out front. Kitchen and bathroom were very clean and stocked with everything that was needed. Living room/sleeping area was super cozy and love the plants and designs. Location was exactly what we needed. 5 minute walk to Elisnore Theater, lots of walkable restaurants, and they also had a bar downstairs open late that served food. The host was responsive, friendly, and gave clear instructions. Would absolutely recommend if you need a quaint room in this location."
652918240358369342,816039856823362028,2023-01-30,266444203,Sara,"The place was great, just a few suggestions. The heating remote must be within 10 feet of the wall unit. It took us a while to figure this out because the remote holder is near the door and we kept attempting to make it work from there or from the bed-both which are too far away from the unit.<br/>Also a reading light or lamp next to the bed would be fabulous. Reading in bed with the over head lights wasn’t the greatest.<br/>Otherwise the place is great. Love the location and the treats!"
652918240358369342,816796356404494494,2023-01-31,21109675,Jennifer,I will stay here again! My stay was quiet and perfect for my needs.

Our girls felt very comfortable in Jolie's home and liked the decor and little details about the house.  The weather was so wet, dark and rainy that we had no idea there was a river at the back of the property.  She filled the house with everything one would need for a comfortable stay- cozy blankets to watch a movie, candles, nice linens and towels, etc. We'll definitely book again next year!"

The street is very narrow and a little tricky to find initially, but it's a quiet location right by the creek. Jolie was very responsive to our needs! The king and queen beds were very comfortable, but the bunkbeds might be best for kids - our young adult daughters didn't sleep great on the bunk mattresses."

The community is very nice to walk around, and quiet if you're walking with a stroller.  There are also a couple of restaurants within a reasonable walk. if the Oregon weather cooperates. <br/><br/>One thing to note - there is a parking pad for one car, but it isn't very long, so a larger car you will need to park on the street.  We didn't have any problems with the street parking, but just something to keep in mind."

695144434640162822,849407882794229103,2023-03-17,503270038,April,"It was nice. Instructions were clear, and the host’s responses were very fast. Also it was very nice that they had a washer and dryer on site, plus a kitchen, and there was shopping and a bus stop close by. The room itself was small, which is just fine at the price. My one complaint is that there were ants in the specific room I stayed in. The room looked clean, though, and they had us take our shoes off at the entrance. Overall, it was a good stay for the price."

We (family of 3 sons and a dog) were visiting family in south Salem for Thanksgiving. So festive to find a Christmas tree in the living room. We enjoyed little details like dimmer switches for all the lights and a gas range. Rishel's home is in a quiet neighborhood - felt like we had our own cul-de-sac. The backyard is fully fenced which was great for our dog. Would love to stay again.

Thank you Rishel for being a great host!"

They went above and beyond to welcome us with complementary snack basket, cold drinks in the refrigerator, and anything you may have forgotten at home. there’s a hot tub on the deck, which looks very inviting we didn’t use it, but it was tempting. And a really nice sitting area in the backyard very private. Would definitely recommend staying there."

The amenities and the complimentary treats were well thought out and very much appreciated. The place was very spacious with a nice walk in closet.  The bed was super comfortable with good quality pillows and bedding.  We wish we would have had more time to enjoy the outdoor space of the hot tub and fire pit. But we did have breakfast on the peaceful deck surrounded by beautiful trees. Her place was also very close to Blacksheep Cafe & Catering which we discovered had amazing food!  Thank you Emily for your thoughtfulness and making our stay enjoyable.  We look forward to staying here again.  😍😍

The room it self felt like sleeping in a cabin out in the woods, the only thing missing was the indoor fireplace, but hey; why have an indoor fireplace when they provide a outdoor fireplace place! <br/>The hot tub was amazing, having that privacy balcony along  with the tub, couldn’t get any better.  Place was quiet, and I had good sleep through out the night. <br/>Emily was amazing in communicating, and make sure we had everything we needed. <br/>I will definitely book this place again to stay. <br/>I highly recommend this place for anyone who is coming into town and looking for a place. <br/>Thank you again."

She was such a sweetheart, too, leaving a note and treats for my pup!

The garage is very nice to have as it was raining when we arrived and were able to load and unload our things out of the rain.  The king size bed was comfortable and has nice sheets, blankets and pillows.  The kitchen was well stocked and had everything you would need for your stay.  We had booked it for three nights but had to leave the first morning as we had a family emergency.  We will book this again when we return to Salem to see family and friends.  Love this place."

The beds and bed linens were very comfortable as well. It was also so nice to be able to pull into the clean and tidy garage to unload and load the car. I would definitely stay with Judy in the brick house again."

There were a few very minor things that could be improved and I let Stacy and Justin know and they were committed to fixing them. The neighborhood is close to downtown Salem, very close to Willamatte U and walking distance to some bars. We took dogs and a toddler and infant and it worked out great! The bathtub is nice and low so easy for my older family member with knee pain to get in and out of. My kids loved the tub. Washer and dryer worked fabulous. The hosts were excellent at communicating! I couldn’t recommend more. I was safe and comfortable as we went in the winter and the heater works well! We will be back!"

Elle stayed in contact with us when needed and was so helpful and kind. We were in town while looking for an apartment, pre move, and we couldn't have possibly felt more welcome and at home.

731437149026597310,850113658652712842,2023-03-18,142225483,Blake,"Cam & Elle were great hosts. Very responsive in communication. The house is in a nice neighborhood that felt safe and was very quiet. Big couches in the living room were a great place to relax at the end of the day. The upstairs is accessed with a steep staircase with a low overhead so pay attention to the instructions. The beds were comfortable, and while we are not used to sleeping in a full size bed the mattress was very comfortable and we enjoyed a good nights sleep. The house is an older home, and if you're looking for something fancy then this might not be the place for you. But if your looking for a clean, well equipped house where you can feel at home then I would recommend you consider this rental. If you have any questions I encourage you to reach out to Cam and Elle, they are more than willing to help make your stay the best possible. They even gave us a recommendation of a local park where we could enjoy some time with our grandchildren."

734928705811848578,844362372156031760,2023-03-10,254443127,James,"Mark and Svetlana's place was just what I needed. I was traveling for work, and I felt right at home here. It was unusual, but I had tons of questions for them. Not only did they answer immediately, but they made an effort to help me as much as they possibly could. Great place to stay, even better hosts. I would absolutely recommend them."

739339593342158838,747936344540760973,2022-10-28,484261787,Megan,"We had an absolute blast. The attention to detail, the great communication, and all amenities were 5 star! The plants were so beautiful, and made the space very inviting and cheerful! We felt like we had everything we would ever need for our weeks stay. The fact that we could walk downstairs for a meal made it that much better! We will recommend it to family and friends!"
739339593342158838,750089087588943345,2022-10-31,5248575,Marie,Obsessed with the vibe of this Airbnb. Beautiful decorative touches! The shower is definitely the most beautiful I’ve ever seen! Hope to stay again next time I’m in Salem
739339593342158838,753006438192878530,2022-11-04,296839718,Kymber,We had a wonderful stay at this historical retreat. If you're into history and architecture and things of the like you'll definitely enjoy this huge home. The beds were very comfortable and Lillian was very communicative and accommodating. The place exceeded our expectations and was close to everything Salem has to offer. We highly recommend this abode!!
739339593342158838,754485432112479863,2022-11-06,40234737,Sherry,"A great location, very cool place. Loved the exposed brick and eclectic decor! It was only 2 of us, but the large family room/dining area was great and Lillian has stocked the place with games! We had a few family members come over while we were staying there to have dinner and play games. It was such a great setup! Will definitely go back!"
739339593342158838,759506437928324458,2022-11-13,256095991,Krystle,"This place is so cool! amazing style, clean, the coolest shower ever. <br/>plenty of space!!"

739339593342158838,767490880210652282,2022-11-24,32291687,Patrick,Lillian is a great host.  Open communication lines and quick responses to all messages.  A delight
739339593342158838,769727240339206362,2022-11-27,4366469,Ashlee,"My husband and I would live in this place! The decor and set up was stunning! Definitely a larger space than we needed, but it's so beautiful! The shower with plants and the old fashioned pull flush toilet were probably my favorite features. There is some noise/music that travels from the restaurant as Lillian mentions, but it died down before we were going to bed, so we slept soundly. We were also able to easily order food from downstairs when we didn't feel like cooking. Our dogs appreciated having a new dog bed and toys to play with, as well as room to wrestle! This will be our new go to for visiting Salem!"
739339593342158838,778328745987160029,2022-12-09,97713683,Leann,"This was a fantastic stay! The location just minutes from downtown was amazing, and of course being right above McMenamins couldn't be better. The space was cozy and there were a lot of small touches. The beds were super comfortable and the shower was fabulous. If you are a light sleeper, I did hear some noise from downstairs at night, but it was fine for me! I parked on the street, which was fine overnight- if you'll be around during the day you might need to move your car after a while. Overall, there was a ton of room, a beautifully designed space, and great amenities. I hope to be back in this space again- highly recommend!"
739339593342158838,780593465030461419,2022-12-12,44346844,Jamie,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Lillian’s. It was everything we expected and more. All of the touches that have been added make the whole place feel homey and modern at the same time. We loved the stained glass and the history of the building. <br/>You can hear a bit of restaurant noice but it did not bother us. It was muted and actually made us feel cozy. We did eat downstairs one night and the staff and food was awesome.  The space is large and has everything anyone may need during their stay. We will definitely stay again when in Salem.
739339593342158838,785575568912335187,2022-12-19,20196453,Shiloh,"Lillian's place was so amazing. It was beyond our expectations. Right up our alley, funky and unique.  We are also Mcmenamins junkies so the location above Mcmenamins was the frosting.  (although unfortunately on this trip we didn't even get to go down there due to our time constraints). Lillian was very responsive as well. We spend a lot of time in Salem and so definitely will be back.  Love love love the vibe.  Thanks Lillian!!"
739339593342158838,790682987260818730,2022-12-26,89743720,Cary,"So much space!  Even bigger than it appears in photos.  Historic, eclectic feel - very charming and cozy.  Super convenient location - close to downtown and Riverfront Park. The shower is fantastic!  Really appreciated the dog bed, dishes and toys - so thoughtful.  Highly recommend."
739339593342158838,792927801203268333,2022-12-29,30015961,Susan,"The place is nice and well decorated. Beds were comfy! We did not get the code for check in and took nearly an hour to get a response from the host so we could get in. The noise from the bar downstairs was considerable, more than previous reviewers noted."
739339593342158838,795717745463898590,2023-01-02,47902241,Genoa,"We loved our stay at the Downtown Loft! It was in a great location with plenty of parking. The entire space was clean and comfortable, and we had everything we needed. It was perfect. The amount of space and beautiful decor made us feel right at home. Next time we travel to the area, we would absolutely stay in the Loft again."
739339593342158838,799341744631832140,2023-01-07,302585709,Peter,"Such a charming, spirited unit! Absolutely fun! Thank you for the cute decorations - that fridge is amazing."
739339593342158838,815352062608419059,2023-01-29,104852763,Elizabeth,"The parking is tight and it is pretty loud at night being right downtown. The space and history of the place was unique. It was difficult to plan meals with not having a kitchen. The shower was nice but having a limited number of towels and kitchen items.. we were having to do laundry and clean dishes early the next morning. Also, advertising a record player but not having any records was a bummer. We went and purchased some across the street only to find player is broken."
739339593342158838,829897334855390480,2023-02-18,490400429,Karen,Wonderful space. We had 5 adults and we had plenty of space.  It was a terrific place for us to hang out and visit.

739339593342158838,845792089754406288,2023-03-12,13170297,Jennifer,This space is SO BIG! I wish I had invited more friends to join us! The PacMan machine plays more than just PacMan! We had Galaga tournaments and had so much fun!<br/>The shower was beautiful with live plants decorating the inside! We loved it!
741268950953419301,790698345803776232,2022-12-26,10435690,Jen,"Chris is a very accommodating host. The kitchen and house are well stocked and the space worked for our large family of 6. Thanks again, Chris!"

741268950953419301,800123985038181000,2023-01-08,29009797,Seth,Christopher’s place was just what we needed. It was roomy and comfortable. We were able to spread out and relax before we had to head out to our obligations in Salem.<br/><br/>Christopher was very communicative and proactive with checkin. <br/><br/>I’d recommend the place if you are in the Salem area!!
741268950953419301,803698308404077683,2023-01-13,248518774,Dena,Awesome place
741268950953419301,805938414907316116,2023-01-16,90618649,Laura,"Very clean and comfortable space. You will never be bored here! Decor is funky and eclectic. There are tons of games and books. Christopher has thought of everything. There is plenty of cookware and spices, lots of extra towels and toiletries. We had a lovely rainy weekend here!"
741268950953419301,808820992879315490,2023-01-20,248518774,Dena,"This was our second stay here during our displacement from our own home in town. I enjoy being in a space that’s large enough my fiancé can work from “home” while my toddler and I kept busy in other parts of the house. The kitchen was well stocked with pots, pans, plate ware and also a drying rack to hand wash dishes or a dish washer if that’s your preference. There are so many restaurants less than 5 minutes away: Ventis, Five Guys, Subway, Straight from New York pizza, Jamba Juice. Super convenient. The shower gets amazingly hot water. Super appreciated having a washer and dryer on hand for our extended stay."

741268950953419301,817465316913578920,2023-02-01,248518774,Dena,"Chris is a very accommodating host. We’ve been staying here while displaced from our own home, so it’s literally been home away from home. Any questions we have had throughout our stay have been answered very quickly. We’ve easily cooked meals here with his kitchen having most utensils/pots/ pans and what not that we need. Very close to downtown where I work has made it an extremely convenient stay. <br/><br/>Every tv we have used has had Netflix logged in which we’ve enjoyed. My fiancé works from home and has been able to easily set up his computer and use the wifi without any connection errors. The downstairs arcade area is a nice disconnect from the upstairs allowing for quiet working and loud playing. The laundry room is also down there and has a nice folding table to organize it all. <br/><br/>It has felt like home. Thank you."
741268950953419301,818953594853760664,2023-02-03,248518774,Dena,"Such a convenient stay, so close to many restaurants, grocery/ convenient stores. Home has so much space for a family to spread out. Many board games to entertain yourselves with; including Mouse Trap! There’s also a jetted tub and massage chair I’ve found myself in more often then I imagined."
741268950953419301,820461848163871536,2023-02-05,3000789,Heidi,Christopher was very proactive and responsive. We felt at home and enjoyed walking our dogs at Clark Creek park. The house had a wide assortment of games and entertainment options. The Pac-Man in the basement rec room was especially fun. The home was clean and provided adequate space for our family.
741268950953419301,824749053016634376,2023-02-11,248518774,Dena,"We stayed here for just a little over a month off and on while having repairs done at our own house. It was such a nice comfortable stay (fully functioning kitchen, washer dryer downstairs, two showers, plenty of space) Chris was a super cool host and comes across as a really respectful person. Won’t hesitate to stay again if needed."

741268950953419301,830578507095098735,2023-02-19,129034964,Felicia,Christopher was one of the best hosts we’ve experienced with air bnb. We traveled for our boy’s basketball tournament and he was flexible with check in and check out. The house was fully stocked with everything we needed and more. The house itself was spacious enough for 3 families. Very eclectic and lots of cool history in the house. The boys said it was like a museum. Cool stuff in every room and lots of games. Water was always hot with the many showers that were taken and plenty of towels. Close to restaurants and easy access to the freeway. Chris was very responsive and we appreciated that very much! We would definitely stay here again! The complimentary wine and beer was a nice surprise after a long day of travel and games. Thank you so much Christopher! We would definitely stay here again.
741268950953419301,831347778582694305,2023-02-20,385781479,Craig,Fun unique house kept us all comfortable and entertained. Christopher thought of everything and was generous with amenities. Great communicator and house was spotlessly clean. Overall was a cozy place to spend a night passing through town on a road trip.

The host was super responsive and helpful and the location was perfect. He even told us what back road to use to get to our destination. If we come back next year I hope to stay at the same place!
741268950953419301,849378453860941864,2023-03-17,89870457,Lenore,This is an awesome place. If you have kids there is space for them and the adults..loved the upgraded bathrooms! Water pressure was super fabulous!!!!

741373589140804006,790719729357568923,2022-12-26,327846572,William,"We stayed at Darren's place for Christmas while visiting family in Salem, and we couldn't have had a better experience. We greatly appreciated his proactive assistance as we dealt with travel delays, and the flexibility he offered with checking in and out. The home itself is very comfortable, cozy and clean throughout, and we appreciated Darren's kind gesture of installing Christmas decorations before our arrival including a Christmas tree for us to enjoy during our stay — making it feel like home for us. We would definitely consider booking this place with Darren again!"

746708268846088111,763885983500902858,2022-11-19,95616319,Chivonne,"All around 5 star experience. Casey and his family are fantastic hosts - very friendly and responsive. They even left a welcome note and treats. The place looks exactly like it does in the photos and was well-stocked with everything needed for our stay just shy of a week. It’s a short drive to everything in town, but many stores and restaurants are within walking distance. It’s near a busy main street but road noise is buffered because the house is tucked away on a nice wooded street and next to a park. The wifi held up well under the data demands of telework, gaming & streaming. If you’re looking for somewhere clean (NO allergens! No pets, dust mites, heavy fragrances), spacious, well stocked, on a quiet residential street and with an awesome host, this is the one."

749513190648603576,840738015376339440,2023-03-05,230572252,Curt,"Nicole's place was perfect for our needs. Located very well for our needs this trip, near multiple restaurants and coffee shops, and walking distance to the theater our event was being held at. Very private and secure accommodations, with a full kitchen and everything we needed to truly make ourselves at home. Nicole even had some yummy fruit and snacks available for us! Adjacent to a beautiful waterfront park with geese and an old fashioned carousel... You really can't go wrong with this location. Parking can be a challenge in the area, but it's worth the effort to work out the timing with the 3 hour limitations. Overall, this was one of the best stays we've had through AirBnB!!"

I contacted Michelle and asked if we coukd have our Thanksgiving dinner at her place! she agreed! Her home is beautiful and spacious and we loved how each room had its own personality! the house was clean and perfect to accommodate all of us! Michelle was there to answer any questions I had and informed me not to hesitate to contact her anytime. my family had a wonderful time! thank yoy Michelle for having us crat special memories at your home! the Spot is THE SPOT! <br/><br/>ALSO her rules of house are funny! the roof is off limits!! lol 🤣
751613443453571574,786347470070931767,2022-12-20,268806977,Chelsea,"Quick overnight trip in a beautiful location.  Elegant living spaces with really fun bedrooms.  Luckily we had no need for the 4th room, but the air bnb description does state that this is a 4 bedroom home for rent, and we found that the 4th bedroom (the cloud room) was empty and did not have a bed or anything in it for sleeping.  Also worth noting that two of the bedrooms share a jack-and-jill type bathroom which ended up being great for us.  Everything was well stocked and beautifully decorated, and the host was great at communicating with me before our stay.  Overall we would stay here again as we enjoyed our time and stay in the area!"

The host was very helpful and responsive. The only thing on my wishlist would be a coffee maker. But other than that the house is absolutely perfect for a little getaway!!! We will definitely stay there again!

If you asked if I would stay there again I’d say shut up and take my money lol. Thank you for a relaxing stay Michelle.
751613443453571574,835582563120219582,2023-02-26,117560208,Valerie,"Michelle had a lovely home, it was clean and the unique decor in each room was a great touch! The beds and sofa were also very comfy. We came to the area for our daughters basketball tournament and the location of this home was close to each place she played. Michelle was quick to respond when we needed to get in touch with her as well! We would definitely stay again."

My check-in was a breeze and we were so impressed by how nicely appointed the studio was, especially for the amazing price point. We were in town for a quick visit and it was so centrally located and easy to get downtown! We will definitely stay here again when we need to stay in town."

Close to delicious restaurants, the River front park and carousel, downtown shopping and the beautiful capital. The hosts are responsive, helpful and warm. They give clear instructions and offer excellent communication. The space is clean and inviting- matches pictures perfectly. It has everything you need for comfort and peace right in the heart of the city!"

We just started a night but even then the room was a lovely space to enjoy, the hosts were even kind enough to leave us some goodies to share our one night together. Everything was spotless and very comfortable! Thank you again would love to come back someday!"
755877635014519688,774015673028104331,2022-12-03,187913801,Bailey,A lovely little private area! I walked to a nearby donut shop in the morning and it was such a peaceful walk through the neighborhood! Love the location and the hosts were attentive.

755877635014519688,784186774838082281,2022-12-17,179985788,Marisa,Ali created an amazing stay especially given it is a private studio style room in the basement. There was never noise from the upstairs and it was very conveniently located. She was also a very responsive and helpful host. I would recommend staying here if you’re in need of somewhere quiet and close to downtown! Price was also great for what we received.
755877635014519688,784902469394573513,2022-12-18,3641721,Melissa,"Ali’s place has everything you would need for a long stay. The compact kitchen was well laid out and stocked with everything we could have needed. The shower had great pressure, and plenty of hot water, the little table perfect for two. So many restaurants and activities close by. We only stayed one night but would have been comfortable there for a much longer stay. Private, peaceful, a perfect stay. Very responsive to our questions about checkin. Thank you!"
755877635014519688,787082519676750387,2022-12-21,434858133,Sara,"What a gem! Ali’s hideaway space was perfect and so much more than expected. Not only was the place pristine, shower was spotless, amenities were even more than we needed, and we felt right at home. My husband even remarked, as we entered the space, “this just looks exactly like you’d want an Air BnB to look!”  While other Air BnBs may have provided unique experiences, this was by far the most full and professional accommodations we’ve ever stayed at. <br/><br/>This space had 100% private access and no need to see anyone else in the house. <br/><br/>Ali’s was always on top of her communication, giving us full instructions before we arrived as well as setting the expectation for our departure. <br/><br/>We would definitely stay here again. Thank you!"

In addition, the instructions for locking it were not quite clear, but Ali was very responsive to my messages.<br/>The location and price were ideal for our needs - should I return to Salem (and I would like to) I would definitely stay with Ali again!  Thank you, Ali!"
755877635014519688,797183755888193020,2023-01-04,275051934,Tyler,"Really cute lil studio, perfect for single or double use. Bed was comfy, and that little heating unit worked well! <br/><br/>The only downside is being a basement, you can hear the majority of footsteps going over you. Once I put in my noice cancelling headphones though, I was fine! <br/><br/>Very affordable and cute stay!"

The location and everything in the little apartment were perfect. Just what we were joining for and all the little touches and great communication were icing on top. Would highly recommend!

The Airbnb is in the basement, so it offers privacy from the house that is attached. It was very clean and Ali did a great job communicating with me. The electric stovetop was having some issues and Ali quickly came to the rescue and made accommodations for a replacement. I enjoyed my stay here and I would recommend to any couples for a cozy hideaway!"

Close to Willamette University was a plus. Grace was responsive to questions. Nice private home, host in front house."
759442242389416627,809527181956174528,2023-01-21,52662379,Yama,It’s very over price and it does not even have TV in your bedroom which is cost $100 for that price you should expect to have at least TV lol <br/>One room upstairs doesn’t even have a wall  <br/>It’s not private at all and it doesn’t have second bedroom which is annoying
759442242389416627,813133536107128025,2023-01-26,98943006,Ryan,"Wonderful place, very modern and well put together."

The kitchen, although small, had everything you needed to cook a great meal. The two king-size beds were wonderfully comfortable! The bathroom made me feel like I was at a spa. We’ll be back!"
761020547818487329,792207541500822993,2022-12-28,220877462,Marissa,"I loved my stay at Far East Escape! I did have a slight issue getting into the building but Ellen was so responsive that it basically didn’t happen. The amenities in the pantry basically saved me as I came in on Christmas Eve and everything was closed! The bed was comfortable, I felt right at home with all the adorable decor!"

769880376869091272,795031673260887918,2023-01-01,95616319,Chivonne,"This place is located in a quiet residential area. It’s walkable and there is a small park a few blocks away. The cute dishes, great vacuum & neighborhood were the highlights. There were some challenges. There were ant traps in the living room, but ants in the bathroom/kitchen. I sprayed, it helped. There was pet hair EVERYWHERE, even inside of the tea kettle and the beds. I removed the sheets to wash them and was absolutely horrified by the mattress cover. It should be disposed of ASAP. I provided my own mattress cover/bedding/pillows. The bed frame is broken, so it feels/sounds like sleeping on an old rollaway bed. The shower is too small to extend a leg. The seating in the living room is not comfy, but that’s where the only tv is. There is not a complete set of cookware. I really wanted to love this cute place, but it’s just not as nice as it looks. I’d recommend it for a photo shoot or IG worthy sleepover, but not for a long term stay."

808194120211324072,822551660654988407,2023-02-08,82164517,Jody,"This host has several properties in the area. I stayed in the spacious guest room in the host's primary residence. It's a beautifully restored older home with lovely decor, and is clean, neat, and well maintained. The host is friendly and is well informed about the town of Salem. I appreciated the no-pet policy due to allergies. Future guests may wish to know the host prefers to leave the front door of the home unlocked except overnight. If that's not a concern, this accommodation is highly recommended."

The huge backyard was cute, especially at night with the backyard lights which was great for the warm spring evening. Id like to come back to the listing for a weekend to tour the wineries in the Salem area Willamette Valley"
