ENGLISH
I was born in Germany and I'm living in Berlin for about 40 years now. I am married and have two children. As a journalist, I worked for various TV channels, e.g. RIAS TV, Deutsche Welle TV, n-tv news-channel. Now I'm working as a press officer for an international charityorganization. I love traveling and I'm fascinated particularly from Asian and African countries and their people. Reading a book is fun and I'm either fascinated by a good thriller as well as non-fiction books on political issues, foreign cultures and people. On television I mostly watch documentaries about foreign countries and cultures. But a good movie enjoys me as well.
I find it important that my guests feel at home. If there are problems or something is missing - just call. In my absence, my husband Michael takes care of everything.

Ich spiele gerne Skat und Doppelkopf- wenn sich ein Partner dafür findet

Allow me to introduce myself: André, 26, Friedrichshainer.
I've been living in this wonderful neighborhood since nearly four years and I don't wanna miss one single day! Of course, there have been times where I complained about noisy people right under my window outside at night or about my favourite bar being fully-packed, but everytime I'm walking down the streets in my beloved neighborhood with its interesting-looking people coming from all over the world and the huge selection of bars and restaurants, I'm glad to be part of it! It's so relaxing to know that you get everything you want 24/7 and that you can easily meet up with friends in the park nearby, although you're not perfectly dressed up because people do not give a F*** here! :)

I came to Berlin four years ago due to my bachelor university program ""International Business"". I started looking for an own flat because of some unpleasant flat sharing experiences before and I found this sunny top floor flat in the heart of Berlin. Now I alreday finished my bachelor's degree and continued with the master's programm. Besides studying marketing, finance or accounting, I'm pretty easygoing and love spending time with my friends, especially in Friedrichshain , Kreuzberg or Mitte.
Further, I do enjoy swimming, visiting concerts, dancing or chilling in the park.
When you guys arrive, I will personally hand over the keys and will be glad to give you further information on my favorite places in Berlin and all other stuff like public transportation, shopping, museums etc...
Maybe we can also meet up for drinks and you guys can already report about your first impressions of my flat, the neighborhood and your time in Berlin.

Can't wait to get to know you ;)

This is my own working and living space and I only rent it out while being abroad for longer. For that reason I usually prefer to rent it out to one party during for the whole period, (so I don´t have to organize transitions in my absence). But of course it is also possible.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />The studio is part of an old turn of the century building complex situated on the 4th floor in east- west direction and has an elevator.

This used to be a run down industrial area with lots of factory ruins around. you can walk down to the river in 2 minutes. Although very central it was a no mans land, because in this area used to be the border between East and West.  Now it is an example of gentrification versus squat culture. At this point you can still see both. Since I have moved in here residential and commercial buildings have been mushrooming all around my place. At the same time there is still Tipiland, an alternative tent settlement at the river, the Köpi, one of the oldest still existing squats a few meters down the road and a couple blocks south you are in the heart of northern Kreuzberg (SO 36) but there is also a park nearby with a pond where I skate when the ice is frozen (Engelbecken). As the place is situated on the edge between Friedrichshain, Mitte and Kreuzberg no neighbourhood (including prenzlauer berg or neukölln) is really far away.

My name is Gee and I am a passionate traveller, a very responsible and respectful guest, who doesn’t party. 
As a host I love to host a few dinners with 1-2 friends but would not overstep the boundaries of your comfort zone. 

I’m one of the few Berliners you scarcely meet on your travels through the city. Besides of three languages such as English, German and Vietnamese I speak a little Spanish and maybe French... 

I am not a cleaning freak but like to keep the common areas such as kitchen as bathroom neat, nice and tidy. No matter if I'm host or guest. 
I have been in my smokefree apartment for almost 15 years now (of which I actually only lived 9,5 full years in since I have lived in Vietnam, the U.S., the UK and Costa Rica meanwhile as well). My home is my sanctuary and I love to keep it as that. And I wish for every guest I am hosting to treat my place as it was their home as well! In good and bad times :)

This Delux Apartment has a perfect location, lying in a part of Mitte that is just close enough to the hotel area but also in a cool street with lots of new cafes and restaurants that makes you feel like a real Berliner.

Another museum that's a five min walk is Berlin's Natural History Museum. <br /><br />For eating my favourite places around are Bonfini (an italian restaurant nearby), also Chicago WIlliams BBQ serves an amazing meat menu and is quite near.

I take pleasure preparing the room for a new traveller, make him comfortable and welcome. It's always a surprise to discover a new personality especially that you people come from all over the world!
As an Hostess I'm never the same, I guess cause I adapt myself to you: If you want privacy that's fine with me, if you need some help or a little chat I'm here for you too!

I am an open-minded, nice and tidy person to have around who loves to meet new people with different cultural background. This had already started when I was quite young since my parents used to travel around with me a lot. Which was also the beginning of my travel addiction and longing for more of getting to know different cultures. 
Besides travelling, I love to do various sports starting from kickboxing to table tennis over to football. Though at the moment I am focussing rather on kickboxing. During the rest of my freetime, I love to hang around with friends and discover new places in my city, as well as going to the movies and reading.

My motto in life: Respect every single person and treat them as you want to be treated yourself.

I firmly believe you choose AirBnb because you want a genuine experience; a stay with that extra something that hotels just can't provide. That extra something I aim to deliver. It can be local knowledge, a trip around the blocks, someone to help you plan your trip before you're here, a host that may recommend and book tables or places, or in other ways improve your stay. I'm here to help, and I want you to have a great time, whatever that entails, or means to you.

I'm a Norwegian journalist - and a freelance foreign correspondent - currently commuting between work in Oslo, Norway and spare time in Berlin, Germany. I've been travelling alone for years - on several continents - and hopefully you'll benefit from my experiences. I do believe I know a few things about what a traveller appreciates on the road. 

I love cooking; healthy, vegetarian or not, Norwegian seafood, anything that might tickle the taste buds. I read Spanish, German and Scandinavian languages too, but please allow me to reply to your message in English :)

I'm looking forward to hear from you. Welcome you are!

my name is Chantal and I am a mechanical engineering student from Berlin, Germany. I am an open-minded, nice and tidy person to have around who loves to meet new people with different cultural background. This had already started when I was quite young since my parents used to travel around with me a lot. Which was also the beginning of my travel addiction and longing for more of getting to know different cultures. 
Besides travelling, I love to do various sports starting from kickboxing to table tennis over to football. Though at the moment I am focussing rather on kickboxing. During the rest of my freetime, I love to hang around with friends and discover new places in my city, as well as going to the movies and reading.

My motto in life: Respect every single person and treat them as you want to be treated yourself.

I am looking forward to stay with you.

My interest is valid for painting, politics, history, biology and aviation. I am close-knit since the my studies with the history of Berlin and I would like to give an understanding of this also to my guests. Berlin is an inspiring place. Until 1989 you had to pass the Iron Curtain if you wanted to visit the two halfs of Berlin. After the breackdown of the wall Berlin re-experienced a reincarnation. Creative people from all over the world came to this place and enriched its cultural charisma, also by painting the last pieces of the Berlin wall. But Berlin was also in the centre of two World wars and of the Holocaust. The traces of these historical events of the mankind shaped the character of the town in many ways. Berlin was also a front town during the Cold war. American and Soviet tanks were stationed in the two parts of the now German capital and ready to fight the Third world war. Last but not least Berlin is a world-known cultural centre with famous museums and art galeries. Prominent castles, well known museums, world-famous theaters, historical places, old churches and other buildings belong to these highlights like in other European capitals.  But many attractions of Berlin are situated in the neighborhood and not in the town itself. Some of the German kings and emperors  erected important palaces outside of the capital because they didn' t like the old buildings of their fathers and grandfathers or they had other reasons. At the end of the Second World War most of Berlin was destructed. The victorious Allied Powers needed locations outside of Berlin to discuss and decide the further destinity of Germany. So they went to Potsdam. Last but not least the Berlin wall did not only devide the two parts of Berlin but it also surrounded and confined West-Berlin. Famous ""holes in the wall"" like the Glienicke Bridge are today part of this neighborhood.

Je m’appelle Delphine et j’habite à Berlin. 

Ce que j’adore ? Voyager et découvrir de nouvelles cultures ! 
Lors de mes déplacements, je trouve très agréable de loger dans un appartement, alors j’ai décidé de me lancer et de mettre les chambres de mes grands enfants étudiants sur Airbnb.
Je serais ravie de vous y accueillir  et j’espère que vous vous y sentirez comme chez vous :-)


Très bon séjour et à bientôt !

--------------------

Hello,

My name is Delphine and I live in Berlin.

What do I love ? Travelling and discovering new cultures ! 

When I am abroad, I find it extremely pleasant to stay in an apartment, so I have decided to start and use the airbnb services for the bedrooms of my grown-up kids.
I would be delighted to welcome you and hope you will feel right at home :-)


Have a really nice stay and see you soon !
