I enjoy winter skiing,  summer hiking , road trips or river trips, music, reading and favorite small children.  History, gardening, poetry and literature, food, agriculture are some of my interests.  Turkey, Greece, Ukraine, Mexico, Switzerland and France are places I've settled in for several weeks at a time.  In fact, staying in one place while exploring all around suits me better than continuous travel, and that's the experience I'd like to enable as a host.  Salem itself has much to offer besides options for scenic day trips: to the Pacific, to wineries of all sorts, cities north and south (Portland and Eugene), the Columbia Gorge and Mt Hood, waterfalls and forests, art galleries and museums.
One of my strengths is connecting folks with resources and opportunities.  At work, that's been my focus in helping newcomers with cultural adjustment.  Helping guests get the most from their time here appeals to me.  I also value independence and privacy, so knowing what guests prefer can make a good stay for us both.

We have been renting our house to commuters and friends for over 10 years (even before Airbnb) so we are very used to shared spaces/renting private rooms. When we travel (as we like to a lot), we rent out the entire house. Music and learning and relationships are other passions in life.

Most recently, I have enjoyed “packing down” my bike with gear and heading down the road - for an overnight, or three, or three weeks.  This gives a whole new meaning to “bed and breakfast”.

When I’m not cycling, I’m usually busy cooking, cleaning, reading, sewing or watching the trees and flowers grow in my little forest; and, of course, accommodating the many fascinating guests who find their way to Century House from all corners of the globe.  My life is truly enriched by the diversity of perspectives and experiences that guests bring with them.

I confess, my favorite guests may be the children. With a full career of working in the field of early childhood, I never cease to be wowed by the uninhibited enthusiasm, curiosity, and resilience of the younger generation.  I am thrilled and dedicated to being a family-friendly business.

Another of my endeavors is the promotion/education of good nutrition.  I might be seen pedaling to a local farm to fill my packs with broccoli for the local food bank  - or, with fresh kale for a morning smoothie :-).  Don’t worry, there is still room for a brownie or an oatmeal cookie on the dessert tray.  After all, we need our dark chocolate, and our oatmeal, right?

Over the years, Tom has planted apple and cherry trees, a plum tree, a fig tree, rhubarb, herbs and tomatoes, and a big berry patch full of blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries and currants. We like to call it ""Tom's Berry Farm"" but it isn't really a farm - though we sometimes joke that we could probably open up a roadside stand with all the produce.

Family is the most important thing to us and we enjoy spending time with our kids and grand kids. Other interests include cooking, reading, salmon fishing and volunteering for local charities like the Marion County Food Bank and Assistance League.

Most recently, I have enjoyed “packing down” my bike with gear and heading down the road - for an overnight, or three, or three weeks.  This gives a whole new meaning to “bed and breakfast”.

When I’m not cycling, I’m usually busy cooking, cleaning, reading, sewing or watching the trees and flowers grow in my little forest; and, of course, accommodating the many fascinating guests who find their way to Century House from all corners of the globe.  My life is truly enriched by the diversity of perspectives and experiences that guests bring with them.

I confess, my favorite guests may be the children. With a full career of working in the field of early childhood, I never cease to be wowed by the uninhibited enthusiasm, curiosity, and resilience of the younger generation.  I am thrilled and dedicated to being a family-friendly business.

Another of my endeavors is the promotion/education of good nutrition.  I might be seen pedaling to a local farm to fill my packs with broccoli for the local food bank  - or, with fresh kale for a morning smoothie :-).  Don’t worry, there is still room for a brownie or an oatmeal cookie on the dessert tray.  After all, we need our dark chocolate, and our oatmeal, right?

I went on a 2 week  cruise through the Panama Canal, Central America and just touching South America most recently, and prior to that I spent a month in the Greek Isles. I have been to Hungary, England, Germany,  Scotland and Italy, and have also been to Thailand, Costa Rica, Ireland, Belgium, Spain, New Zealand, Mexico, Portugal, Canada and more. Lately I’ve been sticking closer to home- San Francisco, Phoenix, AZ and the Oregon coast.
During the warmer months I like to get on the river kayaking-flat water and garden. My house is full of books which you are welcome to. I like tea, rocks, playing pool, spicy food, getting together with family and friends. Laughter is important to me. 
I am an RN. I eat a vegetarian diet but have no problem if you do not.
I grew up in Portland, lived away for 7 years and returned when I started my family. I raised my 3 daughters essentially on my own with a little help from my folks and siblings. They are grown now-my oldest living in Alaska, the other 2 in Oregon- the youngest is only a couple miles away. 
I am love being an airbnb host! I work from home so am available most of the time. 
 Smoking is OK on the back patio and front porch if desired, away from open doors and windows. 
The Portland metro area has much to offer and I like to get out for the experience. I am open but know how to give people their space. Feel free to ask me anything. 
I enjoy helping people, fun, new faces and places. I like games and friendly competition, movies, being outside, and the feel of a good book in my hands. I've lately started watching some shows on HBO, Netflix and Hulu after a long hiatus from TV. I have a soft spot for sci-fi and fantasy-don't judge! Traveling is important to me.
I have an old, sweet boxer named Gypsy who will likely want to greet you, but sleeps most of the time.
My daughters come to visit sometimes with their husbands and pups too.

Most recently, I have enjoyed “packing down” my bike with gear and heading down the road - for an overnight, or three, or three weeks.  This gives a whole new meaning to “bed and breakfast”.

When I’m not cycling, I’m usually busy cooking, cleaning, reading, sewing or watching the trees and flowers grow in my little forest; and, of course, accommodating the many fascinating guests who find their way to Century House from all corners of the globe.  My life is truly enriched by the diversity of perspectives and experiences that guests bring with them.

I confess, my favorite guests may be the children. With a full career of working in the field of early childhood, I never cease to be wowed by the uninhibited enthusiasm, curiosity, and resilience of the younger generation.  I am thrilled and dedicated to being a family-friendly business.

Another of my endeavors is the promotion/education of good nutrition.  I might be seen pedaling to a local farm to fill my packs with broccoli for the local food bank  - or, with fresh kale for a morning smoothie :-).  Don’t worry, there is still room for a brownie or an oatmeal cookie on the dessert tray.  After all, we need our dark chocolate, and our oatmeal, right?
